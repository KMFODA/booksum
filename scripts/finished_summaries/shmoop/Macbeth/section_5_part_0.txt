Lady Macbeth is pretty charming here--she says that the Macbeths are grateful for the \"honours\" bestowed on Macbeth by the king and tells the men to make themselves at home. There's a whole lot of very formal \"You're so gracious.\" \"No you're the one who's so gracious\" talk here before Lady Macbeth finally takes the king to see her husband.", "analysis": ""}
