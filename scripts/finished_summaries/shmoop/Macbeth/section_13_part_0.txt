Conveniently, they have a torch--good for seeing by. Banquo starts up with a friendly \"it looks like rain\" conversation and is promptly stabbed. While being stabbed, he denounces the treachery and encourages Fleance to run away and eventually take revenge. In the meantime, the torch has gone out, and Fleance takes advantage of the darkness to escape. With Banquo dead and Fleance on the run, the murderers head off to the dinner party to report the half of the job they've done.", "analysis": ""}
