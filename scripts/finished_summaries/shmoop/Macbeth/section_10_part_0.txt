{"name": "Act 2, Scene 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210605115042/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/macbeth/summary/act-2-scene-4", "summary": "Ross chats with a conveniently placed wise old man, who is disturbed by the night's strange events--both the King's murder and the weird things going on in nature. Ross says the heavens are clearly troubled by the unnatural regicide: even though it's the middle of the day, it's completely dark outside; an owl murdered a hawk; Duncan's horses ate each other. Okay, that seriously sounds like something out of The Exorcist. Macduff, yet another Scottish nobleman, offers some exposition, too: he says the dead guards \"were bribed\" to murder the king ; that Malcolm and Donalbain look pretty suspicious, having left town so quickly and all ; that Macbeth is on his way to Scone to be crowned King; and that Duncan is being put in a freshly dug grave. Time for a new act.", "analysis": ""}
