On their heels, heading for Birnam, is the English army, led by Malcolm, Malcom's Uncle Siward, and Macduff. Oh, and a bunch of young Scottish men have taken up arms with the English army. This is not looking good for Macbeth. Some dude name Cathness informs the group that the tyrant King is hell-bent on protecting Dunsinane. It's pretty clear that his actions are in his own interests and not the nation's. Everyone agrees that Macbeth's a lousy king and needs to go.", "analysis": ""}
