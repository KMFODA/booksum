He's about to go into the Council Chamber when a keeper stops him. Dr. Butts, the king's doctor, enters and remarks that there must be malice in the air. Then he leaves. Cranmer says to himself that it's strange that he--one of the council member--has to wait outside. He hopes Butts will be a pal and be nice to him. Butts and Henry look out of a window above Cranmer. Butts points out Cranmer to the king, and says it's strange for the Archbishop of Canterbury to rub elbows with pages and footboys outside. You're right, Henry says. That is Cranmer waiting outside. Wait, so that means something is not right. It's a trap! Henry decides they will hear about it later, but for now, should keep watching the council meeting from above.", "analysis": ""}
