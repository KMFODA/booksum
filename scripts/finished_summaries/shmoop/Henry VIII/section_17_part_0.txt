The Mayor, Garter, Alderman, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cranmer, and of course the royals themselves. The Garter presents the baby--Princess Elizabeth--to the crowd. In case you missed it, this baby is totally the future Queen Elizabeth I. Cranmer kneels and prays for comfort and joy for the happy royal fam. Then he baptizes the baby and gives her a blessing and a kiss on the head. Henry thanks Cranmer, but Cranmer isn't done yet. He delivers a long speech about how wonderful Elizabeth will be for England. She'll be a great ruler, loved by the people but feared by them as well. When Elizabeth dies, all her goodness and truth will continue in the next ruler after her. Let's not get ahead of ourselves--she's only a baby at this point, right? But the king is blown away by Cranmer's vision for his baby daughter. Then Henry tells Cranmer that his speech made him a happy guy. He's never been this happy before. Now he can't wait to see what his girl does. He thanks Anne for having the baby, and he makes the day a public holiday.", "analysis": ""}
