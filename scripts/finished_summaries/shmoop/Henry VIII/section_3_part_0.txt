{"name": "Act 1, Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201030103416/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/henry-viii/summary/act-1-scene-3", "summary": "Lord Chamberlain and Lord Sands talk about--what else?--what happened on the nobles' trip to France, and about what's taken place since. Chamberlain thinks it's ridiculous how men are suddenly wearing French clothes and practicing French customs, now that they've seen how the French do things. Then Lovell comes over to say that the nobles are supposed to give these French things up. Everyone agrees that this is best. After a few more jabs at the French, Chamberlain asks Lovell where he's off to. Lovell's off to Wolsey's house, of course, and Chamberlain and Lovell are invited, too. Lovell says Wolsey is \"bounteous,\" and Chamberlain follows that up by saying that he's \"noble,\" too. Sands couldn't agree more. Wolsey is such a great \"example\" to all of them. The men sing Wolsey's praises as they run off to his house for dinner.", "analysis": ""}
