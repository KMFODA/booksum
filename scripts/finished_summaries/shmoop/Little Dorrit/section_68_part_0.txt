He keeps going over and over the numbers in his head - and on paper they should both have been very rich by now. The more he stresses, the more Casby annoys him. But he is used to his job and has been harassing the Bleeding Heart Yard tenants like before. One day, though, Casby calls Pancks into a meeting. He has a bunch of annoying demands: 1) get even more money out of the Bleeding Heart Yard people - squeeze them for all they're worth; 2) tell Flora to stop going to see Arthur in prison; and 3) stop going to see Arthur yourself while we're at it. Man, that's some evil boss! Pancks kind of says \"oh\" to all of this, but lets it go. As soon as Casby leaves, Pancks follows him. They both end up in Bleeding Heart Yard. Pancks calls Casby out in front of all the people there. He tells everyone that it's actually Casby and not Pancks who is the greedy one. He has no sympathy for the people and just wants to squeeze them dry. Pancks then tells them the only reason Casby looks so nice is because he has all that beautiful hair, which makes him look like a Biblical patriarch. Casby is too dull-witted to be able to respond to this. Suddenly, Pancks knocks Casby's hat off his head, whips out a pair of scissors, and hacks off all of his hair. Casby stands there, now a laughingstock.", "analysis": ""}
