Griffin says he had planned to go someplace warm, like South America, where he wouldn't have to wear clothes . But since he met Kemp, he's changed his plans. Griffin now realizes how little one person can do on his own. Invisibility is especially useful for killing people, so Griffin plans to establish a new Reign of Terror - with Kemp's help, of course. First, though, he needs to get his books back from Marvel, who is locked up at the jail for his own safety. Suddenly, Griffin hears some people sneaking up in the house, and he realizes that Kemp has betrayed him. Sad and angry, Griffin takes off his clothes. Kemp tries to capture Griffin with the help of the three men, including Colonel Adye, the police captain who got Kemp's letter in Chapter 18. Griffin pushes past them and escapes.", "analysis": ""}
