Pistol takes the soldier prisoner and demands a ransom, which the French soldier agrees to . Since Pistol and the French Soldier don't understand each other, the Boy has to translate everything. The Boy complains to us that Pistol is nothing but a loudmouth braggart. He then reveals to us that Nim has been hanged for stealing, just like Bardolph. The Boy heads back to the English camp, where the rest of the young pages have to stay behind while the men duke it out on the battlefield.", "analysis": ""}
