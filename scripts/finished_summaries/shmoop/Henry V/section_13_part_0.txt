The Constable worries that they'll have to hand over their French vineyards to the \"barbarous\" English. Bourbon calls the English a bunch of \"bastard Normans\" and the Dauphin declares that the English are nothing but \"a few sprays of us.\" The Dauphin claims that some of the French people are rooting for the English. He worries that their women will \"give their bodies to the lust of the English youth.\" King Charles orders the troops to pummel the English and take Henry prisoner. Meanwhile, Henry's soldiers are lagging - the English troops are exhausted and sick, so the French think it's likely that they'll soon back down.", "analysis": ""}
