Still, the fighting's not over. Exeter shows up and debriefs King Henry: The Earl of Suffolk and the Duke of York have been killed in battle. Through tears, Exeter describes how a wounded and bloody York spotted his dead cousin and lay down beside him to die. Exeter apologizes for crying like a sissy but Henry says it's okay - the story has moved him to tears also. When Henry hears an alarum , he's all \"Oh no they didn't!\" and orders his soldiers to kill all the French war prisoners. Pistol cries out \"Coup la gorge!\"", "analysis": ""}
