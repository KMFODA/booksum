Brain Snack: For the Welsh, wearing a leek in one's hat on St. Davy's Day was as patriotic as Americans eating too many hotdogs and lighting fireworks on Independence Day. Fluellen tells us that he's still wearing the leek because, yesterday, Pistol insulted him by sending him some salt and bread . When Pistol shows up, Fluellen beats him severely and crams the leek in his mouth. Then Fluellen gives Pistol some money and tells him to scram. Gower points out that Pistol got what was coming to him. Next time, Pistol will think twice before messing with a guy just because he's got a whacky Welsh accent. Left alone on stage, Pistol relates some sad news: His wife, Mistress Quickly, has died of venereal disease. Pistol decides that, since he no longer has a wife to go home to, he's going to become a pimp.", "analysis": ""}
