Mistress Quickly and Pistol enter and talk about their family business. Their conversation sounds a lot like this: \"Dang. We're so tired of everyone accusing us of running a 'bawdy house' when all we're trying to do is run an honest business.\" Nim gets all bent out of shape and we find out why. Apparently, he was engaged to Mistress Quickly before she ran off and married Pistol. Nim threatens to slit Pistol's throat and the two men draw their swords before Bardolph manages to break up the argument. A Boy runs in and declares that Sir John Falstaff is deathly ill. Mistress Quickly, Nim, and Pistol agree that Falstaff is dying of a broken heart because King Henry unfriended him.", "analysis": ""}
