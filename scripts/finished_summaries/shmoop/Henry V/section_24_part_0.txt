Fluellen accuses Williams of being a traitor and says that Williams should be arrested. The two men scream at each other until King Henry steps forward and confesses that he's playing a joke on them. He admits that he's the one who exchanged gloves with Williams when the two bickered back at camp the night before. Williams is shocked, but he defends himself and says that he didn't know he was arguing with the king, since Henry was disguised as a commoner. Henry fills the glove with some coins and gives it to Williams, who is pretty ticked off that he's been punked. When Fluellen tries to give Williams some more money so he can go out and buy a new pair of shoes , Williams feels insulted. An unnamed English Herald shows up and we learn about the casualties of war: Ten thousand French soldiers have been counted dead . Miraculously, only four English nobles and twenty-five commoners have been killed in battle. Henry orders a procession through the local village and says anyone who doesn't give God props for the English victory will be put to death.", "analysis": ""}
