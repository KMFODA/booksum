The French are overly cocky while the underdog Englishmen are worried about what will happen come morning. The Chorus also tells us that King Henry has been walking around camp trying to cheer up his soldiers. Even though Henry is worried , he's put on a brave face to comfort his exhausted men. The Chorus apologizes for the theater's inability to justly portray the upcoming battle of Agincourt.", "analysis": ""}
