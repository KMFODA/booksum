The Captain tells the Earl of Salisbury that he's sick and tired of waiting for Richard. He's going to send all his men home if Richard doesn't show up in the next two seconds. When Salisbury begs him to stay just one more day, the Welsh Captain says forget about it. Everyone thinks the king is dead anyway. The Captain and his army leave. Salisbury notes that when Richard shows up he's going to be totally screwed, because he'll have little to no protection.", "analysis": ""}
