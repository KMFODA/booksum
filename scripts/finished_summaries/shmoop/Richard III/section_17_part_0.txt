{"name": "Act 4, Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210504161507/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/richard-iii/summary/act-4-scene-3", "summary": "Tyrrell, the murderer, arrives back at the palace in London and reports that the two princes are dead. Tyrrell says he feels guilty and explains that he hired two hit men, Dighton and Forrest, to smother the kids in their sleep. Even the hit men felt bad about offing two little kids. Richard thinks this is the best news he's ever heard. Tyrrell reports that he saw the kids and is certain they're dead, though he doesn't know where they're buried. Richard promises to reward Tyrrell handsomely. In his usual style of giving the audience useful information, Richard fills us in: he's imprisoned Clarence's young son, married off Clarence's daughter to some harmless guy, and killed Edward's sons. Oh, and his wife Anne is dead. Richard reveals that he knows Richmond is also after young Elizabeth's hand . Richard declares he'll be off to woo Elizabeth for himself. Ratcliffe enters with the bad news that Morton Bishop of Ely has actually turned tail and joined Richmond's side. Buckingham is also waiting for Richard on the battlefield, backed by a horde of intimidating Welshmen. Richard declares that Buckingham doesn't scare him, but this Richmond/Ely alliance is bad news. Either way, Richard says he won't waste time lamenting. He's ready to get his battle on.", "analysis": ""}
