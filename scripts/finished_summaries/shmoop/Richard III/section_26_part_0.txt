Richard's horse has been killed, and Richard is wandering the battlefield on foot, killing everything in his path with a fatalistic fury. Richard yells out the famous line, \"A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!\" Richard is mad with bloodlust. He says he's slain five of the six \"Richmonds\" on the field, but not the Richmond he wants. Richard runs off again, looking for horses and Richmond.", "analysis": ""}
