A messenger enters with letters from Hotspur's dad, Northumberland. Turns out, dad can't make it to the battle because he's got the sniffles and can't get out of bed. \"Gee, this is a major setback,\" says Worcester, \"maybe we should hold off on the battle until Northumberland can join us.\" \"Nonsense,\" says Hotspur. \"Our victory will be even more glorious when people find out we've defeated the king's army without my dad's help.\" Douglas agrees with Hotspur, but Worcester worries that the other rebels will think Northumberland is missing because he thinks the battle is a bad idea. Vernon enters with news that Westmoreland and Prince John are marching toward Shrewsbury with 7,000 troops. The king's also on his way and he's got a bunch of soldiers with him. Prince Hal is on his way too and he looks pretty glorious on horseback in all his battle gear. Hotspur, who gets all hot and bothered by Vernon's description of Hal, says bring it. He can't wait to get his battle on with Prince Hal, \"hot horse to horse.\" Vernon delivers more bad news. Glendower can't get his troops together for another couple of weeks. The other rebels will have to fight without him. This is a huge blow but Hotspur decides to forge ahead anyway.", "analysis": ""}
