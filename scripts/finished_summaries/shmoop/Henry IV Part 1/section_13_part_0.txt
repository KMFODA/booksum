Douglas calls Worcester a chicken. Sir Walter Blunt arrives from the king's camp with a peace offering from King Henry. All will be forgiven if the rebels disband and say they're sorry for being bad. Hotspur lays out the Percy family's beef with the king and Walter Blunt says he doesn't want to hear it - the Percys should take the deal. Hotspur says he'll think about it and Blunt returns to the king's camp.", "analysis": ""}
