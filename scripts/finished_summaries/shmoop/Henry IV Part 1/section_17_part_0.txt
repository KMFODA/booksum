Walter Blunt, who is disguised as the king, encounters Douglas. They talk trash and then Douglas kills Blunt. Hotspur enters and gives Douglas props for being such a mighty warrior. Douglas tells Hotspur they can all go home and have a nice hot soak in the tub because he's just killed King Henry. Hotspur points out that Douglas has killed Blunt, not the king. Henry's got a bunch of soldiers dressed like him for protection. Hotspur and Douglas run off to slay some more of the king's men. Falstaff enters and sees Blunt's body on the ground. He reiterates that \"honour\" is a bunch of hogwash. Just look where it got Blunt. Prince Hal joins him and asks to borrow Falstaff's weapon. He finds instead a bottle of wine, so Hal yells at Falstaff for acting like a clown at an inappropriate time. Falstaff waffles with some bull about how he's going to slay Percy if he sees him.", "analysis": ""}
