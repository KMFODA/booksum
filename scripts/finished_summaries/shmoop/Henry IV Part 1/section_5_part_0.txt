Because Poins has hidden Falstaff's horse, Falstaff complains he's too fat to walk - he'll wheeze and fart if he has to waddle too far. Falstaff jokes that Poins has bewitched him because, even though he's a rascal, Falstaff still loves him. Gadshill arrives and greets his cronies, who are hiding in wait. Bardolph says the king's exchequer is coming down the road - everyone be quiet and get ready to pounce! Falstaff worries they'll all be hanged for stealing from the king, but the others are psyched about getting rich. Hal and Poins sneak off and disguise themselves while Falstaff, Gadshill, Bardolph, and Peto lie in wait for the exchequer. After Falstaff and company rob the king's men, Hal and Poins jump out of the bushes and yell \"stick 'em up!\" They slap Falstaff around a bit and take away his stolen loot.
