After Julia begs Proteus to be faithful to her, the couple exchange rings and \"seal the bargain with a holy kiss.\" Proteus says he'll be true to Julia, and if a time should come when he isn't pining for her, he hopes that he'll be immediately punished--like, within the hour. Julia runs off without saying another word. Panthino arrives to fetch Proteus--it's time to ship out.", "analysis": ""}
