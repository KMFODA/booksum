Julia's not hearing any of this. She's in love and wants to be with Proteus, pronto. Julia decides to dress up like a boy to \"prevent\" any unwanted encounters with \"lascivious men\" . She'll tie up her hair in fashionable knots to make her appear older and Lucetta will make her a pair of pants. Lucetta advises Julia to also wear a codpiece. Julia worries that travelling alone and cross-dressing will ruin her reputation, but she decides that it's worth it because Proteus is the most faithful and loyal guy in the world. Julia and Lucetta make preparations for the journey.", "analysis": ""}
