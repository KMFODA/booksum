One of the outlaws says \"stick em' up\" and Valentine proceeds to explain that he's got nothing for the roadside robbers to steal. The outlaws are impressed when they hear that Valentine has been banished from Milan. They're even more impressed when Valentine lies about having \"killed a man.\" The outlaws now think of Valentine as a kind of Robin Hood figure and invite him to join their bad boy club. The outlaws take turns bragging about their crimes and then add that Valentine can be head bad boy if he joins up. Um, and that they'll kill him if he refuses. Valentine agrees to join the outlaw club but makes them promise not to hurt any women or defenseless travelers. They agree and set off to live as a band of happy bachelors.", "analysis": ""}
