Marie's father, Albert Tovesky, was one of the most well respected Bohemian men in Omaha. Marie was his daughter by a second wife. When she was sixteen, Frank Shabata joined her class at Omaha High School, having just moved to Nebraska from Bohemia. Frank was quite the dandy back then. He wore gloves and carried a yellow cane. He gave himself the air of a fancy guy, and said that his mother was a wealthy landowner. He often seemed troubled though, and of course, this really drove the young girls wild. One weekend, Frank and Marie went rowing together. Afterwards, Marie went straight to her father and announced that she was engaged. Her father flipped, and decided to take her to a Catholic school for girls in St. Louis. Now that Frank couldn't have Marie, though, he loved her all the more. Before she left, he managed to meet with her and give her a dozen photographs of himself to keep with her. Marie spent a year at the convent school, until she turned 18. She met Frank at the train station in St. Louis, and they ran off with each other to get married. Her father forgave her, and bought them a farm in the country. Frank takes a yearly trip to the city; otherwise, he works the farm \"like a demon\" . By the time Carl came to visit Alexandra, they had been living together on the Divide for 5 years.", "analysis": ""}
