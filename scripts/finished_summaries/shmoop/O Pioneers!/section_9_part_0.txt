One morning, Carl wakes up early and decides to head over to his family's former homestead. He walks to the boundary between the Bergsons' place and his father's, and waits for the sunrise. He remembers milking the cows with Alexandra at this very spot. As the sun comes up over the prairie, Carl gets up and crosses the fence onto the other property. He sees Emil, holding a gun and advancing slowly towards the pond. Emil is with Marie. Carl figures they're after some ducks. There is a rustle of bird, the gun fires, and five ducks fall. The two of them laugh and gather up the ducks. Just then, Marie's face falls and she reproaches Emil for killing them. Emil gets annoyed, and tells her that she's as bad as old Ivar. He apologizes, though not without a tone of bitterness. The two head off, having not seen Carl. Carl feels \"unreasonably mournful\" to have seen the two young people out together .", "analysis": ""}
