Then the Bastard strolls in, casually holding Austria's head, which he has just lopped off. The Bastard complains that it's kind of hot outside and then puts Austria's head on the ground and tells us it's a shame that King Philip is still alive. Then, in walk King John, Hubert, and Arthur. John has taken little Arthur prisoner. King John tells Hubert to look after the little brat because he's got other things to worry about.
