{"name": "Act 3, Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508171050/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/king-john/summary/act-3-scene-3", "summary": "King John and his posse come back on stage. Now Eleanor is with them. Arthur is still being held prisoner by King John's men. King John tells Arthur not to worry: he'll take good care of him. Next, King John tells the Bastard to go to England and plunder the riches of all the monasteries. The Bastard leaves to do his job. At this point, Eleanor calls Arthur over to her side to have a chat with him. This leaves King John free to have a private chat with Hubert. King John starts off by telling Hubert that he owes him one. Hubert says, \"Hey, no problem.\" Then King John starts acting weird. He says he wants to say something to Hubert, but he can't, because the time isn't right. If it were a dark, gloomy night, and they were standing in a graveyard, then the atmosphere would be right. Hubert is all, \"You can trust me, King John. I'm your loyal subject.\" King John says something like \"You see that little brat over there? He's like a little snake that's always in my way. You know what I'm sayin', Hubert? I sure wish someone would take care of him for me.\" Hubert gets the hint, but then King John can't resist stating the obvious: he tells Hubert that he wants the kid dead and buried ASAP. Hubert says, \"No problem.\" With that out of the way, King John announces that now he can be \"merry,\" and he gets ready to leave. King John says goodbye to his mom and tells Arthur not to worry: Uncle Hubert's going to take really good care of him. Then they all leave the stage. History Snack: Shakespeare's Queen Elizabeth I signed the death warrant of her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots in 1587, just a few short years before Shakespeare wrote King John. Mary was involved in a plot to kill Elizabeth, who was standing between her and the English throne.", "analysis": ""}
