Henry surprises himself by totally forgetting his own fear. He shoots and reloads like a madman. He feels as if he is a part of something large and multi-bodied . There are many excellent descriptions of the injured dead and dying. Really gruesomely gorgeous stuff. When one soldier tries to run away, the lieutenant beats him up. When it is over, Henry feels weary, but proud at seeing the Union flag still flying. He is also amazed to see that the sun is still shining; that nature takes no notice of the bloody deeds done on its tranquil soil.", "analysis": ""}
