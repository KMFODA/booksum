Soon they are running and dropping gear as they go. Henry feels trapped, as if he is caught up in a huge machine. The men run. They hear bullets and explosions off in the distance. Then they see their first dead man. Henry tries to find in the dead man's eyes the answer to the \"Question.\" Henry now undergoes another mood swing . He wants to know why they've run all this way and now they're doing nothing again. He says ,\"I could 'ave walked to home - 'round an' 'round the barn, if I jest wanted to walk\" . Another mood swing; now he thinks it would be better to just get killed and be done with it. Suddenly, the sounds of battle draw incredibly close. Henry changes his mind about dying. Wilson looks weird. He hands Henry a packet of letters and asks Henry to give them to his folks . Henry is flabbergasted.", "analysis": ""}
