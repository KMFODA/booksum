The noise of the battle is incredible. He realizes that the battles before are nothing compared to this. There are dead men lying everywhere. Torn and bleeding men are limping and howling and falling to the ground. He sees a wounded man with a shoe-full of blood, hopping like \"a schoolboy in a game\" and laughing hysterically . A \"tattered man\" latches on to Henry and tries to talk to him. He keeps asking Henry where he is wounded. Henry moves as far away from the tattered man as he can.", "analysis": ""}
