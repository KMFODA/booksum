It's like someone slipped him some super-Prozac while he was sleeping. He smiles as he remembers what a major fighting machine he is. He nods as he considers his own mad skills. His pride and good will knows no bounds. Ah, the glorious manhood of \"the Youth!\" Just then, the Confederates begin firing at his regiment. With great accuracy. Many of the men in Henry's regiment begin running from battle. Henry's throat closes up, his legs turn to water, he throws down his gun and runs \"like a rabbit.\" Hopping and scampering along, he hightails it as far away from the battle as he can get.", "analysis": ""}
