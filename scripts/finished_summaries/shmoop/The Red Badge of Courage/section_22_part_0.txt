It seems the Johnny Rebs are hiding behind this fence and must be flushed out. Henry gets ready to flush. He \"felt the daring spirit of a savage religion-mad. He was capable of profound sacrifices, a tremendous death\" . He thinks of the \"bullets only as things that could prevent him from reaching the place of his endeavor\" . The two armies fight and clash for possession of the all-important fence. Henry sees something else he wants: the Confederate flag! Conveniently, the rebel flag bearer just happens to be wounded. Badly. Henry makes a super-human effort and \"spr at the flag as a panther at prey\" . He manages to obtain the Confederate flag as well as retain his own Union flag. Meanwhile, the Union soldiers have captured some POWs. Henry and the other men are surprised to see how the Confederates look and act just like them, like real people and everything. With the battle over, Henry can once again shoot the breeze with Wilson.", "analysis": ""}
