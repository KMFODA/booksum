Each blade of grass, every tree trunk, the individual corpses, are all suddenly clear to him in a way nothing has ever been before. He and the other men hesitate as if sensing their own deaths, but their lieutenant screams at them in a \"blue haze of curses\" . The lieutenant could \"string oaths with the facility of a maiden who strings beads\" . The men run forward, including Henry, who has suddenly recovered his \"inner war-beast.\" The flag bearer gets shot and nearly drops the flag, but Henry the war-beast grabs the flag and runs with it straight at the enemy, with Wilson's aid.", "analysis": ""}
