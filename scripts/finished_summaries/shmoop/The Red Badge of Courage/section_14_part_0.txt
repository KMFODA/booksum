Henry and Wilson are marching along. Henry suddenly remembers that he has that packet of letters Wilson wanted him to give his family if he died. This makes Henry feels vastly superior to Wilson. In fact, to quote Crane, Henry , \"had performed his mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man\" . Henry's ego inflates to the size of his head . Coincidentally , right at this very moment, Wilson BLUSHES big time and says that Henry can give him the letters back. Henry does, and without acting like too much of a thunder-bag, either. This makes Henry regard himself as \"an individual of extraordinary virtues,\" also known as Self-Image #467 so far.", "analysis": ""}
