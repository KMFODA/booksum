Anyway, as Henry is standing there woolgathering, tons of soldiers start running in his direction. Henry wants to know what in the thunder is going on. He grabs one soldier and tries to get him to tell him. The soldier is all freaked out from fighting, so he takes a whack at Henry, beaming him a huge one on the dome with the butt of his rifle. Henry falls to the ground like a shot deer . He reels around like a sick cat . Henry, who is now pretty much out of it, wanders around with these other injured soldiers. He follows them as it gets dark, even though he has no idea where in the thunder he's going. All of a sudden a \"cheery soldier\" comes up to Henry and happily and perkily leads him back to his rightful regiment, leaving before Henry can ever see his face.", "analysis": ""}
