He looks around and sees the other sleeping men whom he momentarily mistakes for dead bodies. Also, his head is the size of a basketball . Henry is helped by Wilson, a.k.a. \"the Loud Soldier,\" who is no longer the loud soldier, but rather the \"newly mature, and more like a man\" soldier. Henry explains that their friend Jim Conklin has died. Some rowdy soldiers nearby start to fight, but Wilson breaks them up. He tells Henry that their regiment was split up during battle but that the men keep trickling back, just like Henry did.", "analysis": ""}
