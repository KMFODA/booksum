Bullets mainly start to whiz by. Henry's brigade watches the brigade in front of them battling it out. During the Civil War, the fighting produced so much smoke that it was hard to tell what was happening even a few yards in front of you, so the guys spend a lot of time arguing about whether or not the Union forces are getting creamed. Henry's lieutenant gets shot in the hand, leading to much vulgar language to which the reader is not privy. Henry again doubts himself, worrying that he will run away once the battle begins.", "analysis": ""}
