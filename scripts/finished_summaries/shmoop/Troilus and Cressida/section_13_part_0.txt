He promises to love her forever as he holds her in his arms. Troilus and Cressida exchange love tokens. He gives her a \"sleeve\" and she gives him a glove. As our lovebirds say goodbye, Troilus keeps asking Cressida to be faithful to him and promises to come see her that night. Cressida worries that he doesn't trust her and Troilus promises that it's not her he's worried about--it's those young Greek guys who are the problem. You know. Oh, and just in case she was wondering, he's totally not going to cheat on her, either. Aeneas and Diomedes say it's time for Cressida to go. Troilus begs Diomedes to \"use her well\"... or else. Diomedes snickers and promises that they'll take great care of her. As Troilus walks with Cressida and Diomedes to the port, a trumpet announces that Hector and Ajax are about to rumble. Hm, sounds like the plots might be about to converge. Paris and Aeneas run off to watch the two guys throw down.", "analysis": ""}
