Not only that, but a horse is dragging his body around the \"shameful field.\" Troilus prays to the gods and asks for them to \"smile at Troy.\" He says that when they go back home and tell Hector's family about his death, Priam will cry himself to \"stone\" and all of Troy will be devastated. Troilus vows to get revenge on Achilles. When Pandarus shows up, Troilus smacks him around and tells him to scram. He calls him a \"broker, lackey\" and says Pandarus has to live with himself for what he's done. Alone on stage, Pandarus delivers a bitter speech to the audience. He complains about his diseased body, and how poorly he thinks he's been treated. Then he gives a shout-out to all the members of the audience involved in the sex industry. Brain snack: playhouses were in the same neighborhoods as brothels so it's highly likely that Pandarus's speech didn't fall on deaf ears. He tells us that he's dying and says he hopes there aren't any prostitutes in the audience that boo and \"hiss\" at him or the play. Finally, he says that when he dies , he's going to leave us all his sexually transmitted diseases in his will. The End. Yeah. We know you want more. Head over to \"What's Up With the Ending\" for the dirt on Pandarus's speech.", "analysis": ""}
