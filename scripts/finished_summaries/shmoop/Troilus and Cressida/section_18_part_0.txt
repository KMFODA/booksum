Thersites tells us that Diomedes is running around the battlefield with Troilus's \"sleeve\" on his helmet. While he's at it, he rags on Nestor, Ulysses, Ajax, and Achilles. Troilus and Hector run across the stage in mid-battle. Then Hector runs on stage and apparently takes a break from fighting Troilus to challenge Thersites to man-to-man combat....if Thersites thinks he's got the stones for it. But, uh, nope. He doesn't, so Hector lets him live and moves on. Thersites runs off to watch Troilus throw down with Diomedes.", "analysis": ""}
