Hector says something horrible like, \"Woman, you're asking for it with all this nagging.\" We find out that Andromache has been having some \"ominous\" dreams. Speaking of female premonitions, here's crazy Cassandra. Hector's wife and sister beg him not to go because they've both had premonitions of \"bloody turbulence\" and \"slaughter\"--presumably, Hector's. But Hector insists that his \"honor\" is way more important to him than his life. Troilus shows up and Cassandra runs off to get Priam to talk Hector out of fighting. Hector greets Troilus and is all \"Listen, kid, I don't think it's a good idea for you to fight today. Why don't you stay home and let me kill some Greeks for you.\" But Troilus is ready to get his battle on, finally. Prima shows up with Cassandra and begs Hector not to go to battle since Hector's wife, sister, mom, and even Priam have all had visions of his death. Hector goes to battle anyway. Alone on stage, Troilus tells us that he's going to get his \"sleeve\" back from Diomedes on the battlefield. In pops Pandarus with a letter from Cressida. As Troilus reads it, Pandarus gives us way too much information about how he's been feeling sick lately. He's got a nasty cough, a mucous oozing from his eyes, and his bones ache . Troilus announces the letter is full of \"words, words, mere words\" and tears it to shreds. Okay, Troilus, but seriously: what else did you expect a letter to be full of?", "analysis": ""}
