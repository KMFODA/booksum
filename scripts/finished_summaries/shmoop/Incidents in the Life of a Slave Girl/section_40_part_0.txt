Free at last! Not so fast. His daughter and her husband arrive in New York. They're short on money and think this would be a perfect time to get some value out of Linda. Not to mention her kids, whom they claim they still own. After an extended game of hide-and-seek, Mrs. Bruce finally manages to buy Linda free. Linda is happy, but not that happy. She'd really prefer not to be bought and sold at all. Aunt Martha lives long enough to know that Linda has been freed, and then dies. Uncle Phillip follows soon after. Linda is free, but she still wishes she had a home of her own for her children.", "analysis": ""}
