They are not immediately made welcome. We finally get the narrator's name, courtesy of her grandmother. It's Linda. More sadness: Linda's dad dies. You'd think she might get the day off, but instead Mrs. Flint orders her to pick flowers to decorate the house. Remember Grandma's mistress, who borrowed all that money? She dies with the debt still outstanding. Grandma goes to the guy who inherited the mistress's estate to ask for the money back, which goes about as well as you'd expect: he basically laughs in her face.", "analysis": ""}
