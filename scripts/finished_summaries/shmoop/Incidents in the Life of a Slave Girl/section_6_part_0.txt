Linda has the hots for a young, freeborn carpenter, who proposes marriage. Afraid that Dr. Flint won't let her get married, Linda asks one of Dr. Flint's female friends to intervene for her. Dr. Flint says no way, and smacks Linda around a little for good measure. Oh, and if he ever sees her with the carpenter, he'll beat them both. This is a little weird: one day, Dr. Flint slips Linda a note, asking her to move to Louisiana with him and some other slaves. Unsurprisingly, this plan never works out. Linda tries to sneak visits with the carpenter but Dr. Flint has his eye on her. Finally she tells the carpenter that he should move to the Free States and forget about her. The carpenter takes her advice, and the two never see each other again. Linda and her little brother William start plotting for freedom.", "analysis": ""}
