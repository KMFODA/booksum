Bet he's sorry he came back South now. Even after Phillip is eventually released, Dr. Flint stakes out Aunt Martha's house. Time for a new hiding place. Linda dresses up in a sailor's uniform and leaves Betty's house. A guy named Peter rows her out to the really ominously named Snaky Swamp, where Linda hides out for the night. The swamp, as you might suspect, is full of snakes. The next morning, only slightly traumatized, Linda heads to her new hiding spot.", "analysis": ""}
