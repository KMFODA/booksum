She really does her research, asking her friend Peter for a New York newspaper to get the names of New York streets. Using the paper, Linda writes two letters, one to Dr. Flint and one to Aunt Martha. She claims that she lives in Boston but often visits New York. A sailor friend of Peter's takes the letters to New York and mails them back to Edenton. Dr. Flint falls for the trick. He writes to the mayor of Boston to ask if he has seen anyone who meets Linda's description. Since obviously the mayor of Boston has nothing more important to do than wander the streets looking for an escaped slave. Since the trick seems to have worked, Aunt Martha allows Linda out of the crawlspace every once in a while. Linda worries that she's going to be permanently crippled from her teeny living quarters.", "analysis": ""}
