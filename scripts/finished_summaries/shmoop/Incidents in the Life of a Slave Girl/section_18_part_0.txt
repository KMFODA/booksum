Dr. Flint returns from New York empty-handed. Well, duh, she's hiding right down the road. Mr. Sands sends an agent to buy Linda's children and her brother. Eventually, Dr. Flint agrees--but only because he doesn't know who he's really selling to. Mr. Sands now owns Ellen, Benny, and William, who are all really stoked.
