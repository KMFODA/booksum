Like: The waiters won't give her tea when she's eating with Mrs. Bruce. She's not allowed to sit in a chair and hold the child on her lap, but has to place the child in the chair and stand behind her. The servants won't bring her dinner to her room when Mrs. Bruce asks them to, so she has to go down to the kitchen to get it herself. Finally, Linda puts her foot down and says that Mrs. Bruce is paying for her just like any of the white servants, so she'd better be treated like one of them. This actually works. See, Linda says, you've just got to stand up for your rights.", "analysis": ""}
