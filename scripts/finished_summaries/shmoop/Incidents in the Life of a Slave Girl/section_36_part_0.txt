This is really sad for Linda, and a little nerve-wracking for us. What's Linda going to do now? Luckily, Mr. Bruce keeps her on as a nurse for little Mary. They all travel to England, so Mary can be with her relatives. Linda notices that the English poor are oppressed, but they're still better off than American slaves. They've got homes, access to education, and legal protection. Linda stays in England for ten months and never encounters racial prejudice.", "analysis": ""}
