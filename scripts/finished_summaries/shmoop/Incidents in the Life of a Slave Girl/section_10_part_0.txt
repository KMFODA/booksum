One day, Dr. Flint shows up and demands to know the race of the baby's father. When he learns that he is a white man, Dr. Flint demands that Linda cut off ties with the guy. Plus, her plan has failed, since Dr. Flint is never going to sell her. Linda gets another visitor: Uncle Phillip, who's just back from a trip. After Linda gets really sick, her baby is born early. They're both in bad shape, and Linda is stuck in bed for an entire year. Luckily, they both pull through. Somehow, Dr. Flint still has the hots for Linda, and he gets William to pass her notes. This doesn't prevent him from throwing William in jail when he's late to work one day. At one year old, Linda's baby gets really sick. Linda prays for him to survive, even though she's pretty sure death is better than slavery.", "analysis": ""}
