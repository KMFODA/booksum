Messengers keep trying to convince them to help Talbot, and each says he can't and blames the other. We find out that Talbot's son has come out to help his father, and they may die together if York and Somerset don't find a way to help. One of the messengers, Sir William Lucy, says the feud between Somerset and York is betraying the memory of Henry V, because it's causing the English to lose what he won. Somerset finally says he'll send some horsemen, but Sir William Lucy fears it will be too late, since they will take six hours to get there. Lucy tells Somerset if Talbot is dead \"His fame lives in the world, his shame in you\" , likely meaning that Talbot's courage will be remembered, but that Talbot would have been ashamed of Somerset's behavior.", "analysis": ""}
