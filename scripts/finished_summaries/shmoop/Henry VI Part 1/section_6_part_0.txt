{"name": "Act 2, Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219164758/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/henry-vi-part-1/summary/act-2-scene-2", "summary": "Talbot, Bedford, and Burgundy come in. Bedford decides to give the French a break and stop chasing them for now. Talbot says he has revenged Salisbury, in no uncertain terms: \"For every drop of blood was drawn from him / There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight\" . Talbot plans to build a tomb to Salisbury right in France, celebrating Salisbury's courage and rubbing it in for the French. Talbot notes that they didn't see the Dauphin, Joan of Arc, or the Dauphin's chief men in the battle. Bedford says it's thought they leapt over the walls and hid in a field. Burgundy says he thinks he frightened the Dauphin and Jean. He's in little doubt that they're lovers--in fact, he describes Jean as a prostitute, or \"trull\" . This looks pretty bad for Charles's military reputation, in the view of the play's audience. Fun fact: The period wasn't so strong on the make love, not war theory of life. A messenger turns up and asks Talbot to pay a visit to \"the virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne\" . Burgundy thinks that the chivalrous thing to do is to go and Talbot agrees then heads out to see her.", "analysis": ""}
