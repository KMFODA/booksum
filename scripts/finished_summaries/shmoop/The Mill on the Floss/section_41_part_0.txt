She is too excited to sleep. She heard some great music that night and her encounters with Stephen are leaving her on edge. The narrator explains how important music is for Maggie and how she hasn't had much of it in her life for the past two years. She's basically like a starving person who has gotten dropped off at an all-you-can-eat buffet now. Lucy comes in and they girls talk a bit. They discuss music and Lucy asks for Maggie's opinion of Stephen. Maggie says that she likes Stephen find and encourages Lucy to tease him more often since he is a bit full of it. Maggie then explains the story with Philip to Lucy. She feels unburdened. Lucy finds the whole story really tragic and romantic - she's convinced that Philip and Maggie are star-crossed lovers now and tells Maggie that she'll help her out. Lucy wants Maggie to marry Philip and spend all her time with Lucy and Stephen. They can all double date and play the piano together and sing songs. Maggie shivers suddenly. Lucy assumes she's cold and leaves her to go to sleep. The narrator hints that Lucy is going to be guided by her assumptions regarding Maggie and Philip as soulmates in the future. This is also one of many hints we've gotten that Maggie isn't quite sure about her relationship with Philip.", "analysis": ""}
