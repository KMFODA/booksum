Maggie is stuck manning a popular booth, which doesn't make her happy. She'd rather be somewhere less conspicuous. Stephen hangs out at Lucy's booth and she scolds him for ignoring Maggie. Mr. Wakem then goes over to Maggie's booth and is very polite to her. Maggie is confused by his behavior. Stephen then comes to see how she's doing after Mr. Wakem leaves. Meanwhile, Philip is lurking in a corner watching them. Stephen sees him and goes over to confront him. The two get into a passive-aggressive argument. Stephen then leaves Philip and goes to the town library to sulk. Maggie is still at her booth, having yet another internal crisis. Dr. Kenn sees her and notices she looks distraught. He goes up to talk to her. He asks if she'll be in town long and Maggie says no rather abruptly. Dr. Kenn leaves and Maggie goes back to pondering Philip and Stephen. Later that night, Lucy and Maggie are talking and Maggie tells her that she is going away soon to start a new governess position. Lucy is upset that Maggie hadn't told her earlier and can't understand why Maggie is leaving Philip. Maggie explains that Tom would never let her marry Philip and she can't break off relations with her brother. Lucy thinks Tom is being ridiculous. Maggie assures Lucy that she'd marry Philip if it weren't for Tom, and Lucy believes her.", "analysis": ""}
