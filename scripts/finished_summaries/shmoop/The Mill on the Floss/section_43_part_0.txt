Tom has been going on business trips and is doing really well. Mr. Deane gives another one of his patented 'back in my day, sonny, I walked 50 miles in the snow everywhere' type of speeches. This time he talks about how the world is changing. We learn that Tom has been working for Mr. Deane for seven years and that he is now twenty-three. Mr. Deane gives a very rambling run-down of the business and how Tom has been excelling. After a while, he finally gets to the point: Mr. Guest and Mr. Deane want to promote Tom and give him a share in the business. So Tom will basically have stock in the company now. Tom is happy about this. But Tom has something to ask Mr. Deane: he wants his help to buy back the mill. He explains it was his father's dying wish and that there's an opportunity to get it now since Wakem's current manager is no good and Wakem might just want to get rid of the place now. Mr. Deane is intrigued and says he'll think about it, but notes that he'd rather keep Tom in his current position rather than make him a Mill manager right now. Tom says he could do both since he loves work. Mr. Deane finds this a bit depressing and tells Tom that he'll get married one day and have other things to worry about.", "analysis": ""}
