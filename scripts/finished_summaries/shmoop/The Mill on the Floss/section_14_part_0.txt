But Tom notices that something seems a little off. Turns out that Mr. Tulliver is in a terrible mood. Some man in the neighborhood, a Mr. Privart, is trying some new irrigation techniques and it's interfering with Tulliver's Mill, which runs on water power. This new guy is also a client of Mr. Wakem, the evil lawyer. Mr. Tulliver keeps ranting and Mr. and Mrs. Moss are confused by the whole thing. Mr. Tulliver announces that he'll make Tom an engineer so that he can figure out this irrigation business. Tom is rather alarmed by that announcement. He thought he'd run a mill just like his dad. Mrs. Moss and Mrs. Tulliver agree that getting involved in lawsuits is a bad idea and they hope Mr. Tulliver won't do it. , which is all about a legal case over a disputed will that lasts for decades.) We learn that Mr. Tulliver has a history of getting involved in lawsuits and legal disputes. Mr. Tulliver's own lawyer, Mr. Gore, isn't really the best of lawyers. He actually sounds a bit like Barry, the world's worst lawyer, from Arrested Development. Mr. Wakem is unfortunately a superstar lawyer, albeit an evil one. At the end of his holidays Tom tells his dad that he heard a rumor: apparently Mr. Wakem is sending his son to study with Mr. Stelling. Mr. Tulliver says it's true and tells Tom to be nice to the son since he's deformed. He says that Mr. Wakem obviously thinks Mr. Stelling is a good teacher, so it's all cool really. Tom is not looking forward to meeting a deformed Wakem.", "analysis": ""}
