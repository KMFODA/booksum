In terms of human wrath, no one compares to Mother Mary. She's Jimmie, Maggie, and Tommie's mom, as well as a raging alcoholic abuser who careens around the apartment and busts up furniture just to make a point. Nothing makes her more abusive than her son's relentless habit of getting into fights, though, and today she comes out swinging. Oh, and Dad's an alcoholic, too, but he likes to seek respite by doing his drinking at a local bar. Jimmie receives some sympathy from a neighbor.", "analysis": ""}
