He now comes to Bulstrodes house and insists on staying overnight. The desperate Bulstrode gives him an ultimatum next morning that future demands should be made by letter. He says if Raffles comes there in prison he will report him to the police and take the consequences. His sternness convinces Raffles and he leaves with a hundred pounds. Bulstrode is aware that the matter has not ended. After this he tries to get his affair in order before leaving. He requests Caleb Garth to take charge of Stone Court. Caleb suggests leasing out Stone Court and taking a share of the proceeds. Bulstrode asks him to arrange it. Caleb has the pleasant thought of arranging for Fred to take the lease of Stone Court. Bulstrode agrees to it partly because his wife feels he hasnt helped her relatives. Only Susan urges Caleb to be silent until it has all been arranged.", "analysis": "Notes Bulstrodes increasing desperation and fear of exposure makes him give up all the activities and the position he holds dear. He is afraid of losing his familys good opinion as well as that of the town. While his situation is on a downslide, Calebs condition is improving. He is eager to share good fortune and help Fred. This assignment is a valuable one for Caleb and his rising star underlines the novelists stress on the work ethic. The ultimate value of work, and the insecure rewards to easy money is one of the novels Themes."}
