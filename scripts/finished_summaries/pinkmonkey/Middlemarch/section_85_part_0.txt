{"name": "Chapter 86", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820035130/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmMiddle99.asp", "summary": "Caleb Garth accepts Mrs. Bulstrodes proposal. He goes home to break the good news to Mary. There is an affectionate interlude where he teases her about Freds worth and wants to be sure she loves him. Mary cheerfully asserts that she loves him only \"because I have always loved him. I should never like scolding any one else so well.\" She receives his news with joy, then goes on to torment Fred before giving him the news. The two lovers are filled with joy.", "analysis": "Notes The truly happy ending the novel allows only to Fred and Mary. They carry on the tradition of Caleb Garth, and the ethic, which George Eliot obviously admires: simplicity, modesty, and a love of hard work for its own sake. Freds earlier parasitic nature is reclaimed by Caleb and Mary, almost like a piece of land, and proves to be fruitful. To dilute the heavy moralistic flavor, the author handles their story with humor."}
