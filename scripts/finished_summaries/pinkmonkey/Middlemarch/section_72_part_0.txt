The gulf between the noble tasks he had imagined for himself and the sordid \"swamp\" he is trapped in almost breaks him down. He is tortured by doubts. Even if Bulstrode had given him the money to silence him about Raffles disclosures. Even if he disobeyed Lydgates orders, it could be a mistaken continuation of the older form of treatment, which liberally gave alcohol to the patient.
