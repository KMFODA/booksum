{"name": "Chapter 67", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820035130/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmMiddle80.asp", "summary": "Lydgate is lucky to lose at billiards as that brings him to his senses so far as betting goes. He now has little alternative other than a personal loan. Rosamond tells him her father has already refused and suggested Bulstrode as another source. Lydgate hesitates to involve himself with the pious banker, an association that has already brought him some hostility. Since his work at the new hospital is unpaid and very time-consuming, he feels he could properly approach Bulstrode. The opportunity comes when the banker asks for his medical services, one day. Lydgate finds nothing seriously wrong except stress and tiredness. Then Bulstrode breaks the news that he wishes to make further contribution to the new hospital. He proposes an amalgamation of the old and new hospitals, so donations can be dispersed to either. He also says Dorothea is a likely major donor to the project in his place. Feeling downhearted at the failure of his one successful project, Lydgate finally asks for the loan of one thousand pounds. Bulstrode rebuffs him instantly, saying he had foreseen this when Lydgate married one of the extravagant Vincys, and advises him to go in for bankruptcy proceeding. Lydgate leaves, but his pride bitterly hurt.", "analysis": "Notes Lydgate is shown in a situation where every door is shut in his face. But unlike Will Ladislaw, his family burden prevents him from making a drastic change in his life-style. The situation also makes the reader anticipate a fresh contact with Dorothea as benefactor. Bulstrode is obviously laboring under the pressure of blackmail both financially and morally."}
