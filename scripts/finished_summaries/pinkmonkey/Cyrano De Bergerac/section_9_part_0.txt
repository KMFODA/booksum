{"name": "Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820053313/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmCyrano22.asp", "summary": "This scene opens with Cyrano's arrival at the bakery for his meeting with Roxane. Upon his entry, Ragueneau is distracted from the paper bags covered with verse. He praises Cyrano for his duel that was fought while composing a ballad. Cyrano asks Ragueneau to let him use the shop as a private meeting place. The baker agrees to the plan reluctantly, for it is the hour when his poets usually arrive. While waiting nervously for Roxane, Cyrano writes a love letter to give to Roxane, while Lise entertains a musketeer who has entered the shop.", "analysis": "Notes In this scene, the kindness and generosity of Ragueneau are highlighted. Cyrano arrives at his bakery and asks Ragueneau if he can use the shop as a private meeting place. The baker agrees even though it means he will not be able to enjoy the company of the poets during the entire morning. It is clear that poetry is an obsession for Ragueneau. Not only does he try to compose verse himself, he truly enjoys hearing the verse of others. He particularly praises Cyrano for reciting an original ballad while fighting a duel with Valvert."}
