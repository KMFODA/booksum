{"name": "Scene 8", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820053313/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmCyrano32.asp", "summary": "The monk is looking for Roxane's house, but Cyrano coolly and cleverly misdirects him. The monk blesses Cyrano and goes merrily on his way. Christian reminds Cyrano to ask Roxane for a kiss once again. Although the audience realizes that the embrace will be painful for Cyrano, he sees the inevitability of these two attractive young people coming together. He also knows that his words have made their coming together a reality.", "analysis": "Notes The Capuchin monk being misdirected and then blessing Cyrano for his guidance is a light, humorous moment in the play. The moment is spoiled with Christian's insistence on receiving a kiss from Roxane. He instructs Cyrano that he needs to again speak in the voice of Christian and ask Roxane for the embrace one more time. Cyrano's resigned tone and his checked hope are both aimed at making the audience sympathize with Cyrano, who is the more deserving person."}
