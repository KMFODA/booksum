{"name": "Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820053313/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmCyrano29.asp", "summary": "Count De Guiche has come to bid farewell to Roxane, for he has been made a Colonel of the Guards and is to take part in the siege of Arras. Since the Guards include the regimental company of the Cadets, which include both Christian and Cyrano, Roxane tricks De Guiche. She talks him into taking revenge on Cyrano by depriving him and his regiment of the chance of heroism in war. De Guiche, not realizing he has been tricked, agrees to keep the Cadets in Paris. Roxane also quizzes De Guiche about Christian. He responds that the young man, who is handsome but stupid, has become inseparable from Cyrano. Feeling that Roxane may have an interest in him, De Guiche suggests that he also stay behind, concealed in the monastery of the Capuchins. Roxane dissuades him by saying that she could only love a man who welcomed danger. She tells him he should prove his heroism to her by fighting in the war. After De Guiche departs, Roxane warns her governess not to tell Cyrano that she has deprived him of a chance to prove himself at Arras. She then calls Cyrano out from his hiding place inside the house.", "analysis": "Notes The power of Roxane to manipulate De Guiche proves to the audience that she is more than an intellectually affected woman. When she learns that Christian and Cyrano will be sent off to Arras along with De Guiche, she uses Cyrano as an excuse to keep Christian and the other Cadets out of the fighting. Then when De Guiche suggests that he stay behind as well, Roxane flirts with him in order to ensure his departure. She tells him she could only love a man who is not afraid to prove his bravery and encourages De Guiche to be heroic."}
