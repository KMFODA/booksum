{"name": "Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820053313/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmCyrano21.asp", "summary": "Two children enter the pastry shop and purchase some pastries. Ragueneau is reluctant to pack them in the bags with poetry on them, but Lise insists. While she is occupied elsewhere, he calls the children back and offers them free pastries in exchange for the bag with a poem on it. The children agree to the bargain.", "analysis": "Notes In this short scene, the character of Ragueneau is further developed. He is crushed when his practical wife insists that he wrap the pastries purchased by two children with the sheets of poetry. Since Lise is the strong, domineering one in the family, he reluctantly follows her orders. However, as soon as she is out of sight, Ragueneau calls the children back and gives them free pastries in exchange for the sheets of poetry. The fact that Rostand devotes two scenes at the beginning of Act II to Ragueneau is significant. He will become a constant character in the play, appearing and re-appearing, as he tries to befriend Cyrano, whom he greatly admires. His pastry shop is also important, for it is the meeting place of poets; more importantly, it is the place where Roxane and Cyrano are to meet."}
