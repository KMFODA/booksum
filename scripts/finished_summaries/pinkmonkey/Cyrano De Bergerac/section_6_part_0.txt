He wishes to prove his worth to her by showing his valor. Two gentlemen, Cuigy and Brissaille, enter with the drunken Ligniere, who declares that a hundred men are waiting to attack him. Cyrano offers to offer him protection, by escorting him with a troop of officers. He declares, however, that he will find the attackers alone and unaided. As they prepare to leave, several others join the group, wishing to witness what happens at the Porte de Nesle. When they depart, Cyrano is proudly at the head of the group. He pauses to say that it was necessary to send one hundred men to kill Ligniere because everyone knows he is a friend of his, implying that everyone fears Cyrano.", "analysis": "Notes Scene 7 shows how love spurs men to heroic deeds. Cyrano feels that if he is ever to win Roxane's love, he must convince her that he is brave and valorous. As a result, when Ligniere enters and tells him about the one hundred men who are waiting to attack him, Cyrano, a good swordsman, offers to fight them single- handedly. It will be his opportunity to prove his worth to Roxane. The scene is filled with humor as Cyrano goes forth with excessive show to bravely defend Ligniere in an effort to win the love of Roxane. The scene also ends on a note of suspense. The audience wonders if Cyrano will be successful in defending Ligniere against an attack by one hundred men; they also wonder what Roxane wants to say to him the next morning."}
