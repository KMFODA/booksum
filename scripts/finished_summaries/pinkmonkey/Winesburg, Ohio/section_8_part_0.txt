But later in her own room, she weeps bitterly, and resolves to live a life, learning to live alone and die alone, in Winesburg.", "analysis": "Notes This story of Alice is deep in pathos and guilt complexes. The reader is given a picture of the desolate life of Alice and her unrequited love for Ned Currie. Ned's behavior pattern cannot be totally considered immoral. His relation with Alice has been superficial; a young man's needs being fulfilled. Of course, on hearing Alice's desire to join him at the city, does touch chord in him. \" He had wanted the girl to become his mistress but changed his mind. He wanted to protect and care for her.\" This care and affection however doesn't last long and it is not surprising that he forgets about her very soon. This lack of concern is all the more pathetic when we see Alice, loving him more and willing to spend her entire life waiting for him. It is probably Alice's deep-rooted guilt complex about her behavior with Ned that has led her to remain faithful to him. Yet her fervent wish for something to happen in her life, is understandable. Arranging a blanket to look like a form lying beside her bed speaks of her unquenched desires and her need for some form of love and affection. This need takes a turn for the worse, when she runs naked through the streets, and is ready to bed anyone, so that her desires are fulfilled. This Freudian lapse in her behavior speaks for itself. Simultaneously getting wet, in the rain, naked, can be understood as a Baptismal purifying process, a need to cleanse herself from her past and Ned, and begin anew, a life of her own. Yet, here again, her passive nature stops her. But the story ends, with her trying to force herself to face her life bravely, and even to face the idea of dying, all alone, bravely.
