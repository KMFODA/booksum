He leaves Winesburg still a drunkard, but he brings about a strange change in the life of a five-year-old child. The child's father has been shown as a hollow, shallow man, who talks of God and religion but doesn't care for his own child.

He knows that this girl cannot now at this point of time, come in his life as a woman, but he pleads with her to dare to be strong and courageous \"be something more than man or woman.\" His words are like a blessing for the young girl. The stranger's conception of love is not just the one between man and woman. It is universal. For him, Tandy represents salvation, an absolution from his sins. Tandy too in her innocence of age, has comprehended the stranger's words. Therefore, when her ignorant father calls her by her own name, she insists on being called Tandy.
