The vampire is much stronger than they are. He is more cunning than any mortal with the strength of twenty men is. He is ageless. His shrewd acumen has been honed over the ages. He can take any form and is a devil at heart. He can command the rat, owl, wolves, or any animal. They cannot possibly vanquish him, as they are merely men. This is the question, which is persisting in their minds."}
