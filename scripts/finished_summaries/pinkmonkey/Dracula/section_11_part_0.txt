{"name": "Chapter 12", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820041120/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmDracula19.asp", "summary": "Dr. Seward's diary continues to note that, on 18 th of September, Van Helsing and Dr. Seward rush up to find Mrs. Westenra dead, and Lucy barely alive. The maids have all fainted. Quincey Morris enters and he gives blood to her. Arthur is informed about Mrs. Westenras death for the first time. Van Helsing tells Dr. Seward about his suspicion of vampires. On 19 th of September, Lucy is examined; her teeth look unnaturally sharp. Mina Harker sends a letter to Lucy, which is unopened by her, telling her about Jonathan and her. A report from Patrick Hennesey is added about Renfield, who has run away twice to the house next door crying, \"Ill fight for my lord and master.\" Lucy is dying, but this time Van Helsing does not allow Arthur to kiss her.", "analysis": "Notes This chapter is very somber in tone. Lucy is dead and all the men who had loved her are at her bedside. Renfield keeps on running to the house next door, which should have pointed out something suspicious, at least, to Dr. Seward, who is keeping him under minute observation. Yet he fails to be suspicious. This is his second mistake."}
