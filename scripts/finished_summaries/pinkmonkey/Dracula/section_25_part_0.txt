On 29 th of October, he writes this note on the train from Varna to Galats. Mina is hypnotized again and reveals that the Count has reached. However, she is changing so he becomes sullen and refuses to speak. The captain of the ship reveals to Jonathan that there was trouble on the ship because of the boxes. A letter of instructions has been sent to Emmanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the boxes before sunrise, which was to be collected by Petrof Skinsky. But the men have lost the trail of Skinsky. Mina surmises that the Count has decided to get back to his castle by water through a secret way. He has also murdered Skinsky. To erase the trail, they all plan to meet by separate way at Transylvania at Draculas castle.", "analysis": "Notes Dracula senses that the band is following him. If they can hypnotize Mina and sense where Dracula is, Dracula can read her mind on the basis of their blood kinship. Mina may be under the influence of Dracula yet she is still well poised to plot out a detailed list of his movement, which is very adroitly done. In fact, beside Van Helsing, Mina is the only one who can be considered an able tactician. In this chapter, Dracula has again become a better plotter than the men have, as he has managed to erase his trail."}
