{"name": "Chapter 9", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820041120/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmDracula16.asp", "summary": "This chapter is again a series of letters. The first is from Mina to Lucy, who writes on 24th August from Budapest. She tells about an ailing Jonathan who tells of a terrible tale. He hands his diary to Mina who keeps it carefully. They get married in the hospital itself. Lucy writes back and congratulates Mina and tells about her own marriage to Arthur, which is slated for 28th August. In the meantime, Dr. Seward observes Renfield keenly; who looses interest in animals. A big bat is seemingly watching. Lucy records in her diary that she is very unwell and cant sleep too well. Arthur writes to Dr. Seward to see Lucy. Arthur is summoned home for his father is unwell. Dr. Seward writes to Arthur that Lucy is indeed unwell as she is almost bloodless and he is calling his professor and mentor Abraham Van Helsing. The Professor has seen Lucy. He is very troubled and rushes to Amsterdam. Renfield again starts eating flies and is brooding. Later he tries to run away. On September 6, Dr. Seward urgently summons Professor Van Helsing.", "analysis": "Notes This chapter now takes a serious turn with Lucy falling very sick. Dracula, so it is revealed has sucked her almost bloodless. Renfield too suffers in his own way. Dr. Seward, as some critics point out, is seen to be very cruel in his treatment of Renfield, as he experiments, on Renfield almost like a guinea pig. There, Mina and Jonathan have been reunited. The traumatic early escapades with Dracula have rendered Jonathan unconfident and unsure. He feels he is suffering from something terrible. Jonathan, it should be noted, is the only one amongst Draculas victims to escape almost scot-free. The next few chapters draw all the brave men together. All the characters among the men have been already introduced."}
