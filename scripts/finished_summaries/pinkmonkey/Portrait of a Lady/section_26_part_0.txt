One day, Isabel sits down to rest alone and is met by Lord Warburton, just returned from a six month journey to the east. His looks very handsome and English. He tells her he has written to her many times but has never sent the letters. He tells her he cant stop thinking of her. He promises to leave the matter to rest, but it is clear he wishes he could continue to press his case with her. He will be in Rome for a week or so. Isabel feels it is awkward to have Lord Warburton in Rome, but theres nothing to be done about it. One day, they go to Saint Peters and just as she is walking with Lord Warburton, she turns around to find Gilbert Osmond. He tells her he came to be with her and she blushes, worrying Lord Warburton will have heard this. Ralph and the others come out of the church and join them. Then Ralph and Lord Warburton walk off together and discuss the possibility of Isabel falling in love with Gilbert Osmond. Ralph says Isabel wants nothing either of the two of them can give her.", "analysis": "Notes Chapter 27, the last chapter of Volume I, brings all the satellite figures together around Isabel Archer.
