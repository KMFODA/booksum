She tells Amelia that she was treated with contempt and compelled to teach French at the mall and that she was glad to bid it goodbye. Amelia, excitedly, shows Becky around her house and gifts her a Cashmere shawl , besides a lot of other things. The knowledge that Amelias brother, Joseph Sedley is rich and unmarried fills hope into Beckys heart and she is determined to make an attempt to woo him.", "analysis": "Notes The narrator establishes the character of Becky Sharp, in this part. Evident from her name , Becky is seen to be wicked, selfish, pretentious, self assertive and rude. Her large green eyes symbolize her envious nature. She regards it a great wrong towards her, that ladies less intelligent and less accomplished than her should have every comfort in life. She was the daughter of a poor artist who gave lessons at Miss Pinkertons academy. After his death, Becky was to stay at the academy and teach French, which she had well acquired from her mother. When Becky finally gets to Chiswick Mall, she is disgusted with the manner in which she is treated. Everybody, besides Amelia, look down upon her and Becky returns their dislike with even more dislike. Becky Sharp, at this point, seems to be the victim of societys prejudice. Nobody wishes to befriend her because she comes from a poor origin. She is insulted, ridiculed, hated, and treated like a servant by the other ladies, including Miss Pinkerton. This ill treatment makes Becky hunger after respectability and she is ready to give all she has to achieve it. That is why the information of Jos Sedley being single is viewed as a wonderful opportunity to stretch out for it. Though the word campaign in the title of the chapter seems to be martial, it is actually marital."}
