{"name": "Chapter 40", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051943/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmLordJim49.asp", "summary": "Brown is eager to meet Jim and wants to learn how Jim has won the confidence of the natives. His plan is to learn Jim's strategy from him, kill him, and make himself the lord of Patusan. The double-dealing of Kassim and Cornelius gives him ample time for planing. He decides to terrorize the natives with violence and begins by having a Patusan man shot to death for no reason. Kassim witnesses the killing and sends word to Dain Waris to warn him about Brown. He also sends messages to the fort, requesting gun powder for Raja's men. Brown knows that he and his men are totally outnumbered, and escape seems impossible. One of his men is shot when he tries to go into town. Immediately there is firing from both sides. Brown orders his men to stop fighting. Later that night Brown hears the sound of yelling and shouting from the village. Cornelius tells him that the natives are welcoming Jim home. Cornelius also says that Jim, whom he calls a fool, will soon come to meet Brown.", "analysis": "Notes In this chapter, Cornelius describes Jim. He feels that Jim's honesty and fair dealings are signs of weakness and stupidity. He calls Jim a fool and tells Brown that the naive leader will soon come to call on Brown, trying to make peace. Brown is also described and shown in greater detail and he becomes a totally despicable character. As he waits for Jim to return, he has a native murdered for no reason; Brown just likes to spread terror wherever he goes. His plan is to learn what he can from Jim and then dispose of him. He will then make himself ruler of Patusan and squeeze the island of its wealth."}
