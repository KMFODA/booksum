{"name": "Chapter 30", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051943/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmLordJim39.asp", "summary": "When Jim saw Jewel being ill treated by Cornelius, he felt like thrashing Cornelius. Cornelius was also planning to kill Jim with the help of assassins. Jewel knew about the threats on Jim's life and watched over him constantly.", "analysis": "Notes The flashback in this chapter again confuses the chronological telling of the story. The first part of the chapter describes the brutalities of Cornelius. His inhuman behavior towards his stepdaughter makes him totally detestable. Jim sympathizes with Jewel fully and wants to save her. Jewel also wants to save Jim from the threats being made on his life."}
