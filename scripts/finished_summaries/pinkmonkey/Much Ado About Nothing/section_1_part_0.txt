{"name": "Scene 2", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820035130/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmMuchado10.asp", "summary": "Leonato and his brother Antonio plan the masquerade ball for this evening. One of Antonio's servants has overheard and misinterpreted the conversation between Don Pedro and Claudio about courting Hero. The servant wrongly concludes that Don Pedro wants to woo Hero for himself. Leonato decides to prepare his daughter for this proposal.", "analysis": "Notes One of Antonio's servants has overheard a conversation between Don Pedro and Claudio and has wrongly concluded that Don Pedro wishes to woo and win Hero as a wife for himself. However, the fact is that Don Pedro is going to woo Hero on behalf of Claudio and win her as a wife for Claudio. As will happen many times in the course of this play, characters observe scenes and misinterpret the meanings of these scenes. The plot is now firmly laid: Claudio wishes to marry Hero with Leonato's permission. This scene is rather odd, in that the misunderstanding is never fully used or effective. However, the scene does provide the basis for an upcoming plot against the romantic couple and also reinforces some characterization. Though Leonato questions the servant's sharpness, he should have double-checked the veracity of his information before proceeding to act upon it. This incident forewarns the readers of his Leonato's gullible nature, and also of Antonio's credibility. Otherwise, it is not an important scene."}
