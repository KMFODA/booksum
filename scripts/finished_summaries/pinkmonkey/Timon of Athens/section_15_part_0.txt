{"name": "Scene 3", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820050202/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmTimon27.asp", "summary": "A soldier looks for Timon in the woods. He is able to locate the place by its description. He however does not find Timon. His eyes fall on an inscription, which Timon has left behind. The soldier also sees the grave and is sure Timon is dead. Something is written on the tomb, which he cannot read. He decides to take the impression with wax and shows it to Alcibiades the captain who is an experienced interpreter.", "analysis": "Notes The inscription on the tomb is quite misanthropic. It says that Timon has lived more that he had wished for. Timon compares man to a beast, when he says that there are no men in this world. What he means to say here is that, there is not a single individual with a sense of humanity who is fit to be called a man. The soldier is able to read only the first piece of writing. He cannot read the rest because it is written in a language unknown to him."}
