Lucullus is glad to meet Timons men, since he expects a gift from Timon. He therefore gives the servant a warm welcome and inquires on Timons health. Flaminius reports his masters condition and the need for fifty talents. Lucullus now says that many times, while dining with Timon, he had cautioned him against overspending. Lucullus then tries to bribe Flaminius, so that he tells Timon that to tell a lie that he did not find him. Flaminius refuses to be bribed and Lucullus calls him a fool.", "analysis": "Notes The third act is not surprising for the audience or the readers. This scene shows how Timons friend Lucullus reacts to his state and his request for help. Lucullus calls Timon free-hearted gentleman of Athens. Lucullus, as usual, expects gifts and wonders what lies under the servants cloak. He is disappointed to known that it is an empty box and that Timons servant has sent for. He hastily draws back saying that it is not the time to lend without security. He tries to show how concerned he was about the way Timon spent and had tried to warn him several times. But Timon would not listen to him. The cunning Lucullus therefore refuses to help Timon, whose friend he claims to be. Therefore, it is Timons generous nature that attracts friends. They take advantage of Timons behavior and the trust that he has placed on them. Timons servants seem to be loyal to his master. Flaminius is not only angry at Lucullus refusal to help but also does not accept the bribe offered to him. Although he is a mere servant he till keeps his dignity and loyalty. As he leaves he curses Lucullus, which Lucullus rightly deserves."}
