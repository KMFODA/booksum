{"name": "Act IV, Scene 4", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820040441/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmHenry4130.asp", "summary": "One of the accomplices in the rebellion is the Archbishop of York. On learning that Hotspur has been denied his fathers help and that Glendower is delayed, he becomes worried. He realizes that if Hotspur is defeated, he will be the next conspirator to be attacked by the king. Therefore, he makes hasty preparations for a defense and sends Sir Michael to his allies to inform them of the situation and ask for help.", "analysis": "Notes It may be argued that this particular scene is a bit out of place within the drama. However, Shakespeares 2 Henry IV is grounded on the main action being the fight between Henry IV and the archbishop. In addition to acting as a precursor to the action in the later play, this brief scene also suggests the direness of the rebels' situation. Sir Michael has no known historical analogue. He may be a priest or knight in the service of the Archbishop."}
