{"name": "Act III, Scene 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820040441/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmHenry4122.asp", "summary": "Hotspur, Worcester, Glendower, and Mortimer meet in Wales to finalize their plans. When Glendower remarks that the king fears him because his birth was attended by strange signs in the heavens, Hotspur, who does not believe in magic or omens, mocks him, and the two have a brief argument. Mortimer stops them and proceeds to show them a map of England with the intended division of the land after Henry is deposed. Hotspur is not satisfied with his share and further baits Glendower, who, not wanting to argue further, agrees to a minor change. Glendower, their host, exits to fetch Mortimer's and Hotspur's wives, so that the couples may say their farewells. When he is gone, Mortimer chides Hotspur for his rudeness to his father-in- law and Hotspur replies that he is sick of hearing Glendower's constant talk of magic. Mortimer defends Glendower's wisdom and bravery and warns Hotspur that he is not a man to be casually crossed. Worcester tells his nephew to control his temper and watch his manners, for although he is brave, his lack of control makes him look ill bred. Glendower returns with Lady Percy and Lady Mortimer. Lady Mortimer knows no English, and Mortimer knows no Welsh, but with Glendower acting as an interpreter, the couple express their love and longing for each other. Lady Mortimer then sings a song in Welsh. Hotspur mocks her singing to his wife and two spar playfully before he leaves to attend to business. Glendower then tells Mortimer to hurry and they, too, exit.", "analysis": ""}
