With Falstaff out of the room, his confederates prepare to betray him: Nym: I will discuss the humour of his love to Page . Pistol: And I to Ford shall eke unfold How Falstaff, varlet vile, His dove will prove, his gold will hold, And his soft couch defile.", "analysis": "Falstaff is a knight \"almost out at heels,\" and therefore, he sees as his natural prey the well-off middle class. Since he fancies himself a lover -- \"Page's wife . . . gave me good eyes too\" -- it is this talent which he will exploit to make money. The language which he uses to describe the woman whom he plans to woo is replete with references to the great age of the English merchant-adventurers: She bears the purse too. She is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will be cheaters  to them both, and they shall be exchequers to me. They shall be my East and West Indies, and I will trade to them both.  To see this \"cheater\" cheated -- that is, Falstaff -- will be one of the chief pleasures in the play, and Pistol and Nym's quick decision to betray their captain anticipates the fun."}
