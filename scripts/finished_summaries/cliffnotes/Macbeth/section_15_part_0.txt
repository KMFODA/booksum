The scene is unnecessary to understanding the play and was probably not written by Shakespeare.", "analysis": "Hecate's supernatural spite is intended to echo that of the human dimension. She is a vindictive female spirit, whose forceful instructions to the Witches reflect the language of Lady Macbeth to her husband. Although unnecessary dramatically, the scene reinforces the philosophical question: Is Macbeth entirely to blame for his own downfall? In Hecate's opinion, he is. She tells the Witches that Macbeth \"loves for his own ends\" and prophesies that Macbeth \"shall spurn Fate,\" recalling the words \"disdaining Fortune\" from Act I. Without this line of argument, it would be easier to suggest that Macbeth is powerless to control his own destiny. Glossary beldams  witches Acheron  Hell sleights  charms security  overconfidence"}
