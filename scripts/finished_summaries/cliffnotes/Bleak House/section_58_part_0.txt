Smallweed has discovered a signed will dated later than the wills already examined in the Jarndyce and Jarndyce suit. The new will reduces Mr. Jarndyce's interests considerably but advances those of Richard and Ada. Mr. Kenge, to whom the new document is given, is sure that it will carry much weight when, in a month's time, it is introduced in court.", "analysis": "Even though Esther and Mr. Jarndyce have agreed to be married the following month, Dickens has made such a strong \"case\" for Allan Woodcourt that we suspect that some development yet to come will make it possible for Allan to triumph. The newly discovered Jarndyce will intensifies our interest in the court case."}
