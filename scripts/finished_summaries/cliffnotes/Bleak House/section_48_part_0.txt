On that day, the pompous, wordy Vholes relentlessly pursues the theme that Richard needs money . Learning finally that Richard lives next door, upstairs, Allan visits him and finds the young man haggard and dejected -- he has made no progress with his interests in the Chancery suit -- but quite agreeable to receive advice and direction from Allan. When Esther suggests to Ada that they visit Richard, Ada is at first hesitant and acts strangely: she has \"tears in her eyes and love in her face.\" When they do visit Richard, Ada reveals that she has been his wife for two months and will not be returning to Bleak House. Esther reveals the marriage to Mr. Jarndyce, and he accepts it calmly, but pities the two and twice remarks that \"Bleak House is thinning fast.\" As soon as Allan Woodcourt arrived in London, he went to Mr. Vholes to get Richard's address.

The marriage of Ada and Richard in such unpropitious circumstances darkens the story's atmosphere further, as it now seems inevitable that Richard's ominous future will also be Ada's."}
