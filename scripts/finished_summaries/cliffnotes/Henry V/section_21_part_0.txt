There is much confusion on the battlefield, but they continue fighting, declaring their utter shame, realizing that in mere numbers, \"We are enough yet living in the field / To smother up the English.\"", "analysis": "This short scene is the second one dealing with the battle itself. It shows that the French are indeed being dispersed in spite of their great number. As is obvious, the main intent of the scene is to show the shame of the once boastful and arrogant French as they are being defeated by those \"wretches that we played at dice for.\" The entire day, then, is nothing but \"shame, and eternal shame, nothing but shame!\""}
