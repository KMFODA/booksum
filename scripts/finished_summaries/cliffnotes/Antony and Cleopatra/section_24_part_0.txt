He then calls for a meal to be served, and he compliments his servants for their loyalty. He speaks as if this is the last night they will serve him, and before long they are all weeping: even the hardened old Enobarbus is \"onion-eyed\" and begs Antony not to give them such discomfort, and Antony responds by laughing. He did not mean to be taken seriously, he says, and he assures those present that he expects victory -- not defeat.", "analysis": "Antony reveals two interesting character traits here: bravado and sentimentality. At their best, these qualities give Antony great courage and a generous and forgiving nature, but at their worst they become sentimental pap, which Enobarbus is quick to point out."}
