During those years, Leontes has replaced his jealousy with seclusion, while Florizel and Perdita have grown up and matured in Bohemia.", "analysis": "As in ancient Greek plays, a Chorus substitutes narrative for dramatic action. In addition to preparing the audience for an adult Florizel and Perdita, when next we see them, the narrative transcends the focus from the actions of Leontes to the actions of the Bohemian cast of characters."}
