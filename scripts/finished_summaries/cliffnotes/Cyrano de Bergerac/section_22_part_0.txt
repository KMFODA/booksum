{"name": "Act V -- Scene 1", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219142306/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/c/cyrano-de-bergerac/summary-and-analysis/act-v-8212-scene-1", "summary": "The final act takes place in the courtyard of a convent. The sisters are awaiting Cyrano's arrival. We learn that he is poor, often hungry, and that he visits Roxane, who took refuge here after Christian's death, every Saturday.", "analysis": "This subdued scene, which takes place more than 14 years after the incidents that closed Act IV, gives the audience an opportunity to become accustomed to the setting and to learn the situation. As noted elsewhere, this is a characteristic quality of the scenes that open the various acts of the play. The nuns explain the situation as it has existed for nearly 15 years. They also give a clear and very endearing picture of Cyrano's visits to Roxane, who is still grieving for Christian. The nuns love Cyrano and enjoy telling him their little peccadilloes and being teased by him. They know that, while he may not be a good Catholic , he is the best and noblest of men. He takes it upon himself to bring a smile to Roxane's face. Cyrano is a ray of sunshine in her life and in the lives of the nuns. He hides his poverty with his pride, his wit, and his charm."}
