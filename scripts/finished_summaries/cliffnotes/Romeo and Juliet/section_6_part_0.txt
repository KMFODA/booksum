The Prologue does little to enhance the story and is often omitted when the play is performed. Many critics feel that a different author added the Prologue at some point after the play was originally written. Nonetheless, this introductory material serves to distinguish between Romeo's cold, miserable, unrequited love for Rosaline and his true, intensely mutual love with Juliet. Unlike the first Prologue, this one speaks less of fate; rather, it helps to build suspense. \"But passion lends them power, time means, to meet / Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.\" Romeo and Juliet forge onward in pursuit of their love -- empowered to dare cross thresholds that have before been barriers.
