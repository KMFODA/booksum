A map of medieval Britain, such as the one found in the Riverside Shakespeare edition of Shakespeare's plays, can be very helpful in keeping track of the places and movements in Richard II, although it is by no means necessary in order to understand the play. For those who are interested, the important place names and basic trajectories of motion which occur across the course of the play are listed below. The King's Court is in the capital city of London, which is located in the southeast part of England. Westminster Hall is in London . Near the city of London is Windsor Castle, where King Richard and his allies spend time at the beginning of the play, and where Bolingbroke resides in Act V, after he becomes king. Plashy, the home of the Duchess of Gloucester, is also near London; so is Langley, the residence of the Duke of York . When Bushy and Greene flee from Windsor Castle in Act II, scene ii, they go to Bristol Castle, which is far to the west of London, in Wiltshire. Not far from this is Berkeley Castle, situated in \"Cotshall\" , somewhat northwest of Bristol. This is why Bolingbroke can so easily find and capture Bushy and Greene after he reaches Berkeley Castle in Act II, scene iii. Bolingbroke's invading force, as we hear from Northumberland in Act II, scene i, sails from Brittany, which lies across the English Channel to the south of England, and then sails around the south and up the east coast of England to land at Ravenspurgh, which is on England's northeast coast . Bolingbroke and his men then ride southwest across the northern part of England; they move nearly all the way across the country to arrive at Berkeley Castle, in the wild high western country near the border of England and Wales, where the Duke of York has gathered his small forces. This is where they meet up with young Harry Percy, and then with York, in Act II, scene iii. From here it is not far southeast to Bristol Castle, where Bushy and Greene are apprehended and executed in Act III, scene i. When King Richard sails away to Ireland between the end of Act II, scene i and the beginning of Act II, scene ii, he presumably departs from the west coast of Wales . We do not see him again until Act III, scene ii, when he returns to the Welsh coast, landing near a northern point called Harlech . When Richard learns from Salisbury and Scroope that Bolingbroke has invaded and gained power in England during his absence, he heads northeast to Flint Castle, on the northern coast of Wales, to await Bolingbroke and his men. Here, Bolingbroke finds him in Act III, scene iii, and brings Richard back with him to London. Pomfret Castle, where Bolingbroke decides to send Richard after his deposition instead of imprisoning him in the Tower, is a long way from London: it is in the proverbially wild and desolate northern country of Yorkshire, not far from Ravenspurgh, which was Bolingbroke's landing point. This would be the right place to send someone whom you did not want to hear from again, or whom you expected might \"accidentally\" wind up with an assassin's knife in his throat.", "analysis": ""}
