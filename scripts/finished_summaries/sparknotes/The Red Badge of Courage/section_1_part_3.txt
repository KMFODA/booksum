{"name": "Chapter IV", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210301224522/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/redbadge/section2/", "summary": "The regiment stops in a grove with the chaos of battle raging around them. The regiment's lieutenant is shot in the hand. The soldiers of the 304th take their place on the line, and veteran soldiers who mock their inexperience surround them. As a group of enemy soldiers thunders toward them, Henry and his regiment load their weapons and prepare to engage. Miserably, Henry remains convinced that when he has to confront the worst that war has to offer, he might distinguish himself not by how bravely he fights, but by how quickly he runs away", "analysis": "The self-doubt awakened in Henry in Chapter I continues to plague him as he draws closer to battle in Chapter II. He oscillates between grand, dramatic fantasies of the \"traditional courage\" that leads to glory in the field and an innocent belief that the army is never going to fight--that his regiment, rendered impotent by Christian education, constitutes merely a \"blue demonstration.\" Henry's experiences eventually shatter these preconceptions. His development into a man who understands that courage, duty, and manhood are complicated and sometimes compromised is the most compelling aspect of The Red Badge of Courage. Even at this early stage, there are excellent opportunities to scrutinize Henry's conflicted character. He is incredibly vain, obsesses over his own feelings, and seems unwilling to differentiate between moral behavior and behavior that simply wins him the envy and praise of others. In other words, he is less concerned with duty than with glory. He fears being exposed as a coward, not because cowardice marks a shirking of his responsibilities as a soldier, but because such exposure would deny him an illustrious reputation. After all, Henry's desire for a noble name prompts his enlistment in the first place--he feels little obligation to earn the title of hero. Rather, the \"lavish expenditure\" of food, smiles, and compliments that he meets on the way to Washington proves to be enough to make him believe that he deserves such rewards. As the novel progresses, Henry comes to the painful realization of his own insignificance in the grand scheme of the universe--as his mother tells him in Chapter I, he is \"jest one little feller amongst a hull lot of others.\" When the marching troops come across a corpse, Henry feels \"the impulse of the living to try to read in dead eyes the answer to the Question.\" \"The Question\" is never articulated, but the answer, which Henry moves closer and closer to learning, has much to do with understanding the modest and fragile proportions of one's life and the meaning of honor. Crane uses passing moments such as Henry's memory of his mother's advice and this first encounter with a dead soldier to plant some of the novel's larger ideas in the reader's mind. The narrative's major thematic concerns, such as the irresolvable tensions between self-preservation and the impetus to behave honorably, begin to be defined."}
