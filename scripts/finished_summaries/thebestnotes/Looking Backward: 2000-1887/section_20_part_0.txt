He tells her he has avoided it for fear of arousing painful feelings, but now he feels strong enough to do so. When they go down to the room, he is amazed at how removed he feels from his former life. He feels as if he has actually lived all these years and that time has healed the wounds of his departure. When Edith asks him about his family and friends, he tells her about Edith Bartlett and weeps. Edith Leete weeps with him. When he recovers, she tells him to remember that Edith Bartlett wept for his death over a hundred years ago and that she has been in heaven now for years. He feels comforted by this and is again amazed at how removed he feels from his former feelings for Edith Bartlett. As they are leaving the room, he notices his safe and exclaims over how odd it is that all the money and gold in his safe would not buy him even a loaf of bread now.", "analysis": ""}
