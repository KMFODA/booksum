Julian West is surprised at the early age of retirement. He thinks it seems too early to put people out of work when they have plenty of good years ahead of them. Doctor Leete answers that people work only for duty, but they all look forward to the age of forty five as the best time of their life because it begins the time of the higher and larger activities. If they are not interested in independent scholarship or art, they can simply travel and live a leisurely existence. They also discuss the sports of the twentieth century. The prizes are never monetary. The various guilds compete against one another with a healthy rivalry.", "analysis": ""}
