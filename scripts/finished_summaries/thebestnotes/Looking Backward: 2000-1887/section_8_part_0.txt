He lies in bed dozing and thinking of Decoration Day, which he spent with Edith and her family. He begins to think about their wedding when his pleasant reverie is interrupted with worries about the builder's letter he had read the previous day. He realizes he has an appointment with the builder at eleven and when he looks for the clock he does not see one. Suddenly he is thrown into a terrible crisis, and for a few minutes he does not know where he is or even who he is. Then suddenly he remembers where he is. He runs from the room. He finds no one downstairs, and so he goes outside. He wanders around the modern city of Boston for two hours. He is astonished at the changes in the city. From his perspective, Boston seems to have been transformed over night. When he returns home, he throws himself on the couch and groans in agony. Edith Leete calls out to him and asks him what is the matter and where he has been. He tells her of his anguished morning and she sympathizes so much that she begins to cry. Her sympathy calms his nerves and makes him feel less a stranger in this new time. She makes him promise to confide in her the next time he feels such anxiety. Finally, she tells him that he does not really deserve pity and that he himself will soon be grateful to be in this new world, instead of the one that he once knew.", "analysis": ""}
