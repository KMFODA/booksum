{"name": "overview", "summary": "The plot  opens with John Durbeyfield, Tess' lazy father, walking from Shaston to the village  of Marlott. Along the way, he meets the Parson who tells him about the nobility  of his heritage and his relation to the wealthy family named D'Urbervilles. As  a result of this news, John and his wife Joan send their daughter Tess to seek  financial help from the Widow Mrs. D'Urberville. Tess meets Alec D'Urberville,  the son, who is impressed with Tess's beauty and offers Tess a job at Trantridge,  the estate of his mother. Even though she despises Alec, she accepts the position  in order to help her family, who is extremely poor. After working at Trantridge  for several months, Alec seduces Tess in the woods. She stays with him for a few  weeks, but when she can no longer stand to be around him, she returns to her parents  and is filled with guilt and remorse. Her parents accept the situation without  complaint. A child, appropriately named Sorrow, is born to Tess, but the baby  soon falls ill and dies. In an attempt to overcome her sorrows and begin a new life for herself, Tess leaves  Marlott after a year and goes to work as a dairymaid at Talbothay's farm. Here  she meets Angel Clare, an apprentice at the farm, who is extremely conventional  about morality. He is attracted to Tess for her beauty and freshness. Tess also  admires and respects Angel, but at first keeps him at a distance. Her past misadventure  forces her to consider herself unworthy of him. As the summer passes, a relationship  develops between them. When he proposes marriage, she initially refuses because  of her past, but his persuasion eventually breaks her resistance. Before the wedding,  she tries, on several occasions, to confess her past to Angel, but he always stops  her. He says they will make confessions to one another after they are married,  but Tess tries one more time. Just before the wedding, she writes a letter about  her past and pushes it under the door of Angel's room, but Angel does not notice  the letter. She, at first, assumes that he has read the letter and intends never  to mention her revelation out of love for her. Then two hours before the wedding,  she discovers the truth and is overwhelmed with grief and anxiety, but the wedding  takes place. During their honeymoon, Tess musters up her courage and explains  her victimization by Alec to her husband. Angel is shocked by the news. Tess is  equally appalled that Angel's love for her and her devotion to him could be marred  by a past event in which she was no more than an innocent victim. Angel, however,  is unable to forgive the past. After a few days, he announces to Tess that they  must part, but that her material needs are to be met by money he would give her. Deserted by her husband who goes to Brazil, Tess is shattered and returns  to work in the fields. Her imploring letters to Angel are ignored, and gradually  she is convinced that she will never see him again. Later she again encounters  Alec, her seducer, who has become a preacher. Upon seeing Tess, he revives his  passion for her and deserts his ministry. Although he has genuine regret for the  suffering he has caused her in the past, he pursues Tess relentlessly and begs  her to marry him. She writes to Angel and begs him to return and help her. Tess's  sister appears one night at the farm to tell her that their parents are not well. Mr. D'Urberville soon dies, and the family, without any means, is turned out of  the house. Alec steps in and provides Tess's mother, brothers, and sisters with  a home and security. Tess is moved by Alec's generosity and begins to listen to  him and see him. In the meantime, Angel returns from Brazil in ill health and  ill spirit. During his separation from Tess, he has realized that he still loves  his wife and regrets his harsh treatment of her. On arriving in Wessex, it  is difficult for Angel to find out where his wife is living. He is finally told  that she is at Sanbourne. When he finds her there in a lodge, they are both horrified  at seeing each other in such circumstances. Angel is struck with regret to find  his wife with Alec. Tess is shocked beyond words that her beloved husband has  returned to her, but she sends him away out of shame. Feeling trapped again by  her old seducer, Tess seizes a carving knife and kills Alec. She then runs away  from the hotel after her husband. When she catches up to him, they reconcile and  spend several wonderful days together; but they know their time together is short. A few days later, Tess is caught by the police and taken to prison. She is  later hanged for the murder. Thus, Tess's efforts to fight against fate prove  to be futile. Hardy believed that everyone is a toy in the hands of fate, and  that fate was particularly harsh to women.
