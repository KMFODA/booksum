{"name": "overview", "summary": "Act I opens at Windsor Castle where King Richard listens to the  allegations of his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke (the Duke of  Lancaster), who accuses Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, of  misappropriating royal funds and of masterminding the recent  death of the Duke of Gloucester. Richard tries to effect a  reconciliation between them, but to no avail. Richard has no other  option left but to order that a trial by combat be held at Coventry  to settle the dispute. Just before the combat begins, Richard  decides to banish both the opponents: Mowbray for life and  Bolingbroke for ten years, which is then reduced to six years. Richard notices the show of popular affection for Bolingbroke as  he goes into exile. Richard himself makes plans to leave for  Ireland where a rebellion has broken out. Before he leaves, he is  summoned to the bedside of the dying John of Gaunt,  Bolingbroke's father. In Act II, John of Gaunt anxiously awaits Richard's arrival. He is  hopeful that the young king will listen to the advice of a dying  man. When Richard arrives, Gaunt cautions him against the  flatterers who surround him and berates him for his  irresponsibility in administering the royal funds. Richard's sole  reaction is to dismiss his uncle as a mad \"lean-witted fool.\" As  soon as Gaunt dies, Richard confiscates his property and wealth,  against the protests of the Duke of York, who reminds him of  Bolingbroke's rights. Angered by Richard's outrageous behavior,  Henry Percy, Duke of Northumberland, reviews the king's actions  with Lord Ross and Lord Willoughby, who reveals that the  banished Bolingbroke has already set sail for England with an  army of three thousand men. In the meantime, Sir John Bushy attempts to comfort Queen  Isabel, who is grieving over her husband Richard's departure for  Ireland. Sir Henry Green bursts in with the news that Bolingbroke  has landed and that he has won the allegiance of such powerful  men as Northumberland and his son Harry. In Gloucestershire,  Bolingbroke explains to York, who is acting as the regent in  Richard's absence, that he has violated his sentence of banishment  only to claim his inheritance as Duke of Lancaster. Arriving in Wales in Act III, Richard expresses his happiness at  being in his kingdom once again and is confident that  Bolingbroke's rebellion will soon lose support and collapse. Despite the encouragement of York's son, the loyal Duke of  Aumerle, and the Bishop of Carlisle, King Richard's confidence  declines as he learns from the Earl of Salisbury and Sir Stephen  Scroop that all his supporters have deserted him, including his  most trusted confidante, the Duke of York. In despair, Richard  seeks refuge at Flint Castle. When Bolingbroke arrives before the  castle and learns that Richard is within, he asks to see him,  promising to lay down his arms if his sentence of banishment is  revoked and his property is restored. Richard appears on the walls  of his castle and grants Bolingbroke's demands. Despite his  cousin's fair words, it is evident to Bolingbroke that Richard  retains only a shadow of his former magnificence and power. Meanwhile, Queen Isabel seeks to drive away her cares in the  garden of the Duke of York. A gardener appears, accompanied by  two servants, one of whom wonders why they should take pains  with their garden while disorder prevails in England. The  gardener retorts that if Richard had looked after his garden as  earnestly as they tend theirs, he would not be faced with the loss  of his crown. At this point the Queen makes her presence known  and learns that Bolingbroke has brought Richard to London.
