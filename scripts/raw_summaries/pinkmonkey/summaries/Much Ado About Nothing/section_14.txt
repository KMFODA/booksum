{"name": "Scene 2", "summary": "Act V, Scene 2 Benedick asks Margaret to tell Beatrice he has done as she asked and challenged Claudio to a duel. Margaret, in exchange, asks him to write some love poetry. Beatrice arrives and tells Benedick about the terrible state of young Hero. Ursula arrives with the news of Borachio's arrest and confession, and the truth about Hero. A relieved Benedick and Beatrice continue their verbal sparring, though with much affection. Notes The only real purpose of this scene is to tie up the frayed knots of the Hero situation. The characters not present for the confession are now told of the deception that caused Hero's apparent death and Claudio's unkind treatment. The climax is over and the falling action is set to play out. The only other remarkable thing of interest in this scene is the continued bantering of Beatrice and Benedick. Though they have confessed and proven their esteem for one another, the power struggle continues as they work harder and harder to outdo one another with wit.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820035130/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmMuchado25.asp"}
