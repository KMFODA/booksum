{"name": "Chapter 11", "summary": "Chapter 11 Summary Lucy records in her journal that she feels she can sleep better. Dr. Seward diary records how Mrs. Westenra tells the professor that Lucy is bitter but because she has opened the windows and removed the garlic. Professor rushes up, Lucy looks bloodless again. He gives her blood. He also tells Mrs. Westenra not to remove anything for Lucys room. Lucys journal continue on how she can hear bats flapping on her windowpane. In the meantime, a wolf has escaped from the zoo. After a tiresome escape, he has returned to the zoo. Dr. Sewards journal continues to note on how Renfield attacks him with a knife. Dr. Seward is hurt and bleeds. The blood drips on the floor and Renfield drinks on it crying, \"The blood is the life!\" A strange flapping on her window awakens Lucy. Her mother comes to the room and sees her. Suddenly, they see through the aperture a great gaunt wolf. Mrs. Westenra, in a shock, grabs and tears Lucys garland of garlics and collapses. She is dead and Lucy too faints. When she comes through, she sees the maids putting Mrs. Westenras body on the bed. Suddenly, they shrike and rush out. Lucy is left alone and terrified, she prays for gods help. Notes The wolf appears in two sections in this chapter. The inference is that it is a follower of Dracula, or Dracula himself can change into an animal at his own will. Van Helsing has left Lucy unguarded just for one night but that very night Dracula strikes. Except for the scant protection of the garlics, she is totally helpless at Draculas mercy. This is one of the mistakes Dr. Seward and Van Helsing make, even though they are said to be men of scientific minds with great consciousness of eye.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820041120/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmDracula18.asp"}
