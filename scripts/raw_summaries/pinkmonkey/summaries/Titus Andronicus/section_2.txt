{"name": "Scene 2", "summary": "Scene II Summary The hunting party is in a forest near Rome. Led by Titus, preparations are made for the hunt. Titus has had a very disturbed sleep the previous night and therefore he has a strange feeling of uneasiness. He warns his sons that they must treat the emperor very well Chiron and Demetrius decline joining the hunt and split from the group to indulge in another type of hunting. Notes The scene opens with a positive note with Titus reciting a hunters song, \"The hunt is up, the morn bright and gray...\" But this sense of gaiety is marred by his remark that he has been \"troubled in any sleep this night.\" This is symbolic of the danger that surrounds him and will soon overtake him. Chiron and Demetrius set out to hunt \"a dainty dee.\" The reference is to Lavinia and by splitting up they are putting into motion their plan to abduct and rape her.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820050202/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmTitus14.asp"}
