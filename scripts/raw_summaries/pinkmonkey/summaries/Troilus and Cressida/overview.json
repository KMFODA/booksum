{"name": "overview", "summary": "The Prologue speaks of the 69 Greek princes who had sent ships  laden with men and weapons to recapture Helen, wife of Greek  king Menelaus who has run away with Paris, son of Priam the  King of Troy. The action is placed on the Dardan Plains outside  Troy. In Act I, Scene 1 Troilus, the youngest son of Priam, proclaims  his love for Cressida and laments about the impossibility of  getting to her without going through Pandarus, the go-between. In Scene 2, Cressida pretends to disdain Troilus. She later reveals  that she has been playing hard to get because she believes a  woman is only really precious when she is being courted and that  a mans pleasure lies in trying to win her. So, though her heart is  full of love for Troilus, she will not let him know the truth. In Scene 3, Agamemnon complains to his fellow Greeks that  despite their seven-year siege, Troys walls were still standing. Ulysses launches into his degree speech and says that disregard  of order in nature led to plagues, mutinies, earthquakes, and high  winds. Likewise, communities, academic ranks in schools, guilds  and societies, the prerogatives of age, and inheritance could only  be maintained by respecting hierarchy. Anarchy rules in its  absence. So the strength of the Trojans lay in the discord among  the Greeks. Ulysses then paints a vivid picture of Achilles being  entertained by Patroclus ridiculous imitations of the Greek  leadership. Nestor adds that others like Ajax had been infected by  this attitude. Aeneas enters and presents Hectors challenge to a  duel. It is clear that the challenge is aimed at Achilles. Nestor says that it would be supposed that whoever met Hector  was the choice of the Greek leadership, and whichever warrior  won, it would influence the performance of the whole side. Ulysses says that it would be appropriate for Achilles not to meet  Hector - should he defeat Hector, he would become even more  intolerable. If, instead, he were defeated, then the reputation of the  whole Greek side would be destroyed because of the disgrace of  their best man. He suggests that they decide by lottery - which  would be fixed so that Ajax drew the lot. Then he would be  acknowledged as the better man, thus deflating Achilles pride. If  Ajax returned safely, theyd make much of him: if he failed,  theyd continue to maintain that they had a better man than the  Trojans. In the first scene of Act II, Ajax tries to get the gist of the  proclamation from a railing Thersites but to no avail. An  exasperated Ajax beats him and threatens to continue unless he  hears about the proclamation. Achilles and Patroclus enter and tell  Ajax about the proclamation. Achilles says that if it hadnt been  for the lottery, he himself would be the best match for Hector. Scene 2 begins with Priam revealing that Nestor had reiterated  that if Helen was delivered to the Greeks, all damages would be  forgotten. Hector suggests that they let Helen go. Troilus  disagrees vehemently. Using the metaphor of marriage, he says  that once a man was committed, he was obliged to stand by his  decision. He reminds them that they had cheered for Paris when in  retaliation for the long-ago kidnapping of an old aunt, he had  brought back a young Grecian queen - an object of supreme worth  whose value had launched more than a thousand ships and turned  kings into merchants. Cassandra enters and exhorts the Trojans to  learn to weep as Troy would burn unless they let Helen go. Troilus denounces her for a madwoman, and says that the rest of  the Trojans had committed themselves to honoring Helen. They  may, he implies, be proved imprudent by the consequences; but  justice cannot be made merely pragmatic. Paris says he would  wipe off the soil of Helens rape by keeping her honorably.
