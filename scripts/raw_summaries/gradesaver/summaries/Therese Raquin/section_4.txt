{"name": "Chapters 18-21", "summary": "Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is reeling from the same nightmare - the horrifying ghost of Camille - that has begun to plague Laurent.  Desperate for solace and peace, and convinced that Laurent\u2019s presence will protect her against Camille\u2019s phantom, she decides to set the marriage in rapid motion.<PARAGRAPH>However, the lovers have somewhat different motives for making their marriage a reality.  Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is motivated mainly by passion and panic; her nerves stretched to the breaking point, she feels instinctively that she will be driven out of her mind without Laurent to comfort her.  Laurent takes a more rational approach.  He realizes that he will probably not get any money from his father under any circumstances, and he also realizes that Mme Raquin has savings worth 40,000 francs at her disposal.  Obtaining this money would ensure a comfortable life and would justify Camille\u2019s murder.<PARAGRAPH>In order to bring about their marriage without arousing suspicions, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent begin to manipulate Mme Raquin and her Thursday evening guests.  Th\u00e9r\u00e8se puts on a mood of extreme melancholy, which leads Mme Raquin to worry.  Old Michaud, however, is convinced that he has the solution to Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2019s downcast mood.  He advises Mme Raquin to marry off Th\u00e9r\u00e8se as quickly as possible; a proposal that initially disconcerts the old haberdasher.  Soon, however, Mme Raquin is revitalized by the task of arranging a good marriage for Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and reinvigorated by the prospect of opening a new, positive chapter in her life.<PARAGRAPH>While Th\u00e9r\u00e8se continues to sulk, Laurent manipulates and deceives Mme Raquin in his own way.  He appears frequently at the Passage du Pont-Neuf, attending to the needs of the household, and constantly voices his sorrow over Camille\u2019s untimely death.  Mme Raquin is won over by this attitude of concern, as are her guests.  It soon occurs to Old Michaud, without any direct statements on Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2019s or Laurent\u2019s part, that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent would make a fine pair.<PARAGRAPH>Together, Mme Raquin and Old Michaud decide to broker the marriage; Mme Raquin counsels Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, while Old Michaud deals with Laurent.  The two lovers pretend to resist the idea, out of respect for one another and for Camille\u2019s memory, but they eventually give in.<PARAGRAPH>In the presence of Mme Raquin and Old Michaud, the betrothed Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent enact a scene that is outwardly touching - and that hides their real discomfort.  The lovers link hands, but recoil at the cold touch of one another\u2019s skin.  Laurent, moreover, claims that Camille had called out to him during the fatal catastrophe on the Seine, imploring him to save Th\u00e9r\u00e8se.  Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is aghast at this lie, yet she continues to remain composed and is eager to see the marriage take place, if only because it will free her of Camille\u2019s haunting influence.<PARAGRAPH>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent wake up happy on the day of their wedding; they are convinced that their nights of terror will soon be at an end.  Yet on the morning of the wedding, Laurent is discomfited by the scar that Camille left on his neck.  He manages to keep his composure and adorns himself in his new wedding clothes - a gift from Mme Raquin to the impoverished Laurent.  The wedding itself proceeds smoothly, with all the Thursday evening regulars in attendance.<PARAGRAPH>Following the official ceremonies at the town hall and at church, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, Laurent, and the Thursday evening guests adjourn to small restaurant for the wedding reception.  The mood is fairly reserved and somber, partially because Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent have new cares of their own; the scar has begun to pain Laurent again and both newlyweds feel dull and morose.  Grivet, however, makes an off-color comment about the future children of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent.  Bride and groom turn pale, and their state of exhaustion and anxiety continues until, at last, they reach their bedchamber in the Passage du Pont-Neuf.<PARAGRAPH>Laurent and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se find themselves in their bedroom - once the site of their passionate affair - which Mme Raquin has heated with a hearty fire and adorned with bunches of roses.  Despite these inviting settings, the two newlyweds regard one another with timidity, and even disgust.  They try to muster new passion, yet Laurent makes the mistake of speaking Camille\u2019s name - a mistake that unleashes horrible memories and makes any attempt at intimacy impossible.<PARAGRAPH>Nonetheless, the husband and wife try to chat and begin to disrobe for bed.  They find that it is impossible to drive Camille out of their minds and even seem to follow one another\u2019s anguished reflections on the dead man.  Th\u00e9r\u00e8se asks Laurent about the Morgue, whether he had seen Camille\u2019s body.  And Laurent, wanting closure of his own, implores Th\u00e9r\u00e8se to kiss the scar on his neck, hoping that her lips will sooth the burning mark.  Yet these efforts to find solace are always defeated.<PARAGRAPH>Soon, the contents of the room begin to plague the two lovers.  Camille\u2019s portrait remains on the wall, since Mme Raquin had neglected to move it elsewhere.  Both Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent are haunted by the drowned man\u2019s disturbing, crudely-painted visage.  The cat Fran\u00e7ois also makes an appearance, creating eerie scratching noises and driving the superstitious Laurent even deeper into panic.<PARAGRAPH>After a sleepless night - which Th\u00e9r\u00e8se spends sitting by the dying fire, and which Laurent spends pacing mechanically to and fro - the two resolve to try to make the most of their situation and live together pleasantly.  The resolution, however, seems difficult, and perhaps doomed.", "analysis": "Early in these chapters, Zola signals that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent have one and the same perspective: \u201cAn affinity of blood and lust had been established between them.  They shuddered the same shudders and, in their hearts, a sort of agonizing fellowship ached with the same terror\u201d (94).  Formerly, Zola took great pains to differentiate the sanguine Laurent and the nervous Th\u00e9r\u00e8se.  The temperamental differences between the two murderers have not yet broken down - Th\u00e9r\u00e8se wants to marry because she fears a nervous crisis, while Laurent cautiously weighs the costs and benefits of a union - yet the deadly links between the two characters are becoming tighter.<PARAGRAPH>None of the other characters have the least hint of how trapped Laurent and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se feel.  The two protagonists realize this, and they decide to speed along their marriage by staging a further set of manipulations.  In order to win Mme Raquin over to the idea of a new marriage, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se adopts an especially interesting ploy.  She neither conceals her negative state of mind nor fully reveals it - instead, she strikes a note that is dour enough to arouse Mme Raquin\u2019s concern, but not to suggest her true psychological torture.  Mme Raquin is indeed convinced that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se has \u201cretreated into herself and seemed to be dying of some unknown sickness\u201d (99).  She misdiagnoses the sickness as maidenly loneliness, though Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is in fact dying of neurotic terror.<PARAGRAPH>As the narrative moves forward, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent continued to be grouped together in emphatic ways.  They are not simply companions in sorrow.  Despite their nocturnal torments, they manage to share a few sympathetic joys; for instance, on their wedding morning they wake up \u201cwith the same profoundly joyful thought: they told themselves that their last night of terror was over\u201d (108).  Even their acquaintances regard them in terms of similarity, and Mme Raquin regards them not as bride and groom, but as \u201cher two dear children\u201d (104).<PARAGRAPH>It is clear that Mme Raquin and the Thursday guests are eager for a new beginning.  Yet as with the resumption of the Thursday evenings, this \u201cnew beginning\u201d is less of a radical, refreshing departure and more of a return to the same comforting, stupefying routines.  By the time of the wedding party, Grivet is back to his stupid jokes and Mme Raquin is mostly her affectionate old self.  And the idea of the new husband and wife as \u201cchildren\u201d is itself a return to form, since Mme Raquin also regarded the married Camille and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se as her children.  Laurent is simply a new \u201cchild,\u201d occupying exactly the same place that Camille once occupied in Mme Raquin\u2019s household and affections.  Eerily enough, he becomes a double for his murder victim.<PARAGRAPH>For Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent, Camille\u2019s lingering influence isn\u2019t merely impossible to escape; indeed, Camille\u2019s influence starts to take on new forms.  During their wedding night, the newlyweds are vexed by Camille\u2019s long-disregarded portrait and alarmed by Mme Raquin\u2019s tabby cat, whom Laurent equates with Camille.  Laurent doesn\u2019t even have the limited comfort of being able to toss off the earlier manifestations of Camille, since the drowned man\u2019s scar remains on his neck, resisting any and all soothing efforts.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210425133639/https://www.gradesaver.com/therese-raquin/study-guide/summary-chapters-18-21"}
