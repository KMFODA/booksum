{"name": "Essay 40", "summary": "Madison responds to the claim that the constitutional convention was authorized to frame and propose an entirely new form of government.  Anti-Federalists charged that the convention had been formed to merely amend the Articles, not throw them out entirely in favor of the proposed constitution.<PARAGRAPH>Madison argues that Congress had clearly authorized the convention to form a \u201ca national and adequate government.\u201d  Although it had only been explicitly instructed to accomplish this through \u201calterations and provisions in the articles of confederation,\u201d Madison argues that \u201calterations and provisions\u201d alone would not be sufficient to achieve a \u201cnational and adequate government.\u201d  Therefore, the convention rightly decided that it was more important to create the proper form of government than to limit itself to merely amending the Articles.<PARAGRAPH>Madison argues further than the \u201cgreat principles of the constitution proposed by the convention\u201d are really just \u201cthe expansion of principles which are found in the articles of confederation.\u201d  The problem with the Articles is that the principles were too \u201cfeeble and confined.\u201d  All the Constitution does is empower the government to govern effectively on these principles.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Madison points to the fact that the Articles themselves were formed by a convention that was not explicitly authorized to do so.  What matters ultimately, according to Madison, is whether the plans offered are good advice.  The proposed constitution ought to be judged on its merits, not on the mere technicality of whether the convention was authorized to propose it.", "analysis": "One of the many objections of the Anti-Federalists was that the Constitutional Convention had gone far beyond the authority granted to it by the states to amend the Articles.  Madison is essentially dismissing this criticism as a technicality.<PARAGRAPH>He acknowledges that the convention was not explicitly authorized to create an entirely new form of government, but asserts that the convention nevertheless acted in the best interests of the American people.  Madison\u2019s argument, like most arguments contained in the Federalist Papers, is an appeal to pragmatism, common sense, and the greater good of the people, and a rejection of the mere technicalities and overzealous ideological quibbles on which the Anti-Federalists\u2019 arguments were based.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210418044431/https://www.gradesaver.com/the-federalist-papers/study-guide/summary-essay-40"}
