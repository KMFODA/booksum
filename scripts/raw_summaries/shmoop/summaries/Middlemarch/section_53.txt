{"name": "Book 6, Chapter 54", "summary": "Dorothea has decided to move back to Lowick, despite Celia's pleadings.<PARAGRAPH>Dorothea isn't interested in staring at Celia's baby all day. She'd be happy to help take care of it, but there's a nurse to do all the dirty work, and watching the every move of an infant isn't her idea of a good time.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Cadwallader thinks that Dorothea will go crazy in that big house all by herself, but Dorothea has made up her mind. She's twenty-one (and so legally can make her own decisions).<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Cadwallader thinks Dorothea should get remarried, and tells her husband so, but he tells her to lay off the matchmaking.<PARAGRAPH>So Dorothea goes home to Lowick, resolved to do some good with her money if she can.<PARAGRAPH>She has also resolved not to do anything with Mr. Casaubon's research.<PARAGRAPH>Her biggest desire is to see Will Ladislaw, but she doesn't know how to arrange it.<PARAGRAPH>She wants to make up for her husband's injustice to him (she still doesn't know he has a crush on her).<PARAGRAPH>But Will makes it easy \u2013 he comes to see her, but just to say goodbye.<PARAGRAPH>Their meeting is awkward. He knows about the will, and Mr. Casaubon's suspicions, and he's just plain embarrassed.<PARAGRAPH>He says that he's going away to London to work as a lawyer (a \"barrister\" is a lawyer in Britain) for all the political goings-on.<PARAGRAPH>Dorothea is happy that he's going to be working for the betterment of mankind and all that, but is sorry that he'll be gone for so long.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, Sir James Chettam comes in.<PARAGRAPH>Sir James still thinks of Dorothea as some kind of saint (he and Will Ladislaw agree there), and he doesn't like the idea of Will Ladislaw poking around her shrine.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he suspects Will of trying to marry her because she's rich.<PARAGRAPH>So he's a little stiff and rude when he sees that Will is there.<PARAGRAPH>Will and Dorothea say goodbye, and Will leaves.<PARAGRAPH>Dorothea is annoyed with Sir James \u2013 she knows what he's thinking, because she knows about Casaubon's will.<PARAGRAPH>But she acts as though nothing is wrong so that Sir James won't say anything about Will.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210307064824/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/middlemarch/summary/book-6-chapter-54"}
