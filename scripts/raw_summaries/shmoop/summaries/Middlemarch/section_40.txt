{"name": "Book 4, Chapter 41", "summary": "The chapter opens with a description of Joshua Rigg Featherstone \u2013 he looks like a frog, as we've already been told, but he's generally a sober and upstanding guy, though possibly a little too ambitious.<PARAGRAPH>Rigg, or Rigg Featherstone, as everyone now has to call him (he had to change his name when he inherited the estate), has a visitor \u2013 a guy named John Raffles.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently Raffles had married Rigg's mother, and Rigg has never liked his stepfather (Raffles says \"father-in-law,\" not \"stepfather,\" but don't be confused \u2013 it's a British thing).<PARAGRAPH>Raffles is after money, of course. Rigg is ashamed of his stepfather; Raffles knows it and is hoping that Rigg will pay him to stay away.<PARAGRAPH>Rigg doesn't disappoint \u2013 he gives Raffles a brandy bottle to top up his flask, and a sovereign (a pretty good sum of money in those days).<PARAGRAPH>Raffles fills his flask from the bottle, and wedges it closed with a letter he found lying around \u2013 something signed by \"Nicholas Bulstrode\" \u2013 and takes off.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210307064824/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/middlemarch/summary/book-4-chapter-41"}
