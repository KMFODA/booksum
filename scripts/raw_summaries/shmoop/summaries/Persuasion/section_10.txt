{"name": "Chapter 11", "summary": "Lady Russell is due to return, and Anne wonders if she will see more or less of Wentworth once she leaves Uppercross for Kellynch Lodge.<PARAGRAPH>Captain Wentworth disappears for a few days; when he comes back, he explains that he was visiting his friend Captain Harville, who is currently nursing an old wound at the nearby seaside resort Lyme Regis.<PARAGRAPH>His description of the town and his friend gets everyone so excited, there\u2019s only one solution: road trip!<PARAGRAPH>They arrive in the November evening at the picturesque village, and our narrator waxes poetic about its loveliness.<PARAGRAPH>Captain Wentworth introduces everyone not only to Captain Harville, but also to Captain Benwick, who had sailed on the Laconia with Harville and Wentworth.<PARAGRAPH>Benwick was engaged to Harville\u2019s sister Fanny, but she died before they could get married, and Benwick has been depressed ever since.<PARAGRAPH>Anne thinks that Benwick is a bit of a poser, since her heart\u2019s just as broken as his and she\u2019s not nearly so mopey; also, as a man, Benwick has far more opportunities to go find someone else or do something else than stuck-at-home Anne has had.<PARAGRAPH>We get a careful class ranking of the characters: Captain Harville is \"a perfect gentleman,\" though \"not equaling Captain Wentworth in manners\" (does this mean Wentworth is more than perfect?), and Mrs. Harville is a step down the ladder in \"polish\" (11.15)<PARAGRAPH>While the Harvilles may not have polish, or, as it soon becomes apparent, much wealth, they do have genuine kindness and hospitality in spades, and Anne gets a little depressed thinking that, through not marrying Wentworth, she also missed out on his network of friends.<PARAGRAPH>Though the Harville lodgings are small, the Captain has tricked them out to make the most of the space, and Anne is impressed by his creativity and constant activity.<PARAGRAPH>The Musgroves & Co. head back to their hotel for dinner.<PARAGRAPH>After dinner, Captains Harville and Benwick come for another visit, and Anne ends up talking to the still Eeyore-ish Benwick.<PARAGRAPH>Their chatting focuses mostly on his favorite, mostly depressing poetry (modern conversational equivalent: do you think Bright Eyes or Death Cab for Cutie is better?), and Anne suggests that Benwick might be cheerier if he read some inspirational, character-building prose once in a while (or listened to some stadium rock?), though privately she thinks that she hasn\u2019t been all that good at taking her own advice.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422142502/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/persuasion/summary/chapter-11"}
