{"name": "Chapter 5, Sketch Sixth: Barrington Isle and the Buccaneers", "summary": "Hey, there's a quote from Spenser. Hello quote from Spenser.<PARAGRAPH>Melville tells you that Barrington Island was the home of pirates, or buccaneers.<PARAGRAPH>Its isolation meant that pirates could hang out without fear of being hunted down and arrested.<PARAGRAPH>Barrington Island has trees and fruit and is generally pleasant, unlike all the other islands around. Thus a happy place for pirates.<PARAGRAPH>The narrative quotes some unknown sentimental traveler. Why? Maybe because random quotation is fun?<PARAGRAPH>Anyway, the random quotation and Melville agree that pirates are awful, but argue that some of them are maybe not so bad.<PARAGRAPH>You wonder what the random quotation person would say if pirates robbed him. But that we shall never know.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201207031456/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-piazza-tales/summary/chapter-5-sketch-sixth-barrington-isle-and-the-buccaneers"}
