{"name": "Book 6", "summary": "Marcus reiterates the benign nature of the Whole: the overseeing Reason creates everything for a purpose and for the harmonious maintenance of the universe.<PARAGRAPH>Since everything created by the Whole is essentially right and harmless, it's a comfort to know also that everything has its origin and its ending in the Whole as well.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus reminds himself only to do his duty and not to worry about how he's feeling or what other people are saying about him. Even death should not sway him.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, by dying, Marcus believes that he will be doing the most dutiful thing ever, since it is an obligation of nature.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus tells himself to be attentive to things that should be valued.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus would have been a David Bowie fan, because he's on about changes again. In this case, everything in the universe will either be dispersed in some way or other\u2014it can't remain.<PARAGRAPH>The Whole knows what it's about. Marcus implies here that even if humanity doesn't understand what the Universe is up to, the Universe itself clearly understands its materials and purpose.<PARAGRAPH>The emperor finally gets to talking about revenge. He claims that the best way to go about it is not to turn into your enemy.<PARAGRAPH>According to Marcus, happiness is doing social acts continuously and being mindful of god.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus defines the \"direction mind\": this kind of mind is always looking to comply with its nature and sets about to shape experience to suit itself.<PARAGRAPH>The Whole rules everything; nothing can do or be anything outside of the Whole.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus discusses the prominent views about the nature of the universe: it's either a random \"stew\" of atoms and mere dissolution at the end, or it's a purposeful and well-ordered structure.<PARAGRAPH>The first does not appeal to Marcus. Why even bother if accident is all there is?<PARAGRAPH>Marcus doesn't know exactly which order rules the universe. But if it's the second choice (providence and unity), he's all for it, as this gives him something to live for.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus tells himself that swift recovery from distress is crucial. Practice returning to the normal rhythm of life makes it more likely that he won't fall out of it too often.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus compares the court to a stepmother and philosophy to a mother. He claims that a son who has both would naturally return to his mother for comfort and advice.<PARAGRAPH>The same has to be true of philosophy for Marcus. She's the mother in this scenario, and she can provide him with the comfort he seeks; she will make court life livable.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus has a penchant for reality checks. In this case, he reminds himself that his roasted meats are really just dead bodies. His wine, no matter how fine, is just grapes. His fine clothes are made from dirty sheep fluff and dyed with the blood of shellfish.<PARAGRAPH>We won't exactly recount what he says about sex here, but you can imagine: it's no big deal.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus engages in these mental exercises so that he doesn't attach more importance to things than they actually have. He strips things bare to understand what they are. It also cuts down on vanity if you can manage to put your work and your thoughts to the same reality test. What are you actually doing and thinking?<PARAGRAPH>Marcus is constantly finding ways to stratify or categorize people. Here, he declares that people can be defined by what they value.<PARAGRAPH>Most value the usual commodities: saleable natural resources and fine foodstuffs.<PARAGRAPH>Next up on the ladder of stratification are those who value livestock (um, including slaves).<PARAGRAPH>And then there are those who begin to focus on how the rational soul displays itself in human skill (craftsmen, etc.).<PARAGRAPH>But the very cream of the crop (like Marcus himself) focus only on their reason and on performing \"social acts.\"<PARAGRAPH>More changes. There is a constant flux of those coming into this world and those going out. It's a process of constant renewal.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, Marcus mentions this to point out that there is no reason to value the things of this world, since they come and go so swiftly.<PARAGRAPH>In the cosmic scheme of things, individual life is no more important or lasting than a single breath.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus wants to redirect our attention away from useless actions (like breathing or perceiving) to something more valuable.<PARAGRAPH>But what? Certainly not praise. To Marcus, the important thing is following the path of our nature, as directed by the universe.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus sees the working of a craftsman as a good example, since craftsmen make things suited to a certain purpose.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus says that the only thing to be valued is doing what you were sent into the world to do, in other words to follow your purpose.<PARAGRAPH>If he persists in valuing those other things, Marcus will wind up being a discontented man, reliant on external things. He must value his mind and his lot in life, and if he does, all will be well.<PARAGRAPH>The elements are changeable, wild things, but social action drives a person down a more pleasant path, though harder to discern.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus is speaking of \"them\" again\u2014the mass of people around him. These are the people who are gossip-mongers, speaking badly of others yet concerned about their own reputations. Marcus feels that their actions are futile.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus puts himself in his place by reminding himself that things that are hard to do are not impossible. They are just hard for him, though not out of reach.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus sees life as a \"field of play\" in which we learn to recognize that our opponents\u2014even though they scratch and push\u2014are not actually our nemeses.<PARAGRAPH>The same is true in life off the field. People who are against Marcus are merely opponents in a game; they are not people he should passionately hate.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus claims that he will gladly change any of his ways if someone can show him that he's wrong. He's all about the truth. Besides, it's worse to continue in error than to change.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus says that he minds his own beeswax and does what he knows he has to do. Everything and everyone else are just distractions.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus reminds himself to stay above it all, because he has reason. He must treat animals and things with \"decency,\" and men with tolerance.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus extends his morbid bent to this work, too: even if he only practices these good principles for three hours before he dies, it's time well spent.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus muses on death as the great equalizer: Alexander the Great and the man in charge of his mules were made the same by death. Their atoms were dispersed in the same way throughout the universe.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus reflects on how many different things are going on inside the bodies and minds of people at the same moment. He uses this example to extrapolate a truth about the harmony of the universe: everything that happens exists together in the Whole.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus talks about being asked how to spell \"Antoninus\" and how he should respond. He could lose his temper and behave badly. Or he could respond like a rational man and just spell the darn name.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus reflects on the nature of duty: it's a completed action\u2014and you have to get through each step calmly until you've reached the end.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus chides himself for not letting the people around him do things to their own advantage; he calls them out for being wrong. He reasons with himself that he only does this because these people are ignorant. Then his better side tells him that he must correct and teach them gently\u2014not nag.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus speaks of death as a welcome release not only from unpleasant things, but also from the maintenance of the body and an active mind.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus finds it shameful if a man's soul should give out before his body does.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus warns himself not to get all fancy (\"Caesarified\"). He wants to keep it simple and keep himself pure, as philosophy has taught him. To do this, he's got to keep his mind on the gods and be good to people.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus remembers the lessons taught to him by his adoptive father, Antoninus Pius.<PARAGRAPH>Antoninus had many good qualities: he was gentle, simple, earnest, concerned, tolerant. He was never a gossip, he was slow to anger, and he was not judgmental. He was also frugal and not dependent on luxuries.<PARAGRAPH>Antoninus was so dedicated to his work that he wouldn't even get up to pee during the day. He didn't mind criticism, and he delighted in being corrected.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus mentions all this to remind himself how to be\u2014and to say that he wants to have such a conscience on his deathbed.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus tells himself to snap out of it (whatever it is). He's acting like he's asleep, having bad dreams.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus wants to treat his current crises as though they are nothing but nightmares, to see them more clearly in the daylight.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus contemplates his make up: body (indifferent to everything, since it has no reason) and soul/mind (indifferent to everything that doesn't pertain to it).<PARAGRAPH>For the mind, only the present matters. The actions of past and future mean nothing to it.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus tells himself that pain is not contrary to human nature any more than the pain of labor is against a hand or foot. If it's part of the nature of the thing, it's all good.<PARAGRAPH>Pleasure is not for Marcus. Some really bad types of people are really into pleasure.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus notes how experts in their professional fields only defer to laymen on certain points but follow their own knowledge in the execution of their work. Why then would a rational man not follow his own \"directing mind\" for his own benefit?<PARAGRAPH>Marcus reminds himself that even the largest geographical features on the earth are puny compared to the rest of the universe.<PARAGRAPH>The same is true of the present. Our moment in the world is a drop in the bucket compared to all the time of the past and all the time of the coming future.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus says that everything comes from the universal Whole\u2014even the bad stuff. It's just a byproduct of all that is good and lovely.<PARAGRAPH>So, in essence, we shouldn't hate the awful stuff; we should contemplate its origin with wonder.<PARAGRAPH>We get some more on the sameness of everything. If you've seen anything in your lifetime, you've seen everything that ever was or will be.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus encourages himself to see the connection between all things in the universe. This way, he will understand better the \"affinity\" of one thing for the other, as well as the way things follow in sequence because of this.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus tells himself to be content with his place in the world and reminds himself to love the ones he's with\u2014but to make sure the love is real.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus tells himself that even tools made by a craftsman (an external force) are used for their intended purposes. How much more, then, should a human, who has the Whole\u2014which is creator\u2014inside of him want to conform to his purpose?<PARAGRAPH>Nothing can be outside the Whole.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus once again tells himself that things are not good or bad in and of themselves: only thinking makes things good or bad.<PARAGRAPH>As such, the power of judgment is not in the hands of the gods\u2014they can't be blamed when things don't go your way. You've got all the power you need to turn things around in your own head.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus claims that every person in the world contributes to the workings of the universe, whether that person knows it or not. He includes the least-loved types of people, too.<PARAGRAPH>It's in our power to choose how we're going to participate in this universal workforce, however. So Marcus warns himself: be a quality worker, not someone unworthy.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus asks rhetorically if divine beings and heavenly bodies have different roles in the cosmos\u2014and whether or not they still manage to work together.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus puts forth his argument for benevolent gods who are looking out for him. After all, what could possibly be in it for them to do him harm, especially when providence is looking out for the good of the entire human community?<PARAGRAPH>But, for argument's sake, Marcus thinks of a universe in which the gods do not care about the welfare of anything. It makes him uncomfortable to think of this.<PARAGRAPH>In such a universe, Marcus says, he'd have to look out for himself, and to do that, he would choose a rational and social life. It just suits him.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus proclaims himself a citizen of Rome and the world. He can only thrive when these two \"cities\" both prosper.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus reiterates his first idea: everything that happens to him is for the good of the universe.<PARAGRAPH>But it's also true that what's good for the individual is good for the Whole as well.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus is suffering from some serious blues. His life is nothing but boring sameness, and he honestly can't wait to get out.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus tells himself to think of the dead\u2014both highborn men and low\u2014and even of those whose names are already forgotten.<PARAGRAPH>It's no biggie for those who are dead. The important thing is to live life as a lover of justice, truth, and tolerance.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, a cheering thought. Marcus observes the good in his friends to lift his spirits, and he notes that the more he finds virtues in others, the better he feels.<PARAGRAPH>Here's a peculiar line of reasoning: Marcus asks himself if he resents not weighing more. Well, then\u2014why would he resent the short length of his life? He tells himself that he needs to be okay with what he's given.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus talks about \"them\" again. In this case, it's about persuasion. If he can't convince \"them\" of his point of view, he will simply have to gain whatever advantage he can out of the convo. This way, his intention will be somewhat accomplished.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus discusses the \"good.\" Those seeking fame believe it to be praise; for pleasure-seekers, it's something that makes them feel good; and for a man of intellect, it's social action.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus reiterates that things can't form value judgments or have them inherently. Only the mind can do this.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus reminds himself to listen to those around him and be empathetic.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus uses a bee analogy to reiterate that what is good for the Whole is good for the individual.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus makes an implied analogy: if less skilled workers badmouth their leaders, who would they obey? Seems like the emperor is having a bad day at work.<PARAGRAPH>Simple declaration: Look how many of my friends are dead.<PARAGRAPH>An angry Marcus questions perceptions of reality and of \"false representations\" that make the job harder.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus tells himself that there will be no obstacle to following his own nature. Also, only things in accordance with Nature can ever happen to him.<PARAGRAPH>A weary Marcus comments on the behavior of those around him. He feels that \"they\" are willing to do questionable things in order to impress shady people.<PARAGRAPH>Marcus observes that everything will be hidden with the passage of time.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201025193428/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/meditations/summary/book-6"}
