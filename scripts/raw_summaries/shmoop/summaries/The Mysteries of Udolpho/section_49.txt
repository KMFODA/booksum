{"name": "Volume 4, Chapter 12", "summary": "Coming back to Count de Villeforte and his family, we get a taste of all the scenery they've encountered on their little trip. They've had a nice visit with the Baron St. Foix and now they're heading back home.<PARAGRAPH>Young St. Foix is tagging along for the ride, too, since he's smitten with Blanche.<PARAGRAPH>But it's getting dark, and the group seems to have lost their way.<PARAGRAPH>The group stumbles across a fortress in the middle of the woods and decides to rest up for the night.<PARAGRAPH>Blanche is worried that some bad guys live there, and the Count admits it's a definite possibility.<PARAGRAPH>He says these types of fortresses are often inhabited by French and Spanish smugglers. Then he goes and knocks on the door.<PARAGRAPH>A man armed with a hunting spear answers, and the Count convinces him to grudgingly let them all in for the night. This plan is looking better and better.<PARAGRAPH>Some other guys who look like they could be hunters are hanging around the fortress, too.<PARAGRAPH>Hunter-Guy #1 offers to show the de Villefortes to their rooms, but Blanche takes a wrong turn and gets lost.<PARAGRAPH>Good thing she does, 'cause she overhears the \"hunters\" talking about overthrowing their guests. They're discussing how many of the group they'll need to kill.<PARAGRAPH>The Hunter-Guys shall henceforth be known as the Smugglers, since it seems to be their noble occupation. They also dabble in murder and robbery.<PARAGRAPH>Blanche tries to sneak away all casual-like, but the Smugglers catch up with her. She conveniently faints.<PARAGRAPH>When she wakes up, the whole battle between the de Villefortes and the Smugglers is totally over (good going, Blanche).<PARAGRAPH>It looks like they would have been outnumbered had Ludovico not shown up at the last second to help them out.<PARAGRAPH>That's right, you read correctly. Ludovico, the one who disappeared in the haunted chamber a while back.<PARAGRAPH>We're definitely going to get an explanation from him, but the group needs to skedaddle before more Smugglers arrive.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630082640/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/mysteries-of-udolpho/summary/volume-4-chapter-12"}
