The travelers begin to cross the Appenines.<PARAGRAPH>And hey, you guessed it. It's time for Emily to muse on the greatness of nature and the likelihood that bandits are going to pop out from behind trees.<PARAGRAPH>After about a day of travel, Emily catches a glimpse of an intimidating-looking castle.<PARAGRAPH>Emily meets old Carlo, who keeps the castle in his master's absence. He seems like a pretty cool guy.<PARAGRAPH>Em tries to ask Montoni why they picked up and left, but he's keeping his lips zipped.
