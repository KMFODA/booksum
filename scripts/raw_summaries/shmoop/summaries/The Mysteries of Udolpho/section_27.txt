{"name": "Volume 3, Chapter 3", "summary": "The next day, Montoni puts off seeing Em once again. Big surprise.<PARAGRAPH>Em hears a band of men coming back to the castle, bragging about all the plunder they took from neighboring castle. Something tells us this won't end well.<PARAGRAPH>Always big on jumping to conclusions, Em assumes Montoni is a captain of robbers.<PARAGRAPH>Well, the narrator tells us, she's not that far off. Quickie historical context from the narrator: since Italy didn't have enough moolah to support its armies, some ex-soldiers turned to robbery.<PARAGRAPH>Some of them even turned outlaw and took over fortresses where they could stash their ill-gotten cash. These folks are called the Condittieri.<PARAGRAPH>Anyway, Em listens again at night for the strange music. No luck, though.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Em has a meeting with Montoni. He's with several of his officers (ahem, fellow robbers) and won't dismiss them.<PARAGRAPH>Em wants to leave the castle, but Montoni forbids it. Em lets it slip that she thinks Madame M. is dead.<PARAGRAPH>Montoni tells Em her aunt is alive, if not totally well. He gives her permission to go see her in the east turret.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, you could cut the tension with a knife among Montoni and his officers.<PARAGRAPH>Verezzi wants Orsino gone pronto. The two guys start fighting after Em leaves the room.<PARAGRAPH>Em visits Madame M., who is not in fact dead. But she's actually pretty close to dying.<PARAGRAPH>Remember that body Em saw? Yeah, it was someone who died during the fray in the castle.<PARAGRAPH>So Em goes to work persuading Montoni to move her sick aunt out of the east turret. She gets lucky and succeeds, then goes to work taking care of her dear auntie.<PARAGRAPH>The same night, Em sees the human form again. She's not crazy, either, because the watchmen of the castle also see a strange figure wandering about.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630082640/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/mysteries-of-udolpho/summary/volume-3-chapter-3"}
