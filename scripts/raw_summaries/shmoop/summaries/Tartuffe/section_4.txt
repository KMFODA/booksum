{"name": "Act 1, Scene 5", "summary": "Now it's time for the title bout between Cl\u00e9ante and Orgon.<PARAGRAPH>Cl\u00e9ante tells his brother-in-law that Dorine was disrespecting him \u2013 and with good reason. He asks him how he could fall for Tartuffe's tricks.<PARAGRAPH>Orgon will hear none of this. He tells Cl\u00e9ante about how cool, how brilliant and humble Tartuffe is. Soon enough, Orgon promises, Cl\u00e9ante, will see the light. Oh, and Orgon also says that, thanks to Tartuffe and his most excellent teachings, he could lose his whole family, mother, children, brother and wife, and not feel a thing. Yuck.<PARAGRAPH>Cl\u00e9ante listens to Orgon babble on for a while, listens to him talk about his first encounter with Tartuffe. It seems that Orgon found him praying, weeping loudly, kissing the ground, and all sorts of overly showy stuff. This didn't stop Orgon from developing a huge man-crush on Tartuffe and, well, before you know it, he was living in Orgon's house.<PARAGRAPH>He goes on to tell Cl\u00e9ante how Tartuffe helps to \"keep an eye\" on Elmire, and that he's a veritable sin detector. Heck, he won't even hurt a fly.<PARAGRAPH>Cl\u00e9ante, ever reasonable, can't believe what he hears.<PARAGRAPH>When Orgon accuses him of impiety, he flies off the handle \u2013 in the most reasonable way possible, of course \u2013 and tells Orgon what a dunce he is to believe in all of Tartuffe's righteous clap-trap.<PARAGRAPH>Cl\u00e9ante makes it clear that he's no atheist \u2013 he simply knows the difference between truth and lies, real piety and hypocrisy. The difference between the two of them is, well, that Cl\u00e9ante isn't a gullible idiot. Cl\u00e9ante likes big, important terms like Nature and Reason and he, well, really likes to use them. A lot. He talks a lot.<PARAGRAPH>Orgon makes some sarcastic remarks about how wise Cl\u00e9ante is, which only pushes him to speak some more. He talks more about the difference between true men of religion and hypocritical con artists and he names all sorts of obscure philosophers and thinkers to justify his claims.<PARAGRAPH>He lists some key virtues which all good, Christian men should demonstrate: humility, good intentions, a desire to do good works, sincerity, humility, humility and\u2026humility.<PARAGRAPH>At this point, Orgon is sick to death of hearing Cl\u00e9ante lecture, and he asks if he can leave.<PARAGRAPH>Cl\u00e9ante lets him go, but quickly gets him to come back.<PARAGRAPH>He asks about the whole Mariane-Val\u00e8re wedding thing, as per Damis's wishes.<PARAGRAPH>Orgon tells him that, yes, he gave them his blessing and set a date. Cl\u00e9ante asks if he's now postponed it. Orgon has, but he won't say why. Cl\u00e9ante presses him until, finally, Orgon tells him that he plans \"to be guided by Heaven's will.\"<PARAGRAPH>This is not, Cl\u00e9ante knows, good news for Mariane and Val\u00e8re.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210415090456/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tartuffe/summary/act-1-scene-5"}
