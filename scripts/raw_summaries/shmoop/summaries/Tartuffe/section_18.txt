She tells him that she'll hate her life.<PARAGRAPH>The girl says, that if Orgon insists she not marry Val\u00e8re, the least he could do is not force her to marry Tartuffe.<PARAGRAPH>She alludes that if the marriage is forced on her she may take some unspecified \"desperate course\" (4.3.2).<PARAGRAPH>Orgon is moved a bit by her appeal, but he stands firm.<PARAGRAPH>Mariane goes on, telling him that he can give Tartuffe his property and, if he wishes, her own inheritance, but that she would rather live in a convent than wed Tartuffe.<PARAGRAPH>Orgon acts as though Mariane is just being a silly little girl. Then he drops a real bomb on her: the more you hate your husband, he says, the more virtuous you'll be!<PARAGRAPH>Dorine attempts to get a word in, but she's denied. As is Cl\u00e9ante.<PARAGRAPH>Elmire steps into the fray and tells Orgon what a gullible dope he is.<PARAGRAPH>Orgon accuses her of being \"partial\" to Damis, implying that the whole thing was a ploy to discredit Tartuffe.
