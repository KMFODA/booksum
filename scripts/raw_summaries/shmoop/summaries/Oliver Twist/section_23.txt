{"name": "Chapter 24", "summary": "The old lady who came to get Mrs. Corney is withered and ugly, but Dickens launches into a long explanation of why so many people are withered and ugly\u2014it\u2019s because they have so much to stress about, but no worries\u2014everyone\u2019s face looks better (i.e., less anxious) when they\u2019re dead!<PARAGRAPH>When Mrs. Corney gets to the room where the sick woman is, she meets with a young man who is the apothecary\u2019s apprentice [note that they didn\u2019t call a doctor, or even the real apothecary (apothecaries were the ones who mixed up medicines)\u2014they called the apothecary\u2019s apprentice. He\u2019s not even licensed yet.].<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Corney and the apothecary\u2019s apprentice exchange pleasantries \u2013 they seem to know each other well.<PARAGRAPH>They hear the old lady moan, which reminds them to check on her. The apothecary\u2019s apprentice thinks she\u2019s almost dead, and Mrs. Corney sits on the foot of the bed to wait it out.<PARAGRAPH>The apothecary\u2019s apprentice, meanwhile, has been making a toothpick, and starts using it. Then he gets bored, and leaves.<PARAGRAPH>The old lady who had gone to get Mrs. Corney starts speaking in a low voice with the other old woman\u2014who was also helping with the sick woman\u2014about how \"old Sally\" was doing.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Corney gets impatient, and tells the two old women not to bother her for nothing.<PARAGRAPH>Just as she\u2019s about to leave, old Sally sits up in bed and grabs hold of her arm, and says she has to tell her something, and that it\u2019s for her ears alone (the other two women complain a lot, but finally leave the room).<PARAGRAPH>Old Sally confesses that, many years ago (she doesn\u2019t remember the year), she had attended a sick pretty young woman who had given birth to a baby and then died, and that she had robbed the woman of some gold ornament she\u2019d had hanging around her neck.<PARAGRAPH>Old Sally said that the mother told her that a day might come when her baby wouldn\u2019t be ashamed to hear her name mentioned, and would find some friends in the world.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Corney of course wants to know the boy\u2019s name, and old Sally says that they called him Oliver.<PARAGRAPH>And old Sally dies before she can say what the gold was, or any more about it.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Corney leaves casually, without indicating to the two old women (who have come back in to deal with the corpse) that old Sally had said anything at all important.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-24"}
