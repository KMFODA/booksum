{"name": "Chapter 20", "summary": "The next morning Oliver finds that he\u2019s been given a new pair of boots, and wonders why\u2014he hopes that it\u2019s because they\u2019re going to let him go.<PARAGRAPH>At breakfast, Fagin tells him it\u2019s because he\u2019s going to Bill Sikes\u2019s house, but not permanently.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver asks why he\u2019s going, and Fagin won\u2019t tell him.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin stays quiet the rest of the day until he goes out.<PARAGRAPH>On his way out the door, he warns Oliver not to make Sikes angry, but to do as he says. And then he leaves Oliver a book to read while waiting for them to come and fetch him.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver has no idea why he\u2019s being sent to Sikes\u2014he thinks it\u2019s just to be a servant and run errands or something.<PARAGRAPH>He starts to read the book Fagin\u2019s left him, and is soon engrossed\u2014it\u2019s a history of the lives and trials of great criminals (these were wildly popular at the time\u2014Dickens read some of them himself).<PARAGRAPH>The stories of crime are so vivid and dreadful that he throws the book away and prays that he might be spared from such crimes.<PARAGRAPH>Just as he\u2019s calmed himself down a bit, Nancy comes in, and she\u2019s clearly upset about something.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver offers to help her, and she makes a gurgling noise and then starts laughing loudly.<PARAGRAPH>She pretends it was just a passing weird mood, and tells Oliver he\u2019s supposed to go with her to Bill Sikes.<PARAGRAPH>When Oliver asks why, she says it\u2019s no harm, but she can\u2019t make eye contact with him as she says it, and he doesn\u2019t believe her.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver considers appealing to Nancy\u2019s sympathy (it worked before, after all), but then reconsiders\u2014 it\u2019s not that late yet, and there might be people in the street who could help him.<PARAGRAPH>Nancy seems to read his mind, and tells him that if he ever does manage to escape, it won\u2019t be tonight, and that she\u2019s already been beaten for taking his side, but it hasn\u2019t done any good. She promises that she\u2019ll try to help him, but that if he runs away tonight they\u2019d kill her, and that whatever they make him do, it won\u2019t be his fault.<PARAGRAPH>So Oliver gives up thinking about escape for the time being, puts his hand in hers, and away they go.<PARAGRAPH>Outside, they jump into a carriage, and drive off. Nancy warns Oliver about Sikes just as Fagin had.<PARAGRAPH>When they get to Sikes\u2019s house, he\u2019s tempted to call for help in the street, but he remembers that Nancy will get beaten and maybe killed if he does.<PARAGRAPH>When Nancy tells Sikes that Oliver came along without complaining or trying to run away, Sikes says it\u2019s a good thing, or he\u2019d have smacked him around.<PARAGRAPH>Then Sikes gives him a lecture with a pistol as a visual aid\u2014he tells Oliver that when they\u2019re out, Oliver had better not speak unless he\u2019s spoken to, or he\u2019ll get a bullet in the head.<PARAGRAPH>Nancy steps out and brings back dinner (mmm\u2026 sheep's heads). Maybe it\u2019s the porter, and maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s about to go break into a house, but Sikes seems to be in a good mood for a change.<PARAGRAPH>After dinner, Sikes goes to bed, telling Nancy to wake him up at 5 a.m. Oliver goes to sleep on the floor.<PARAGRAPH>The next morning Nancy wakes them both up, and they grab a quick breakfast before heading out.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes gives Oliver a cloak to throw over his clothes.<PARAGRAPH>As they leave, Oliver looks back to Nancy for some parting look or word of advice, but she\u2019s just sitting motionless by the fire.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-20"}
