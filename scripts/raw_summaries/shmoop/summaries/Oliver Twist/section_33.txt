{"name": "Chapter 34", "summary": "Oliver can hardly believe that Rose will get better, so he goes for a walk and cries about it in private.<PARAGRAPH>He comes back with an armful of flowers for Rose\u2019s room just as night is falling.<PARAGRAPH>A post-chaise (the carriage that carried mail from city to city would also take on passengers) passes him on the road at full gallop.<PARAGRAPH>The passengers see him, and call for the driver to stop.<PARAGRAPH>One of the passengers is Mr. Giles, who immediately asks Oliver how Rose is doing.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver says that she\u2019s better, and the second man jumps out of the carriage and asks Oliver if he\u2019s quite sure about it. He seems to care an awful lot.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver\u2019s sure.<PARAGRAPH>The gentleman turns away and sobs with relief. Mr. Giles does the same.<PARAGRAPH>They all walk back to the house together (they send the driver ahead with the luggage).<PARAGRAPH>Oliver notices that the young gentleman is about twenty-five years old, and looks a lot like Mrs. Maylie, so Oliver assumes he\u2019s her son.<PARAGRAPH>When they arrive at the house, Harry (that\u2019s the new guy\u2019s name) asks his mother why she didn\u2019t write sooner, because if Rose had died and he hadn\u2019t been there, he would have been miserable forever.<PARAGRAPH>Then they get in a debate about whether or not he should marry Rose\u2014he wants to, and says he\u2019s been in love with her since forever (which is kind of icky if you remember that she\u2019s only about seventeen, and he\u2019s twenty-five).<PARAGRAPH>But Mrs. Maylie says that Rose will say no, because she has a blight on her name (she\u2019s an orphan, as we already know, and she was illegitimate) and she would be afraid of dragging him down socially.<PARAGRAPH>Harry says he doesn\u2019t care; his heart is set on Rose. And he says he\u2019ll talk to Rose about it before he leaves again.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Maylie says fine, go ahead and talk to her, but she doesn\u2019t think Rose will say yes\u2014Rose wouldn\u2019t want to keep Harry back professionally or socially, so even though she loves him, Mrs. Maylie predicts that she\u2019ll say no.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Maylie leaves to go check on Rose, and Mr. Losberne comes over to say hi to Harry and to Mr. Giles.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Losberne tells Mr. Giles something in a whisper, which Mr. Giles goes down to the kitchen to repeat to all of the servants, with great importance.<PARAGRAPH>Because of his \"gallantry\" on the night of the attempted robbery, Mrs. Maylie has given him a gift of twenty-five pounds (quite a lot of money, especially back then). The other servants are appropriately impressed.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, Mr. Losberne, Harry, and Oliver are chatting away upstairs, and don\u2019t go to bed until late.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver wakes up in a better mood, and, because he can\u2019t go on long walks without Rose, he spends more time on his schoolwork.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s sitting in his little study at the back of the house with the window open, and he falls asleep over his work (that\u2019s never happened to us).<PARAGRAPH>He has a bad dream that he\u2019s back in Fagin\u2019s house, and shut up there again.<PARAGRAPH>He half wakes up because he feels like he\u2019s being watched.<PARAGRAPH>And sure enough, he is\u2014by Fagin, and the man who had gotten all crazy at the inn. They\u2019re standing by the open window and staring at him.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver is understandably creeped out.<PARAGRAPH>Just as they realize that Oliver sees them, the second guy was saying that he\u2019d recognize Oliver anywhere.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver sees all this in a flash, and then runs, calling for help from the rest of the house.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-34"}
