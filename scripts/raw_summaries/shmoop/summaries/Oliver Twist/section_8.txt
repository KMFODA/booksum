{"name": "Chapter 9", "summary": "Oliver wakes up the next morning to find that he\u2019s alone in the room with Fagin. Fagin\u2019s making coffee for breakfast, and seems to be nervous about something\u2014he\u2019s continually looking around to make sure that he\u2019s alone, besides the (apparently still sleeping) Oliver.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver\u2019s only half awake, so Fagin thinks he\u2019s still sleeping. After checking, Fagin opens a trap door in the floor of the room and pulls out a box.<PARAGRAPH>He pulls various jewels and fancy watches out of the box to admire and then put back, talking to himself all the while (remember Scrooge in A Christmas Carol? Dickens was fond of having misers in his books, apparently).<PARAGRAPH>When he realizes that Oliver\u2019s awake and has seen him, he flies into a rage, asking Oliver what he\u2019s seen. When Oliver answers innocently that he\u2019s only seen the pretty things in the box, Fagin pretends that his rage was all a joke, and puts down the bread knife he\u2019s been threatening Oliver with.<PARAGRAPH>Just then the Dodger comes back with one of the other boys, who is introduced as Charley Bates. The four of them sit down to a breakfast of hot rolls and coffee.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin asks the Dodger and \"Master Bates\" (yes, we\u2019re sure the pun was intended\u2014ha, ha, ha) if they\u2019d been working that morning, and the Dodger produces a couple of wallets, and Charley comes up with four handkerchiefs.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver assumes that the boys have made the things they show to Fagin, and Charley laughs and calls him \"green.\"<PARAGRAPH>After breakfast, Fagin (ironically called \"the merry old gentleman\"), Charley, and the Dodger play a \"game\"\u2014or so Dickens calls it, because that\u2019s what it looks like to Oliver. The boys are practicing picking Fagin\u2019s pockets (9.43).<PARAGRAPH>Two young ladies arrive, named Bet and Nancy. They\u2019re described from Oliver\u2019s point of view as \"free and agreeable in their manners,\" and \"stout and hearty,\" so Oliver assumes that they are \"very nice girls indeed\" (9.44).<PARAGRAPH>After drinking some liquor (what is it now, maybe ten or eleven in the morning?), Fagin gives the girls some money, and they go out, accompanied by the Dodger and Charley.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin tells Oliver to \"make \u2019em your models,\" and then plays the pickpocket game with Oliver.<PARAGRAPH>The chapter ends with Oliver learning how to \"take the marks out of the handkerchiefs\"\u2014in other words, he\u2019s learning how to pull the embroidered initials out of handkerchiefs so that they can be resold at a pawnshop (fancy handkerchiefs were expensive, and relatively easy to steal).", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-9"}
