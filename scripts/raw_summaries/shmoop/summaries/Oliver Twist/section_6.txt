{"name": "Chapter 7", "summary": "Noah arrives at the workhouse and dramatically complains to Mr. Bumble that Oliver has almost murdered him.<PARAGRAPH>When he sees the gentleman in the white waistcoat walk by, he starts wailing even louder. (Kind of like certain professional athletes who collapse writhing in front of referees, trying to get a foul called.)<PARAGRAPH>Noah gets the foul called: the gentleman in the white waistcoat repeats his prophecy that Oliver will grow up to be hanged, and sends Mr. Bumble to the Sowerberrys\u2019 house to beat Oliver into submission.<PARAGRAPH>When Mr. Bumble arrives, Oliver\u2019s still so angry that he\u2019s not even afraid of Mr. Bumble.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Bumble tells Mrs. Sowerberry that she\u2019s overfed Oliver, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s plucked up the courage to stand up to Noah and is unafraid of Mr. Bumble. His solution is to starve Oliver for a few days so that he won\u2019t have the energy to fight back when they let him out of the cellar.<PARAGRAPH>When Mr. Sowerberry gets back, his wife\u2019s exaggerations of Oliver\u2019s crimes force him to punish the boy, even though he probably wouldn\u2019t have wanted to without his wife\u2019s pushing.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver spends the rest of the day shut up in the back kitchen, and finally is ordered up to bed.<PARAGRAPH>After crying for a while, Oliver stands up and leaves the house. He\u2019s not sure where he\u2019s going to go, but his first stop is Mrs. Mann\u2019s baby farm.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver stops in front of the gate and sees one of his former playmates and fellow-sufferer, Dick.<PARAGRAPH>Since Dick is the only one up, Oliver risks staying for a few minutes to say goodbye before leaving \"to seek my fortune some long way off.\"<PARAGRAPH>Oliver tries to assure Dick that they\u2019ll meet again sometime, but Dick says no\u2014they\u2019ll only meet again after he\u2019s dead. What an optimistic guy. Apparently the doctor thinks that poor little Dick won\u2019t be long for this world, and Dick hugs Oliver, blesses him, and sends him on his way.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-7"}
