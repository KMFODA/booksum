{"name": "Chapter 18", "summary": "The next day, the Dodger and Charley go out on \"business,\" and Fagin gives Oliver a long lecture on ingratitude, winding up by telling him stories about all the other boys who had taken it into their heads to run away, and somehow ended up getting hanged for crimes they didn\u2019t commit.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver is understandably alarmed.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver spends the rest of the day by himself, locked up in the room with the spiders and mice.<PARAGRAPH>He spends days and days like that. He\u2019s very lonely.<PARAGRAPH>One day, the Dodger and Charley decide to hang out with Oliver a bit in the afternoon.<PARAGRAPH>They make him polish their boots, and chat with him about how great it is to be a \"prig\" (a thief).<PARAGRAPH>Oliver says he\u2019d still rather not be one, thank you very much.<PARAGRAPH>The Dodger and Charley keep trying to talk it up\u2014as a prig, you don\u2019t have to be dependent on anybody because you make your own money, and you\u2019re free to do what you want, etc.<PARAGRAPH>They tell him that he\u2019ll end up one in any case, so he might as well just resign himself to it and get started, because he\u2019s wasting time.<PARAGRAPH>The Dodger tries to justify it by saying that there will always be pickpockets, and it might as well be them.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin comes in just then, and is pleased as can be that the Dodger and Charley have been teaching Oliver to appreciate the fine art of prigging.<PARAGRAPH>A new guy comes in: Tom Chitling. He\u2019s about eighteen years old, and just got out of jail.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver doesn\u2019t quite understand where Chitling\u2019s been, because he hasn\u2019t come out and said it.<PARAGRAPH>Chitling tells Oliver not to worry about it\u2014he\u2019ll find his own way there sooner or later.<PARAGRAPH>After this day, Oliver is rarely left alone anymore. He\u2019s almost always with the boys, who play the old pickpocketing game with Fagin everyday for Oliver to watch, and Fagin tells funny stories about thefts he committed in younger days.<PARAGRAPH>The chapter ends on an ominous note: the narrator insinuates that the Fagin is slowly poisoning Oliver\u2019s soul with all these stories to make thieving seem fun.
