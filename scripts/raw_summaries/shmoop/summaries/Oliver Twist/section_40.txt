{"name": "Chapter 41", "summary": "Rose doesn\u2019t know what to do, but she really, really wants to save Nancy from her life in the streets.<PARAGRAPH>The Maylies are planning on staying in London for only three days on their way to the seashore, and Rose doesn\u2019t know how to deal with the information Nancy\u2019s given her in only that time.<PARAGRAPH>She doesn\u2019t want to tell Mr. Losberne, because he\u2019s too impetuous (remember how he jumped out of the carriage and banged on the door of the thieves\u2019 house, just because Oliver said he thought it was the same one?).<PARAGRAPH>And she doesn\u2019t want to tell Mrs. Maylie, because Mrs. Maylie would immediately tell Mr. Losberne.<PARAGRAPH>Rose thinks about asking Harry, but doesn\u2019t want to ask him for help when she\u2019s just rejected him. Seems like bad form.<PARAGRAPH>She finally decides that asking Harry is the best option, when Oliver comes in, all smiles, saying that Mr. Brownlow is back from the West Indies.<PARAGRAPH>Rose decides to tell Mr. Brownlow all about it, and offers to take Oliver to see him herself.<PARAGRAPH>They take off right away, and Rose goes in first to tell Mr. Brownlow that they\u2019d found Oliver.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Brownlow is sitting in his study with Mr. Grimwig, and Rose tells them that she has news about Oliver.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Grimwig assumes that it\u2019s bad news, of course.<PARAGRAPH>Rose assures them that Oliver\u2019s a great kid\u2014the best boy in the world\u2014and that he\u2019s downstairs waiting.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Brownlow is delighted, and immediately runs out to see the best boy in the world.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Grimwig thinks Rose is just peachy, so he takes this moment to plant a big wet one on her cheek. He excuses himself by saying that he\u2019s old enough to be her grandpa, and that she\u2019s a good girl and he likes her.<PARAGRAPH>Rose thinks he\u2019s kind of odd, but doesn\u2019t say so.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Brownlow comes back in with Oliver, and Mr. Grimwig is happy to see him, too.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Bedwin comes in, and they all cry over each other some more.<PARAGRAPH>After everyone\u2019s done crying, Rose takes Mr. Brownlow to the next room to tell him what Nancy had said.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Brownlow says that he\u2019ll tell Mr. Losberne and Mrs. Maylie all of it, and keep Mr. Losberne from doing anything stupid or rash.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Losberne, when finds out about it, does indeed want to go raid Fagin\u2019s house, but Mr. Brownlow persuades him to chill.<PARAGRAPH>Their main goal, Mr. Brownlow points out, is to figure out who Oliver\u2019s parents were, and to get his inheritance back from his evil brother.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Losberne still thinks they should try to get the thieves all hanged or transported, but Mr. Brownlow points out that they can\u2019t do that without breaking Rose\u2019s promise to Nancy. And besides, they\u2019ll probably all get themselves hanged or transported soon enough, anyway.<PARAGRAPH>Harry Maylie and Mr. Grimwig get added to the committee, and filled in on what\u2019s going on.<PARAGRAPH>So now everyone knows about Monks and the big plot against Oliver except for Oliver.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Brownlow says that he was out of the country on business that is still up in the air, so he won\u2019t tell them about it until it\u2019s all squared away.<PARAGRAPH>Then they go out to supper and rejoin Oliver, who probably thinks they\u2019re all conspiring against him or something.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-41"}
