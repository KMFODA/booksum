{"name": "Chapter 27", "summary": "This chapter returns us to Mr. Bumble, who has been waiting patiently in Mrs. Corney\u2019s room all this time. He\u2019s counted all the silver several times, and decides it\u2019s time to go through the drawers of her dresser. He finds clothes tidily folded, and a locked box that jingles with coins when shaken.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Bumble is very pleased, and declares, \"I\u2019ll do it!\" (27.3).<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Corney comes back in all flustered, and Mr. Bumble blames the paupers, as usual.<PARAGRAPH>To calm her down, he gives her some peppermint something-or-other\u2014she doesn\u2019t say what\u2019s in it, but we\u2019re guessing it\u2019s booze.<PARAGRAPH>He asks what upset her, and she says that she\u2019s \"a weak creetur\" (27.19).<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Bumble takes the opportunity to start hitting on her again, so he says he\u2019s weak, too, and starts fiddling with her apron string (no, really).<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Bumble\u2019s final come-on is, \"The board allow you coals, don\u2019t they, Mrs Corney? [\u2026] Coals, candles, and house-rent free. Oh, Mrs. Corney, what an angel you are!\" (27.32-4).<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Corney can\u2019t resist such a charmer, and allows Mr. Bumble to kiss her on the nose.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Bumble has it all planned out: Mr. Slout, the master of the workhouse, is dying, and Mr. Bumble will be able to take his place, marry Mrs. Corney, and live with her there in her comfy rooms.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Corney is totally smitten, and calls him \"an irresistible duck\" (Seriously; we couldn\u2019t make this stuff up).<PARAGRAPH>Having arranged all that, Mr. Bumble asks what upset Mrs. Corney earlier. She says she\u2019ll tell him after they\u2019re married.<PARAGRAPH>After going on a jealous rant for a moment (he thinks one of the male paupers might have insulted her), Mr. Bumble is satisfied, and heads off to Mr. Sowerberry\u2019s house.<PARAGRAPH>He gets there to find Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry out to dinner, and Noah drunk in the parlor, eating oysters as fast as Charlotte can shell them for him.<PARAGRAPH>Noah offers to kiss Charlotte, and Mr. Bumble bursts in to break it up.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, Noah is terrified, and blames it all on Charlotte, saying she\u2019s always kissing him whether he wants to be smooched or not.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Bumble gives them a lecture on the evils of kissing and what it leads to (wickedness, if you were wondering), and then leaves an order for old Sally\u2019s coffin and marches home.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-27"}
