{"name": "Chapter 25", "summary": "Fagin\u2019s back in the old den, thinking about something in front of the fire.<PARAGRAPH>The Artful Dodger, Charley, and Chitling are playing whist (a game of cards usually played with four people), and the Dodger is surreptitiously looking at Chitling\u2019s hand.<PARAGRAPH>Unsurprisingly, the Dodger wins every time.<PARAGRAPH>Chitling has finally had enough, and seems amazed at the Dodger\u2019s luck.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin is less amazed.<PARAGRAPH>After killing time for a while, the Dodger asks Chitling why he seems so down.<PARAGRAPH>Before Chitling can answer, the Dodger asks Fagin and Charley for their opinion.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin diplomatically declines to answer, but Charley thinks it\u2019s because Chitling\u2019s in love with Betsy, and starts laughing like crazy because Chitling is in looooooove.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin comforts Chitling, and says that Betsy\u2019s \"a fine girl,\" and that if he does as she tells him to do, he\u2019ll be a successful thief and make his fortune.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, the reason Chitling went to jail was because he\u2019d followed Betsy\u2019s advice, but he says he\u2019d do it again if Betsy told him to.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s so angry with Charley (who continues to laugh this whole while), that he runs across the room to slug him. Charley dodges, and he hits Fagin in the chest, instead.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, the Dodger hears the bell downstairs, and grabs the candle to go see who it is.<PARAGRAPH>He comes back up and whispers to Fagin.<PARAGRAPH>Someone has come back \"alone;\" the news makes Fagin nervous.<PARAGRAPH>Charley and Chitling leave the room to make way for the \u2014it\u2019s Toby Crackit, looking rather the worse for wear.<PARAGRAPH>He won\u2019t tell them what happened until he\u2019s eaten something.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, he asks how Bill Sikes is doing.<PARAGRAPH>Obviously, Fagin and the Dodger don\u2019t know, and were expecting that Toby would.<PARAGRAPH>Toby says that the job failed, but Fagin already knew that from the newspaper (maybe that\u2019s what he was brooding about at the beginning of the chapter).<PARAGRAPH>Toby tells the story: in short, they ran away from the house, but there were dogs after them and the whole country seemed to be awake, and eventually Sikes had left Oliver alone in a ditch. Toby doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to either of them since\u2014it was each man for himself.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin yells, tears at his hair, and runs out of the house.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-25"}
