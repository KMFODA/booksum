{"name": "Chapter 52", "summary": "The chapter opens in a courtroom.<PARAGRAPH>A huge crowd is staring at \"the Jew\" at the front of the court.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s watching the jury members\u2019 facial expressions\u2014they\u2019re about to discuss amongst themselves to decide on the verdict.<PARAGRAPH>He sees people out in the gallery craning their necks to look at him, and they look at him with hate and horror.<PARAGRAPH>No one seems to feel any sympathy for him at all.<PARAGRAPH>The jury asks the judge to leave the courtroom to discuss.<PARAGRAPH>He tries to guess from their faces as they\u2019re leaving, whether they\u2019re feeling inclined to be merciful towards him or not, but he can\u2019t really tell.<PARAGRAPH>As he\u2019s waiting, he feels distant and removed from the whole process, and watches people moving around the court.<PARAGRAPH>The jury comes back in: guilty. And he\u2019ll die on Monday.<PARAGRAPH>The whole courtroom cheers.<PARAGRAPH>The judge has to put on a special black hat to issue the \"may God have mercy on your soul\" speech to the condemned man.<PARAGRAPH>The jailer leads Fagin out of the courtroom, and Fagin seems numb as he follows.<PARAGRAPH>Other prisoners have friends visiting them, and chatting through the bars\u2014but everyone there to watch him walk back to the condemned hold is there to yell names at him.<PARAGRAPH>They leave him in one of the condemned cells alone.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin sits alone and repeats the judge\u2019s sentence over and over again in his head: \"to be hanged by the neck until he was dead.\"<PARAGRAPH>He remembers all the men he\u2019d sold out who had, perhaps, sat in that very cell.<PARAGRAPH>Thinking about it in alone in the dark drives him crazy, and he starts banging against the walls and door, calling for light.<PARAGRAPH>Two guards come in\u2014one brings a candle, and the other brings in a mattress so that a guard can stay nearby, outside the door, all night.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin listens to the clock strike all the next day, and each hour is an hour less to live.<PARAGRAPH>They send in rabbis to talk to him, but he doesn\u2019t want to talk to anyone, and curses them until they leave.<PARAGRAPH>By Sunday night, he\u2019s become so horrible to be around that the two guards stay outside his door together\u2014neither of them can stand to be near him alone.<PARAGRAPH>Later that night, Mr. Brownlow and Oliver arrive at Newgate, and ask to see the prisoner.<PARAGRAPH>The guard is a little doubtful about letting Oliver in, because it\u2019s hardly a place for children. But Mr. Brownlow figures that Oliver\u2019s seen worse.<PARAGRAPH>Once they\u2019re alone with Fagin, Mr. Brownlow asks him where he\u2019d hidden the papers that Monks had given him for safekeeping.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin won\u2019t tell Brownlow, but calls Oliver over.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin mostly wants to persuade Oliver to help him escape (he seems to be slightly out of his mind), but he does tell Oliver where the papers are.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver tries to comfort Fagin and asks to pray with him, but Fagin starts shrieking and gets all clingy, and they have to skedaddle.<PARAGRAPH>The chapter ends with a crowd of people assembling to watch the hanging.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-52"}
