{"name": "Chapter 1", "summary": "It\u2019s a short first chapter, and gets right to the point: the scene is a small town in England, and the novel opens in the early nineteenth century (it was published in 1839, but takes place a little bit before\u2014probably in the late 1820s or so).<PARAGRAPH>Oliver is born in a workhouse in a town called Mudfog (in other editions, that don\u2019t use Dickens\u2019s original text, the town isn\u2019t named), and is described as a \"new burden upon the parish\" (1.1). (For more about what a \"parish\" is, check out the \"What\u2019s Up with the Title\" section).<PARAGRAPH>After kissing Oliver with \"cold white lips,\" Oliver\u2019s mother dies, leaving her son all alone and at the mercy of the parish authorities.<PARAGRAPH>All we learn about his mother at this point is that a) she was found lying in the street after having walked a long way, but nobody knows where she\u2019d come from, and b) she wasn\u2019t wearing a wedding ring, so the doctor assumes that she was unmarried and that Oliver is illegitimate, and c) she was a \"good-looking girl.\"<PARAGRAPH>Dickens hints ominously at the fate awaiting Oliver as \"a parish child\" in the closing sentences of the first chapter.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-1"}
