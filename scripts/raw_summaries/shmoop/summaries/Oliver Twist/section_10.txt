{"name": "Chapter 11", "summary": "Oliver is dragged to the magistrate, who is basically just a guy who administers justice without the inconvenience of a jury. Or fairness.<PARAGRAPH>Even though the old gentleman says he\u2019d rather not press charges (apparently he\u2019s started to feel sorry for Oliver, after watching him get dragged through the streets), the police officer says the magistrate has to see him.<PARAGRAPH>He gets thrown into a cell at the station house (this is like a Victorian county jail, as opposed to Newgate, which is like a Victorian federal prison). Dickens says the cell is \"most intolerably dirty\" because it was Monday morning, and the cell was filled with drunken people all weekend. So, basically, the police officer just threw Oliver into a cell that was covered in other people\u2019s urine and vomit.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, the old gentleman is talking to himself, wondering whether Oliver might possibly be innocent, hoping that he is, and asking himself why Oliver looks so darned familiar.<PARAGRAPH>The old gentleman is called into the presence of the magistrate, Mr. Fang.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Fang is very, very rude. He seems to enjoy getting respectable people all riled up by treating them badly, and that\u2019s just what he does with this old gentleman.<PARAGRAPH>But the old gentleman doesn\u2019t want to get Oliver into more trouble, so he tries not to lose his temper. He introduces himself, and we learn his name for the first time: Mr. Brownlow.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Brownlow tells the story of how Oliver was chased, and says that he thinks he might very well be innocent.<PARAGRAPH>When Fang turns to Oliver; Oliver\u2019s too weak to answer, but the officer leaning over Oliver to hear his response makes up answers to repeat back to Fang. Needless to say, the officer\u2019s made-up answers aren\u2019t very flattering.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver faints on the floor.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Fang says he\u2019s faking, and commits him to three months of hard labor.<PARAGRAPH>Things are looking pretty grim for poor Oliver, when the bookseller, who saw the whole thing, comes running in, demanding to be sworn in.<PARAGRAPH>The bookseller swears that he saw the robbery committed by another boy.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Fang realizes that he\u2019s coming off as a total jerk, so he pretends the whole thing is Mr. Brownlow\u2019s fault, and orders the office to be cleared before Mr. Brownlow can get a word in edgewise.<PARAGRAPH>They get cleared out of the court, and Oliver\u2019s lying there on the pavement looking half-dead, so Mr. Brownlow orders a coach to carry Oliver away.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-11"}
