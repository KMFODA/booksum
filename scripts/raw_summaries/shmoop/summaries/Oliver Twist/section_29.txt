{"name": "Chapter 30", "summary": "Rose and Mrs. Maylie still don\u2019t know that the thief is just a boy, so the doctor decides to let them look for themselves at the kind of thief they\u2019re harboring\u2014but only after assuring them that although the thief \"hasn\u2019t shaved in a while,\" he\u2019s really not so scary.<PARAGRAPH>When they get to the room, Oliver\u2019s asleep on the bed and looking totally angelic as usual.<PARAGRAPH>Rose smoothes his hair on the pillow and cries over him a bit (she\u2019s very soft-hearted).<PARAGRAPH>Rose, Mrs. Maylie, and Mr. Losberne discuss whether or not Oliver can really be a criminal.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Losberne thinks it\u2019s possible for crime and vice to take hold of a person from a very young age, and that even though Oliver looks innocent, he might really be a hardened criminal.<PARAGRAPH>Rose refuses to believe it, and begs her aunt to protect Oliver from the authorities, saying that she herself might have been an orphan all adrift in the world if Mrs. Maylie hadn\u2019t taken care of her, so could she please, please do the same for Oliver?<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Maylie promises to, and the doctor thinks about what they can do\u2014after all, the authorities have already been notified about the break-in, and the servants know all about it, so it will be difficult to keep Oliver from being arrested.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Losberne decides what to do, and gets Mrs. Maylie\u2019s permission to do as he thinks proper\u2014provided that, once they hear the boy\u2019s story, they still think that he\u2019s worth saving. Mrs. Maylie must really trust him, because she agrees to this, even though she doesn\u2019t know what his plan \nis.<PARAGRAPH>Later on in the day, Oliver wakes up and tells his story to Rose, Mrs. Maylie, and Mr. Losberne.<PARAGRAPH>They believe him, and put him to bed for the night.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Losberne goes down to the kitchen, where Mr. Giles is once again telling the story of his heroism to the other servants.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Losberne pretends to be very angry, and asks Giles and Losberne if they are Protestant\u2014they are\u2014and if they would be willing to swear up and down, on a stack of Bibles, that the boy they found on the doorstep that morning was the same as the boy they had shot the night before.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Giles and Brittles are so rattled by his unexpected tone of voice that they say they aren\u2019t sure.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, they hear a coach in the driveway.<PARAGRAPH>Brittles says it must be the two Bow-street officers that he and Mr. Giles had sent for that morning. (Bow-street officers were the detective branch of the Metropolitan police force at that point\u2014they\u2019ve since been replaced by Scotland Yard.)<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Losberne is annoyed that Giles and Brittles had sent for the officers without being asked, but he doesn\u2019t say so, and walks out of the kitchen.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-30"}
