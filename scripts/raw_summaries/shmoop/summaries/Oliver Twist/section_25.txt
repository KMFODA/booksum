{"name": "Chapter 26", "summary": "Fagin cools his pace after almost getting run over in the street, and turns and heads up to another neighborhood, where there are lots of second-hand shops where people buy and sell stolen goods. Fagin seems to know the place well.<PARAGRAPH>He sees a tradesman that he recognizes, and asks if anyone they know is up at the \"Cripples.\"<PARAGRAPH>The tradesman doesn\u2019t think Sikes is there, but Fagin heads in that direction anyway.<PARAGRAPH>The Three Cripples is the bar from Chapter Fifteen, where Sikes went after his dog with the poker. Fagin knows it well and goes right upstairs, looking for a particular person.<PARAGRAPH>There\u2019s a guy playing the piano, and a woman singing in the upstairs room, which is full of some pretty dodgy-looking characters.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin steps back out onto the landing, followed by the landlord, who asks Fagin to join them.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin asks, in a whisper, \"Is he here?\" (26.22).<PARAGRAPH>The landlord says no, and then Fagin asks after Barney\u2014he\u2019s not there, either.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin asks if he will be here later on. The landlord asks if he means Monks, and Fagin hushes him, but says yes.<PARAGRAPH>The landlord says that Monks will be coming there soon.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin seems relieved that he\u2019s not there now, and tells the landlord to send Monks to see him the next day.<PARAGRAPH>The landlord suggests that they \"sell\" Phil Barker, because he\u2019s good and drunk (i.e., sell him out to the police).<PARAGRAPH>Fagin says it\u2019s not Phil\u2019s time yet\u2014he can still be useful before they sell him out.<PARAGRAPH>They both laugh.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin then takes a cab to Sikes\u2019s house to see what Nancy knows.<PARAGRAPH>He finds her with her head on the table\u2014Fagin figures she\u2019s either drunk or miserable.<PARAGRAPH>Nancy asks if he has any news, and Fagin repeats Toby\u2019s story. Nancy doesn\u2019t respond.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin wants to know if she has any clue where Sikes might have gone. She doesn\u2019t answer, so he tries to get her to talk by reminding her about poor little Oliver.<PARAGRAPH>She says Oliver\u2019s better off dead, anyway.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin gets angry, and tells Nancy that if Sikes comes back without Oliver, Nancy had better kill him (Sikes) herself, or Fagin will have him hanged.<PARAGRAPH>Nancy\u2019s shocked, and asks what he means.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin\u2019s so worked up he lets out more than he means to: he says that Oliver is worth hundreds to him, and he doesn\u2019t want it all thrown away when he himself is bound \"to a born devil that wants only the will, and has got the power to, to\u2014\" (26.53).<PARAGRAPH>But before finishing that sentence, Fagin realizes he\u2019s said too much, and falls back in a chair, and asks Nancy if she\u2019s understood him (he still thinks she\u2019s drunk).<PARAGRAPH>Nancy just repeats that she thinks Oliver would be better off dead, so long as Bill Sikes is all right.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin asks if she minded what he\u2019d just been saying, and she says that if it\u2019s something she\u2019s supposed to do, he\u2019ll have to repeat it.<PARAGRAPH>After asking a few more questions, Fagin is satisfied that she\u2019s too far gone to remember what he accidentally let slip about being in somebody\u2019s power and about Oliver being worth so much money.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin hurries home and, as he\u2019s about to open his door, someone comes out of a dark neighboring doorway and calls to him.<PARAGRAPH>The man asks where Fagin\u2019s been all this time, and Fagin says he\u2019s been out on the man\u2019s business, and that it\u2019s nothing good.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger asks to go inside, and Fagin reluctantly brings him in.<PARAGRAPH>Monks (that\u2019s what Fagin calls him) is complaining that the whole housebreaking scheme was a mistake, and that Fagin should have made \"him\" a pickpocket instead, as he had done to so many other boys, and so gotten \"him\" (they still haven\u2019t named Oliver) sent out of the country (sometimes convicted thieves \"only\" got transported out of the country instead of hanged\u2014usually to Australia).<PARAGRAPH>Fagin defends himself by saying that \"he\" was hard to corrupt, so they needed to force him into something that they could use to frighten him later on. Anyway, he says, the worst case scenario is that he\u2019s dead, and\u2014<PARAGRAPH>But Monks breaks in and says that if the boy is dead, it\u2019s not his fault\u2014his agreement was that they could do anything, but not bring about his death, because \"it\u2019s always found out, and haunts a man besides!\" (26.95).<PARAGRAPH>Just then, Monks thinks that he sees a shadow of a woman wearing a bonnet outside the door in the hallway.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin thinks Monks is nuts, but agrees to inspect the upper rooms\u2014no one there. And besides, he\u2019d locked the house, and the only other people in it are Charley, the Dodger, and Toby, who are all asleep.<PARAGRAPH>Monks is still nervous, but tries to shrug it offand goes home.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-26"}
