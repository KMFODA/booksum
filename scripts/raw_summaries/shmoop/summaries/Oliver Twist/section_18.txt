{"name": "Chapter 19", "summary": "Fagin is walking through the streets in a seedy neighborhood of London, and walks up the steps to a house there.<PARAGRAPH>Bill Sikes meets him at the door, along with the growling dog.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin seems nervous when he sees Nancy\u2014he\u2019s afraid she\u2019ll still be mad about Oliver, and he hasn\u2019t seen her since.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes offers Fagin a drink, but Fagin hardly touches it.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes assumes it\u2019s because Fagin doesn\u2019t want to be tipsy when they talk business, because that could give Sikes the upper hand.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes glugs the brandy for him, and declares that he, at least, is now ready to talk shop.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin wants to know if everything\u2019s all set to rob a house in Chertsey (a cute little village at that time that was just outside of London).<PARAGRAPH>Sikes says sorry, but nope.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin\u2019s shocked\u2014he assumes they haven\u2019t gone about it properly.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes explains that Toby Crackit has been hanging around the place for two weeks wearing fancy clothes, trying to seduce one of the servants, but it hasn\u2019t worked. He even tried wearing a fake mustache and military trousers. No dice.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin\u2019s disappointed, and says so.<PARAGRAPH>After a few minutes\u2019 pause, Sikes says that there\u2019s still a way to break into the house from the outside (the Toby Crackit method would be to let Sikes in from the inside, after smooching with the servants), but he\u2019d need to borrow a small boy.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin guesses at the method Sikes has in mind\u2014there must be some panel that\u2019s easily lifted off the outside of the house, through which a small boy could fit and then open up the house for the men.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s on the tip of his tongue to suggest Oliver, but then Fagin remembers how upset Nancy got the last time she was around for part of Oliver\u2019s \"miseducation.\"<PARAGRAPH>Nancy insists that she\u2019s fine with it, and glugs a glass of brandy and laughs really loudly to prove it.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes isn\u2019t so sure about Oliver, since he\u2019s so inexperienced, but he is just the right size (Charley and the Dodger are too big).<PARAGRAPH>Fagin is excited\u2014he thinks Oliver\u2019s ready, and that helping to commit this one crime will make him \"ours\u2014ours for his life!\" (19.83).<PARAGRAPH>Nancy and Sikes wonder why Fagin is so obsessed with corrupting Oliver, when there are so many boys out there who would be easier to corrupt.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin seems \"confused\" at how to answer this question\u2014he stammers out that other boys\u2019 \"looks convict \u2019em when they get in trouble, and I lose \u2019em all\" (19.87).<PARAGRAPH>Fagin quickly gets himself together, and insists that Oliver\u2019s in it for good, now, because if he got caught in the act while robbing the house, he\u2019d be in the same boat with the rest of them.<PARAGRAPH>Nancy asks when it\u2019s to be done, and Sikes says the day after tomorrow.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin asks a few more logistical questions about how they\u2019re going to carry off the swag, and Sikes reassures him that it\u2019s all taken care of.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s agreed upon that Nancy will be the one to pick Oliver up before his mission, because he\u2019s more likely to trust her.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s also agreed upon that Sikes will be in total control of Oliver during the robbery, and if he decides to shoot Oliver, or if Oliver gets \"lost\" on the way, well, that\u2019s his call.<PARAGRAPH>Now that it\u2019s all arranged, Sikes starts drinking hard.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin says good night to Nancy, and gives her a hard look\u2014he clearly doesn\u2019t trust her, but she seems in perfect earnest.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin heads home, and asks if Oliver is in bed\u2014he is, and Fagin decides not to wake him up, and the chapter ends ominously, as usual, with Fagin standing creepily over the sleeping Oliver.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-19"}
