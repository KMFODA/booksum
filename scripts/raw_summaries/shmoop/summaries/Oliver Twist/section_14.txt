{"name": "Chapter 15", "summary": "The chapter opens with a lengthy digression\u2014Dickens starts out by describing (in detail) how he\u2019s not going to talk about the kinds of people who don\u2019t help the poor, and the reasons they make up to defend themselves, and he spends so much time telling us exactly what he\u2019s not going to tell us about, that by the end, he has.<PARAGRAPH>And then we\u2019re back in a public house with Bill Sikes and his dog.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes is clearly preoccupied about something, and decides to take it out on the dog, so he kicks it and swears at it.<PARAGRAPH>The dog grabs hold of his boot with its teeth, and so Sikes goes after it with the poker in one hand, and a pocketknife in the other.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin arrives just in time for the dog to make its escape out the front door.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes is angry that Fagin came between him and the dog, and Fagin tries to shrug it off.<PARAGRAPH>But then Sikes tells Fagin that he wishes Fagin had been in the dog\u2019s shoes (not that dogs wear shoes\u2026) a few minutes before. Fagin doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a very funny joke, but then, Sikes probably wasn\u2019t joking.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes tells Fagin that whatever happens to him, will happen to Fagin (in other words, if Sikes gets arrested, he\u2019s ratting out Fagin).<PARAGRAPH>Fagin agrees that they \"have a mutual interest,\" and then they get down to business (15.19).<PARAGRAPH>Fagin pays Sikes a share of money (he doesn\u2019t say what it\u2019s for), and says that it\u2019s more than it ought to be.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes looks at the amount, and clearly disagrees.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes rings a bell to call for the bartender.<PARAGRAPH>Barney (who is also Jewish, Dickens takes care to inform us) comes in to take Sikes\u2019s order.<PARAGRAPH>He and Fagin exchange glances and communicate something through it that Sikes isn\u2019t aware of.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin then asks Barney if anyone else is in the main part of the bar, and Barney tells him that no one is there but \"Biss Dadsy\" (Barney talks like he has a bad cold, apparently) (15.32).<PARAGRAPH>Sikes asks Barney to bring Nancy into the side room where they are.<PARAGRAPH>He asks her how her stalking is going, and she says it\u2019s a pain\u2014Oliver\u2019s been sick and confined to the house, so she hasn\u2019t made much headway.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin cuts her off in the middle of her story, as though he doesn\u2019t want Sikes to know too much about it.<PARAGRAPH>So Nancy changes the subject, and eventually heads out with Sikes.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver, meanwhile, is off on his errand to deliver the books to the bookseller, and he\u2019s taken a wrong turn. It\u2019s not a very wrong turn, though, and he knows it\u2019ll get him there eventually, so he doesn\u2019t turn around.<PARAGRAPH>Too bad it\u2019s a dark alley (if you\u2019re an orphan and half the bad guys in the city have it in for you, you should avoid these) and too bad he runs into Nancy and Sikes.<PARAGRAPH>Nancy\u2019s still in her \"respectable sister\" costume, and as soon as she sees Oliver she starts crying over him and pretending that he\u2019s her little lost brother who ran away from home a month ago.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s persuasive enough that everyone on the street around them starts scolding Oliver for being a bad boy, and for running away to join thieves and worrying his family like that. What a naughty boy!<PARAGRAPH>Even though Oliver loudly contradicts it all, Nancy\u2019s act is better than his\u2014everyone thinks he\u2019s just trying to lie because he\u2019s a hardened criminal and he wants to get back to his gang of thieves.<PARAGRAPH>So Nancy and Sikes drag Oliver back into the bad neighborhood they\u2019d just come from, while Mrs. Bedwin, Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Grimwig are back at the house in Pentonville wondering what\u2019s become of him.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-15"}
