{"name": "Chapter 9", "summary": "Henry walks along with the wounded regiment, wishing he had a wound too \u2013 a \"red badge of courage\" of his very own. (Aha!)<PARAGRAPH>Henry feels that his chickenness is written on his forehead\u2026 which would be quite interesting, if it were possible.<PARAGRAPH>Henry sees the worst thing he\u2019s seen yet. It\u2019s his old friend Jim Conklin (\"the Tall Soldier\") and it is apparent that Jim is in the process of dying. He\u2019s afraid of getting run over if he stays in the road and somehow runs (despite his mortal wound) to some bushes on the side of the path.<PARAGRAPH>As Henry and \"the Tattered Soldier\" watch, Jim dies a horrible, grisly, pitiful death in a scene like no other.<PARAGRAPH>Henry, angry at losing his friend, rages internally at the battle.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422200850/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/red-badge-of-courage/summary/chapter-9"}
