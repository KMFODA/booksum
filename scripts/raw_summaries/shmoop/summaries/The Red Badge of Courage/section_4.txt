He shoots and reloads like a madman. He feels as if he is a part of something large and multi-bodied (sort of like the Borg, only less Star Trek-y).<PARAGRAPH>There are many excellent descriptions of the injured dead and dying. Really gruesomely gorgeous stuff.<PARAGRAPH>When one soldier tries to run away, the lieutenant beats him up.<PARAGRAPH>When it is over, Henry feels weary, but proud at seeing the Union flag still flying.<PARAGRAPH>He is also amazed to see that the sun is still shining; that nature takes no notice of the bloody deeds done on its tranquil soil.
