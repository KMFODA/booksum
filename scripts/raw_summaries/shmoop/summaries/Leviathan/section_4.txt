We guess being a prince will only get you so far.<PARAGRAPH>While Klopp pilots the walker, Volger tells Alek that he and Alek's father made a plan in case anything happened to the archduke.<PARAGRAPH>Volger tells Alek how his parents were assassinated, a story that differs a bit from the real-life historic assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie.<PARAGRAPH>Alek is still trying to believe that Volger and Klopp have kidnapped him and his parents are still alive\u2014in other words, he's in denial.<PARAGRAPH>All of a sudden, Volger yells at Klopp to stop the engines.<PARAGRAPH>Then they feel that most ominous of ominous feelings (ask anyone in a Jurassic Park movie): the sound of something heavy moving over the ground toward them.<PARAGRAPH>Volger goes through the hatch to look out and calls to Alek to join him\u2014a German land dreadnaught (read: superwalker) is coming after them.<PARAGRAPH>Volger says that these are Alek's enemies, but Alek clings to hope that it's a rescue mission.<PARAGRAPH>That hope is quickly dashed, however, when the dreadnaught starts coming after them\u2014in the sense that it starts shooting at them.<PARAGRAPH>Alek realizes that Klopp and Volger have been telling the truth as Volger tells him this proves the Germans believe he has a claim to the throne of Austria-Hungary.
