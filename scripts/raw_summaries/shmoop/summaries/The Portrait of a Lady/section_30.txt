{"name": "Chapter 31", "summary": "Time flies \u2013 a year has passed since we last saw Isabel. The narrator fills us in on some of Isabel\u2019s activities and adventures.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel\u2019s sister, Lily, and her children came to visit Isabel in Paris and London.

Isabel is oddly glad to see them go.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel gallivants off to Greece, Turkey, and Egypt with Madame Merle for three months \u2013 of course, Isabel foots the bill. Madame Merle? Make that Madame Mooch.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel has gotten to know Madame Merle even better. She is still fond of her, though she sees that there is something still hidden in the older woman\u2019s nature.<PARAGRAPH>We learn a little more about Madame Merle\u2019s history, as Isabel has learned a little more. Madame Merle\u2019s late husband took advantage of her youth and inexperience (which is interesting, since that sounds like what Osmond would like to do). Isabel is impressed that Madame Merle still retains a zest for life.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel thinks that she and Madame Merle have different kinds of moral standards. She sees that they are different.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel stays at Madame Merle\u2019s in Rome.
