{"name": "Chapter 46", "summary": "Lord Warburton has not called or written, and Osmond, ever the pessimist, holds Isabel responsible.<PARAGRAPH>Osmond assumes that Isabel has a hand in Warburton\u2019s sudden absence, and demands that she correct it.<PARAGRAPH>At this fortuitous moment, Lord Warburton arrives at the Osmonds\u2019 and announces his departure for England.

Osmond leaves the two friends alone.<PARAGRAPH>Lord Warburton expresses his wish for Isabel to visit him in England.<PARAGRAPH>Pansy comes to bid adieu to Lord Warburton, and she is close to tears.<PARAGRAPH>As it turns out, her tears are more of relief than anything else. Pansy seems glad to be rid of Lord Warburton\u2019s questionably genuine affections.<PARAGRAPH>Osmond accuses Isabel of having played a game against him. He thinks that Isabel has worked specifically to turn Lord Warburton away from Pansy.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel appears, in her white cloak, like the angel of disdain, looking down sadly upon Osmond\u2019s petty accusations.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel suggests that Osmond should do the courtship work himself next time.<PARAGRAPH>Osmond says that there is still hope that they might still take Lord Warburton up on his offer to visit England. He also grimly notes that this affair has proved that Pansy can aim high in the marriage game.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508161644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/portrait-of-a-lady/summary/chapter-46"}
