She loves the city\u2019s rich sense of history.<PARAGRAPH>Henrietta is not that impressed with Rome, thinking that every Roman characteristic is inferior to similar ones in America. This is typical hilarious Henrietta \u2013 in fact, everything newer is modeled on the old, not vice versa.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph goes to look at an excavation site, and Isabel is glad to be alone for a little bit.<PARAGRAPH>However, she\u2019s not alone for long \u2013 shockingly (and awkwardly), Lord Warburton shows up.

He seems to want to prove that he and Isabel can be friends.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel still believes that Lord Warburton is the best kind of man, superior in every way\u2026 and, yet, she still has no romantic feelings for him.<PARAGRAPH>On Sunday, the group goes to Saint Peter\u2019s church, where they meet again with Lord Warburton.<PARAGRAPH>Once more, Henrietta ridiculously compares the architecture with American standards.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel is with Lord Warburton when she becomes aware of Gilbert Osmond standing behind her (creepy\u2026).<PARAGRAPH>Osmond makes it clear that he is there only to see Isabel.<PARAGRAPH>Lord Warburton sees the two of them talking.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel introduces Osmond and Lord Warburton to each other. Can you say \"awkward?\"<PARAGRAPH>Lord Warburton asks Ralph about Osmond. Ralph says that they must not try to prevent Isabel and Osmond\u2019s union, if they want any hope of keeping them apart. Ralph thinks that Isabel will go against their wishes in order to prove her freedom.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph tells Lord Warburton that neither of them can give Isabel what she wants, implying that, despite all his insistence to the contrary, he is in fact in love with his cousin.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508161644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/portrait-of-a-lady/summary/chapter-27"}
