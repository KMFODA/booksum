{"name": "Chapter 51", "summary": "Mrs. Touchett telegrams Isabel, notifying her of Ralph\u2019s imminent death. She asks Isabel to come to Gardencourt.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel goes to Osmond to let him know that she\u2019s going. Osmond forbids her to go.<PARAGRAPH>Osmond tells her that it would be an indecent thing to go against his wishes, as they are still a married couple, like it or not.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel wonders if he would expect her to come back if she leaves.<PARAGRAPH>Countess Gemini hears of Ralph\u2019s condition, and her first thought is that Isabel will not give any more parties when she is mourning (oh, that Countess \u2013 what a saint). Of course, Countess Gemini has been waiting for Isabel to set Osmond off, so she is excited that going to England might be it. Lest you think she\u2019s totally heartless, don\u2019t worry \u2013 she\u2019s also somewhat sympathetic to her sister-in-law.<PARAGRAPH>After pondering her options, Countess Gemini decides to play her trump card: she tells Isabel the grim truth about her brother.<PARAGRAPH>Countess Gemini tells Isabel that Pansy was not the child of Osmond\u2019s first wife. And Isabel has a good idea who Pansy\u2019s birth mother is: Madame Merle!<PARAGRAPH>Countess Gemini tells Isabel that Osmond and Madame Merle were romantically involved for six or seven years.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel, torn between revulsion and pity, actually feels bad for Madame Merle, who\u2019s had to see another woman care for her daughter.<PARAGRAPH>Countess Gemini claims that Madame Merle arranged Isabel\u2019s marriage to Osmond so that Pansy would be financially supported, and could marry well.<PARAGRAPH>Osmond and Madame Merle never married because she never had enough money for him.<PARAGRAPH>Countess Gemini says that Madame Merle has done a lot for Osmond, but Osmond has done nothing for her.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel, shocked and appalled, can only say that she must see Ralph.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508161644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/portrait-of-a-lady/summary/chapter-51"}
