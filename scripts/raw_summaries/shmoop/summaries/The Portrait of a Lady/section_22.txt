{"name": "Chapter 23", "summary": "Madame Merle returns to Palazzo Crescentini, Mrs. Touchett\u2019s home in Florence.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Merle recommends Osmond to Isabel once more, telling her of his impressive traits. She ominously tells Isabel that she should interact with more men, so that she gets \"used\" to them \u2013 that is to say, so she learns which ones to despise. Uh\u2026 huh. Okay, Madame Merle.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph takes Isabel out on the town; she\u2019s delighted with Florence. Madame Merle has been there many times before (where hasn\u2019t Madame Merle been?), and can converse with them about the city, although she does not go out with them.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel loves Mrs. Touchett\u2019s house, and thinks that it is so rich with history and tradition that it\u2019s like living in the past.<PARAGRAPH>Gilbert Osmond pays a visit to Madame Merle and Isabel.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Merle and Osmond talk for most of the time and Isabel, for once, is mostly silent.<PARAGRAPH>Osmond invites Madame Merle and Isabel to his house next week. He suggests that he would like Isabel to meet Pansy. Isabel accepts the invitation.<PARAGRAPH>After Osmond leaves, Madame Merle commends Isabel for behaving just as she should have. Condescend much?<PARAGRAPH>Isabel is duly annoyed by this comment, and Madame Merle sweet-talks her back into a good mood.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel asks Ralph about Osmond, and Ralph confesses that he doesn\u2019t know much. He suspects that there\u2019s something shady about Osmond\u2019s sister.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph recommends that Isabel follows her own instincts, and doesn\u2019t listen to people\u2019s opinions about others.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph says that, as long as Isabel is with Madame Merle, she\u2019s in good hands.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel detects the usual trace of sarcasm when Ralph talks about Madame Merle, and asks him about it.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph says that Madame Merle is too perfect and too modest for how perfect she is. Right on the dot, Ralph.<PARAGRAPH>However, despite his misgivings about Madame Merle\u2019s creepy so-called perfection, he figures that Isabel can benefit from being friends with the older woman. We\u2019ll see about that\u2026.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508161644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/portrait-of-a-lady/summary/chapter-23"}
