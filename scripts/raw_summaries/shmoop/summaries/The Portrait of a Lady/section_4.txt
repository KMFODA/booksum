{"name": "Chapter 5", "summary": "Ralph and his mother exchange pleasantries. While they chat, we find out some details on Ralph\u2019s past.<PARAGRAPH>After attending both Harvard and Oxford (his father wanted him to be both British and American), Ralph took a position at his father\u2019s bank. At university, he was considered a very promising young man. Growing up, he admired his father more than anyone else.<PARAGRAPH>Sadly, Ralph fell ill while working at the bank, and never quite recovered. As a result, he stopped working to take care of his health. We don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s wrong with him, but he has weak lungs.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph resigns himself to indifference in order to make his life seem less of a disappointment.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel\u2019s arrival, however, has gotten his blood flowing in a new way. He asks his mother what she means to do with Isabel.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Touchett plans to invite her to stay at Gardencourt for some weeks, then plans to take Isabel to France to buy clothes, and then to Florence in the autumn.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Touchett sees something special in Isabel, perhaps something that reminds her of herself. She thinks that Isabel might be a genius in some way.<PARAGRAPH>When Ralph asks too many questions about Isabel, Mrs. Touchett insists that he find out himself.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph finally straight-out asks Mrs. Touchett the question he\u2019s been wondering the whole time: does she plan to marry Isabel off? Mrs. Touchett replies that Isabel can do whatever she\u2019d like.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph escorts his mother down to meet with his father.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph sits and talks with Isabel for an hour, while his parents chat, and Lord Warburton leaves to go home for dinner.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph and Isabel look at the paintings in the house. Ralph is impressed with Isabel\u2019s natural taste for art.<PARAGRAPH>Gardencourt being a large, old, very historic house, Isabel assumes that there\u2019s a family ghost. Ralph confesses that there is one and that he has seen it, but Isabel can\u2019t, because she hasn\u2019t suffered enough yet. This conversation is half-joking, half-serious.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel insists that she is not afraid of ghosts.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph hands her a candle to light the path to her room.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph returns to the drawing-room alone.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508161644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/portrait-of-a-lady/summary/chapter-5"}
