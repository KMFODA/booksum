{"name": "Chapter 8", "summary": "The epigraph for Chapter 8, like Chapter 7, comes from John Dryden's poem \"Palamon and Arcite.\"<PARAGRAPH>The tournament continues, both in Dryden's poem and in <em>Ivanhoe</em>.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John suddenly remembers that they have yet to elect the Queen of Beauty and Love for the tournament.<PARAGRAPH>John wants to nominate Rebecca (partly to annoy off the Saxons).<PARAGRAPH>The Normans are anti-Semitic jerks and refuse.<PARAGRAPH>They decide to leave the choice of the Queen to the guy who wins the tournament.<PARAGRAPH>The first day of the tournament includes rounds of battles between individual knights to decide who is the best jouster overall.<PARAGRAPH>The second day will involve archery contests and other competitions among the common people.<PARAGRAPH>The tournament begins with heralds blowing horns and knights appearing in procession.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator says there is no point in detailing who these knights are or where they come from --they're all dead now anyway.<PARAGRAPH>The first set of five challengers appears to take on the five Norman knights (headed by Bois-Guilbert).<PARAGRAPH>The advantage stays with Bois-Guilbert and his friends throughout the first four rounds of the tournament.<PARAGRAPH>The public seems unhappy with these results, since Normans are not popular in this area.<PARAGRAPH>No one is angrier than Cedric the Saxon, who desperately wants a Saxon to come along and defeat these Norman jerks.<PARAGRAPH>Just as Cedric despairs, a knight rides up dressed in fine armor.<PARAGRAPH>The sign on his shield is of an uprooted oak tree with the Old Spanish word <em>Desdichado</em> \u2013 Disinherited, translates Scott \u2013 written underneath.<PARAGRAPH>(According to our Spanish-English dictionaries, <em>Desdichado </em>really means something like \"unfortunate\" or \"unhappy,\" so Scott's not totally on the money here.)<PARAGRAPH>The Disinherited Knight rides straight up to Bois-Guilbert and challenges him.<PARAGRAPH>In the first pass, both knights shatter their lances against one another's shields.<PARAGRAPH>In the second pass, Bois-Guilbert hits the Disinherited Knight's chest fairly.<PARAGRAPH>But the Disinherited Knight makes an even better shot by hitting Bois-Guilbert's helmet with his lance.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert falls off his horse, and the Disinherited Knight wins the match.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert is so angry that he tries to challenge the Disinherited Knight to a sword fight.<PARAGRAPH>The marshals (who are like medieval tournament referees) separate the two.<PARAGRAPH>But Bois-Guilbert promises a rematch at some other time and place, and the Disinherited Knight agrees.<PARAGRAPH>The Disinherited Knight then jousts his way through Philip de Malvoisin, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, Hugh de Grantmesnil, and Ralph de Vipont.<PARAGRAPH>The Disinherited Knight wins the day.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200924210424/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-8"}
