{"name": "Chapter 39", "summary": "For this chapter Scott gives us two lines from \"Song (From thy waves, stormy Lannow, I fly),\" by Anna Seward. Scott makes a slight change: the original poem goes, \"<em>Ah nymph,</em> unrelenting and cold as thou art,\" while Scott's version is \"<em>O maid, </em>unrelenting and cold<em>...\"</em> He presumably makes this change because Rebecca <em>is </em>a maid (an old-fashioned word for girl, especially a virgin girl), not a nymph, which is a woman-shaped spirit of nature. The speaker of the poem is resentful of the girl in question. She is behaving coldly, but the speaker has pride, too.<PARAGRAPH>As the chapter starts out, Rebecca is singing a song in Hebrew.<PARAGRAPH>Her song is all about the importance of humility and accepting God's will.<PARAGRAPH>When she finishes her song, there's a knock on the door. It's Brian de Bois-Guilbert.<PARAGRAPH>He promises that he won't hurt her.<PARAGRAPH>He also tells her that there are guards nearby who will save her if he tries to harm her again.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert reminds Rebecca that she is condemned to die by torture.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca reminds him that that's his own fault.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert swears that it wasn't his choice. He wants to protect her as he defends himself.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca doesn't want his protection if it means giving up her chastity to him.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert confirms that the scroll suggesting trial by combat came from <em>him</em>.<PARAGRAPH>His original intention was to appear as her champion, to prove her total innocence.<PARAGRAPH>Now he's in a tough position. If he doesn't appear on behalf of the Templars, he'll be disgraced. But if he does appear, he will win and Rebecca will die.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert is willing to give up his place among the Knights Templar, which is so important to him, if Rebecca will consent to be his lover.<PARAGRAPH>He suggests that they run away to Palestine, where he has friends. The Muslims of Palestine are less bigoted than the English, and they won't care as much about a Christian and a Jew living together.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca answers that this is all a silly fantasy. It would be much more practical for Bois-Guilbert to go to King Richard I to ask him to help her.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert is willing to leave the Knights Templar, but he won't betray them like that.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca says that, in that case, there's nothing more to be said. Bois-Guilbert should leave now.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert is heartbroken. He wishes Rebecca were a Christian, or that he were a Jew, so they could be happy together.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert asks if they can part as friends.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca forgives Bois-Guilbert for his bad treatment of her.<PARAGRAPH>Next door to Rebecca's cell, Albert is waiting for Bois-Guilbert. He asks if Bois-Guilbert is okay.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert admits that he wants to go to Beaumanoir and refuse this trial by combat.<PARAGRAPH>Albert points out that Bois-Guilbert would ruin himself <em>and </em>would not be able to save Rebecca, who is still condemned.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert's natural arrogance takes over. He remembers that Rebecca rejected his offer of love.<PARAGRAPH>He also starts to think of himself as nothing more than a tool of fate.<PARAGRAPH>So Bois-Guilbert agrees to fight for the Templars against Rebecca's champion in the trial by combat the next day.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200924210424/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-39"}
