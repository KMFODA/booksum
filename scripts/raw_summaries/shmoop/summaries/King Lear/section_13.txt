Cue the evil smirk and hand-rubbing gesture.<PARAGRAPH>He has told Cornwall about his father's forbidden allegiance to Lear and has also showed Cornwall the incriminating, anti-Cornwall letter. (Remember the letter Gloucester showed Edmund back in Act 3, Scene 3?)<PARAGRAPH>Edmund humbly suggests that he's made a great sacrifice by placing his loyalty to Cornwall above his filial duty (to his father, Gloucester).<PARAGRAPH>Cornwall concludes that it now seems like Edgar's \"plot\" to kill his father was kind of just, what with Gloucester being such wicked guy and all.<PARAGRAPH>Edmund holds up the incriminating letter and says something like: \"It's just so awful that I have to tell on my own father, who is clearly a spy and informant for France.\"<PARAGRAPH>Cornwall says that whether the letter is true or false doesn't matter. Edmund has shown great loyalty, so he's going to be the new Earl of Gloucester either way.<PARAGRAPH>Cornwall sends Edmund off to find Gloucester and bring him back for punishment.<PARAGRAPH>Edmund hopes that when he finds his father, the man will be comforting Lear, because then Gloucester will be doubly implicated for crimes.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115185354/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/king-lear/summary/act-3-scene-5"}
