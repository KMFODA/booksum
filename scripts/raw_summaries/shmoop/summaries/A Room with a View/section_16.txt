{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 17", "summary": "This chapter details the somewhat awkward breakup of Lucy and Cecil. Surprisingly, Cecil takes it well. So well, in fact, that Lucy is irritated.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy allows herself to get upset, and, seeking an argument, attacks Cecil\u2019s attitude and opinions directly. At this last desperate moment, he actually feels something real and legitimate for Lucy \u2013 but it\u2019s too late.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy repeats George\u2019s anti-Cecil argument to Cecil himself, almost word for word. He is awestruck.<PARAGRAPH>Cecil finally realizes that his approach to Lucy and to women in general has been wrong all along. He apologizes for the wrongs he\u2019s done to her, then says that it\u2019s as though a new voice is speaking through her tonight. He\u2019s actually right \u2013 it\u2019s George\u2019s voice.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy is hyper-sensitive to this fact, and she immediately thinks he\u2019s accusing her of finding another man. She jumps down Cecil\u2019s throat and he apologizes. They calm down as much as possible and part civilly, even tenderly.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy, watching Cecil walk away, swears never to marry. The narrator ominously comments that Lucy has joined the ranks of those who deny themselves their true feelings\u2026like Charlotte Bartlett.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210414163441/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/room-with-a-view/summary/part-2-chapter-17"}
