{"name": "Part 1, Chapter 3", "summary": "Lucy, it turns out, is a devoted and uniquely talented pianist. We begin to suspect again that there\u2019s more to her than meets the eye. Though she\u2019s neither a flawless performer nor a dramatically passionate one, she is clearly a remarkable one. On a rainy day at the hotel, she settles in to play, and enters her own private musical world. For the first time, we see the real Lucy without the limitations of polite society.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Beebe, watching our heroine, is reminded of the first time he saw her play, when they met in Tunbridge Wells. He recalls his surprise at the extraordinary manner in which she banged out Beethoven\u2019s Opus III; he was totally blown away by the victorious and unexpected tone of her playing. Upon meeting her, though, he was perhaps disappointed to find that she was (and is still) a conventional, very pretty, \u201cundeveloped,\u201d and polite young lady. He wishes she would start living the way she plays. In the present, he makes this very same comment to Lucy.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy, back from the world of music, remembers that someone else once made the same comment about her to her mother, who doesn\u2019t feel the same way about music that her daughter does.<PARAGRAPH>After she emerges from her playing, the outside world seems particularly disorganized and dirty to Lucy. We learn that Charlotte and Miss Lavish are out having an adventure. Mr. Beebe attempts to tease out Lucy\u2019s real thoughts about music, but she instead responds with some dull and polite comments about her cousin and Miss Lavish. The Lucy of the piano is already gone.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Lavish, apparently, is a wannabe novelist (we can just imagine what kind of books she would write). She is in the midst of a novel about modern Italy, for which she is presumably doing research now.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Beebe is fascinated by the close relationship between Charlotte and Miss Lavish, who are complete opposites. Despite her annoyance at finding Lucy deserted and Baedeker-less in Santa Croce, Charlotte forgave the irresponsible novelist, and now they\u2019re totally BFFs. He wonders if Italy has changed Charlotte \u2013 he loves observing ladies and their behavior, though he is, we learn, simply \u201cinterested,\u201d not personally affected by women, if you catch our drift.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Catherine Alan, one of the genteel spinster tourists staying at the hotel, appears and complains about the bad weather. Of course, she phrases it in a much more polite fashion, but you get the picture. She compliments Lucy on her playing. Mr. Beebe makes a sarcastic and sublimely British comment about the general badness of Italians. Miss Alan doesn\u2019t quite get what he\u2019s going for, but knows that she\u2019s being amiably mocked. This reminds her that her sister, who she\u2019s traveling with, is unsettled by Mr. Beebe\u2019s sense of humor and all around niceness \u2013 after all, nobody expects a clergyman to be a regular person.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Alan discovers Miss Lavish\u2019s cigarette case, which she was searching for earlier. Some comments are made about Miss Lavish\u2019s naughty smoking habit (just tobacco, friends, nothing to wonder about here). Miss Alan excuses it as a consequence of losing her first draft of her novel; after it was swept away on a beach, she was \u201ctempted\u201d into smoking in her period of depression. Interesting explanation\u2026<PARAGRAPH>We hear a little bit about Miss Lavish\u2019s new novel, which is about contemporary Italy. Miss Alan, though she doesn\u2019t approve of the novelist, is very charitable about her.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Alan starts in on a somewhat less charitable story about the Emersons\u2019 arrival at the hotel, and Miss Lavish\u2019s reaction to them. Mr. Beebe, knowing that a sensitive topic is coming up, politely leaves the room.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Alan\u2019s story is a pretty hilarious one, though to her it\u2019s very serious. It goes a little like this: on the first night of the Emersons\u2019 stay, Mr. Emerson made a comment to some lady about how she should be careful about drinking too much lemonade, since it might upset her stomach. Horror of horrors! Shock of shocks! Mr. Emerson actually came right out and said \u201cstomach!\u201d And to a lady! Everyone was horrified. Ridiculous though it may seem to the modern reader (or to the readers of Forster\u2019s time, even), \u201cstomach\u201d is apparently just not a word that one says in polite company. Miss Alan is so embarrassed by it that, throughout the rest of the story, she has to refer to it as \u201cS.\u201d (hence the title of the chapter). Miss Lavish, however, was not shocked by the use of \u201cS.\u201d at the dinner table \u2013 rather, she was fascinated by the old man\u2019s plain-speaking. She then made the mistake of insulting Queen Victoria and the stuffy manner of the generation of \u201cEarly Victorians\u201d (many of whom were present at the dinner table). After dinner, things just got worse \u2013 Miss Lavish actually followed the men into the smoking room to attempt to talk to Mr. Emerson, another thing that is just not done. She was mysteriously ejected from the lair of the men, and acted like nothing happened.<PARAGRAPH>Back to the present \u2013 Lucy is fascinated. She again wants to know if Mr. Emerson is nice or not nice. Mr. Beebe thinks he\u2019s fine, albeit occasionally silly (like the best people, in our opinion!). Miss Alan, though, is sure that the Emersons are definitely not nice, despite some incident with violets that the clergyman alludes to (that we don\u2019t find out about).<PARAGRAPH>We discover that, despite Mr. Beebe\u2019s efforts to make the Emersons socially acceptable, the rest of the guests have flat out rejected them. Leading the way in the anti-Emerson faction are Miss Lavish, who represents intellectuals everywhere, and Miss Alan and her sister, representing the well-bred everywhere. Mr. Beebe suspects that Lucy is the only other person interested in the father and son, but he\u2019s worried that they might interest her too much.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Alan makes a snide comment about the Emersons being on another \u201clevel\u201d (social? intellectual? moral? All of the above) \u2013 presumably a lower one. A much lower one.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Beebe thinks that the Emersons have been conquered by the other guests\u2019 attitudes. He decides to try and come up with some kind of nice outing for the father-son dynamic duo, perhaps with Lucy and some other guests.<PARAGRAPH>The weather improves as the evening wears on, and though Miss Alan declares that it\u2019s too late to leave the hotel (something she\u2019s actually relieved about), Lucy decides to go out alone. The two older people disapprove, even Mr. Beebe. Lucy agrees to stay on streets with lots of tourists, to make her companions happy. Mr. Beebe blames Beethoven\u2019s influence for Lucy\u2019s wild behavior.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210414163441/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/room-with-a-view/summary/part-1-chapter-3"}
