{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 16", "summary": "Lucy realizes that Charlotte told Miss Lavish about the kiss, and confronts her cousin about it.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte, embarrassed and upset, admits that she did. Lucy tells her about Kiss #2, then asks Charlotte for help talking to George. This time, though, Charlotte lamely backs out \u2013 feeling helpless and exposed, she asks Lucy to do it herself.<PARAGRAPH>George comes in soon enough, and though Lucy attempts to send him away, he stays. Impassioned, he clearly outlines all of the reasons Lucy can\u2019t marry Cecil (in short, he\u2019s a misogynistic prig, which we already knew).<PARAGRAPH>George ends by declaring his love for Lucy, which, he\u2019s certain, is \u201cbetter\u201d and more sincere than Cecil\u2019s love for her. He even appeals to Charlotte for assistance, and is met with silence.<PARAGRAPH>Thus rejected, he leaves.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy and Charlotte give the situation a short debriefing, then attempt to go about their business.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy, however, is plagued by what George said about Cecil. She realizes that she\u2019s been blind all along, and breaks off her engagement.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210414163441/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/room-with-a-view/summary/part-2-chapter-16"}
