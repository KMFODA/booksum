{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 8", "summary": "Next, we find ourselves at Windy Corner, Lucy\u2019s home back in England. Some time has passed, but we\u2019re not sure how much. We are introduced to Freddy (Lucy\u2019s brother) and Mrs. Honeychurch, \u201ctwo pleasant people.\u201d Freddy, who is kind of an odd duck, is examining a bone and an anatomy book, while his mother is engaged in a more conventional pursuit \u2013 she\u2019s writing a letter. Both are spying on events going on outside the house; the curtains are drawn (to save the new carpet from the sun), but Mrs. Honeychurch can\u2019t help peeking out.<PARAGRAPH>We gather that the spectacle outside is provided by Lucy and someone named Cecil, who is apparently proposing marriage to her for the third time. Lucy has been busy since last we saw her.<PARAGRAPH>The much-refused Cecil is actually Cecil Vyse \u2013 as you may recall, the Vyses were the family Lucy and Charlotte went to visit in Rome after their disastrous departure from Florence.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Honeychurch\u2019s letter is to Mrs. Vyse, on the topic of their children\u2019s potential marriage. She and Freddy launch into a discussion of Cecil \u2013 do they or don\u2019t they like him? Mrs. Honeychurch does (or at least she likes his qualifications\u2026 he\u2019s clever, rich, and well-connected which, in those days, was good enough for anyone). Freddy admits that he\u2019s basically told Cecil that he doesn\u2019t like him. Freddy can\u2019t explain just why, but he has a new mistrust of Cecil, partially based on a comment made by Mr. Beebe regarding Cecil\u2019s \u201cdetached\u201d nature.<PARAGRAPH>Freddy, by the way, is hilarious. He\u2019s a total goofball, even when he\u2019s trying to be serious. For example, when trying to think of the reasons for his dislike of Cecil, he comes up with things like \u201cCecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellow\u2019s cap.\u201d Goofy though he may be, we get the feeling that Freddy\u2019s judgments are quite apt.<PARAGRAPH>Mother and son discuss the letter to Mrs. Vyse some more, but are interrupted by Cecil himself. He\u2019s described as mediaeval and \u201cGothic\u201d-looking, i.e., lean and austere. He already doesn\u2019t seem like a great match for Lucy, who refused to identify with the mediaeval woman in Chapter Four.<PARAGRAPH>Cecil pretentiously tells them (in Italian) that Lucy has agreed to marry him; when this is met with blank stares, he tells them in English as well.<PARAGRAPH>After the first burst of congratulations, the conversation flags. Mrs. Honeychurch starts to get sentimental, and stops herself \u2013 she hates soppiness. Again, we get the feeling that the Honeychurches as a unit are somewhat quirky but charming.<PARAGRAPH>Cecil starts giving orders, sending Lucy to tell her family about the engagement, and settling in to write his own letter to Mama Vyse.<PARAGRAPH>Left to his own devices, Cecil quickly makes us dislike him for the same ambiguous reasons Freddy doesn\u2019t like him. He remembers his attraction to Lucy, which in turn we see through his mind\u2019s eye. They\u2019d known each other for some time, but he only began to see her as interesting when they met up in Rome \u2013 could it be that her experiences in Florence made her develop into something more interesting and unusual than the \u201ccommonplace\u201d girl she was before? He now sees her as something artistic and reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s paintings. Cecil\u2019s feelings are theoretically romantic\u2026 however, he\u2019s quickly distracted by looking at the room and evaluating its potential. He\u2019s clearly judgmental of the Honeychurches and their unusual ways, and thinks about what he will do with the furnishings when he\u2019s in charge of Windy Corner.<PARAGRAPH>Cecil writes a quick letter to his mother. The sight of Mrs. Honeychurch\u2019s letter reminds him that he\u2019s getting Lucy\u2019s family along with Lucy; he\u2019s not crazy about this idea, and resolves to introduce Lucy to a new social circle ASAP.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Beebe stops in for a visit \u2013 remember, he recently moved to the parish of Summer Street. Nobody in this book ever really disappears; instead, characters pop up again and again.<PARAGRAPH>Cecil and Mr. Beebe have an awkward conversation about local happenings. Mr. Beebe brings up Cissie and Albert, which are not people, but cottages. Cecil is uninterested.<PARAGRAPH>When asked what his profession is, Cecil states that he has none \u2013 and that this is another example of his decadence. We think it\u2019s just another example of his pretentiousness.<PARAGRAPH>Cecil then simultaneously compliments and puts Freddy down for his \u201chealthiness.\u201d He realizes that he\u2019s being kind of lame, and attempts to change the conversation for the better.<PARAGRAPH>Both clergyman and fianc\u00e9 perk up when they discuss Lucy. Cecil wants to know Mr. Beebe\u2019s opinion of Lucy in Florence and at home; Mr. Beebe, creative as ever, shares the image of Lucy as a kite and Charlotte holding the string to keep her from drifting away. Cecil announces that the string has been broken \u2013 they are engaged. We have to wonder if the string is actually broken, or if it\u2019s just been handed over to Cecil.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Beebe is disappointed, for reasons not entirely known to us (or to him).<PARAGRAPH>The camaraderie the two men shared just a moment ago while discussing Lucy is gone. Cecil is reminded of the fact that he doesn\u2019t like parsons; Mr. Beebe, on the other hand, clearly doesn\u2019t like Cecil.<PARAGRAPH>Thankfully, the Honeychurches return before any further awkward conversation can take place. The mood lightens, more congratulations are dispensed, and the chapter ends with a somewhat self-consciously merry tea party.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210414163441/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/room-with-a-view/summary/part-2-chapter-8"}
