{"name": "Part 1, Chapter 1", "summary": "Lucy Honeychurch, a young Englishwoman, and her cousin/traveling companion Charlotte Bartlett, a not-so-young Englishwoman, are in Florence, Italy. They are disappointed in their lodgings at a hotel called The Bertolini, which, despite its promising name, is run by a Cockney (a working-class Londoner) landlady. Of particular disturbance is the fact that their rooms have no view of the Arno River, something they had specifically requested when booking accommodations.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte is bothered by the rooms-without-views situation, while Lucy is dismayed to find the hotel entirely populated by genteel English tourists much like themselves, with not a single real live Italian in sight. They\u2019re also at dinner eating what sounds like a very unpleasant meal, which can\u2019t possibly improve anyone\u2019s mood.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy and Charlotte clearly have something of a polite but occasionally difficult relationship. Charlotte is a poor relation, and Lucy\u2019s mother gave her some financial assistance for the trip \u2013 a fact she can\u2019t let Lucy forget. Charlotte has a special way of making Lucy feel guilty.<PARAGRAPH>The two cousins argue a little louder than ladies should (hey, they\u2019re tired and cranky). Their neighbors at the dinner table notice; an \u201cill-bred\u201d man offers to trade his and his son\u2019s rooms (with views) so that the ladies will be able to see the river.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte is not amused.<PARAGRAPH>The offer to exchange rooms with strangers (especially male strangers!) is positively unheard of. Everyone at the table is shocked, especially Charlotte. Lucy tries to be nice about it, but Charlotte \u201crepresses\u201d her.<PARAGRAPH>The ill-bred older man and his son, George, keep insisting upon the exchange. Charlotte is upset, while Lucy is \u201cperplexed;\u201d she has the feeling that the argument isn\u2019t just about rooms, but hints at something else. Keep thinking about that \u201csomething else\u201d as the book goes on \u2013 it\u2019ll come into focus eventually.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte is in such a tizzy that she attempts to leave with dramatic haughtiness. As she announces that they will leave the hotel the next day, the two ladies see a familiar face: Rev. Mr. Beebe, a clergyman on holiday that they know from England. Now there\u2019s no question of leaving the hotel; the women decide to stay.<PARAGRAPH>We learn that Mr. Beebe, who the two ladies met at Charlotte\u2019s church in Tunbridge Wells (a somewhat dreary small city in the south of England), will be taking over the parish in Lucy\u2019s neighborhood, Summer Street.<PARAGRAPH>The trio makes small talk; Mr. Beebe thinks to himself that he prefers talking to Lucy, and gives her some advice for her first visit to Florence.<PARAGRAPH>The rest of the table, headed by a talkative \u201cclever lady,\u201d takes up this conversation, and everyone puts in their two cents about where Lucy ought to go (kindly and politely, of course).<PARAGRAPH>George and his father aren\u2019t part of this conversation; it\u2019s obvious that the rest of the guests don\u2019t approve of them. Lucy briefly wishes they did, and offers them a little bow as she leaves the table. George sees it and smiles mysteriously in return.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy follows Charlotte out of the dining room, and encounters her disturbingly Cockney landlady again. She wonders if they\u2019re really in Italy at all.<PARAGRAPH>In the drawing room, Charlotte is \u201ctalking to\u201d (rather, pestering) Mr. Beebe again. She asks him about the man who offered his rooms to them.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Beebe confirms that he knows the man, Mr. Emerson, and is friendly with him. Charlotte, attempting to be coy, says she won\u2019t say anything else about him. She obviously wants the clergyman\u2019s opinion, though, and when pressed, she explains her logic on not taking the rooms \u2013 she\u2019s worried about being \u201cunder an obligation\u201d to Mr. Emerson and his son.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Beebe suggests that Mr. Emerson wasn\u2019t trying to take advantage of the two ladies, and that he was actually trying to be polite, not improper. Unlike the rest of society, Mr. Emerson apparently only says exactly what he means (imagine that!).<PARAGRAPH>This makes Lucy happy \u2013 she\u2019s glad to hear that Mr. Emerson is as nice as she\u2019d hoped he\u2019d be.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Beebe, despite Mr. Emerson\u2019s lack of tact and manners, likes the old man, even if he disagrees with him on just about every topic.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte (very seriously) comes to the conclusion that Mr. Emerson and his son are Socialists; Mr. Beebe, containing his laughter, agrees. This seems to explain everything to Charlotte.<PARAGRAPH>With the mystery of the Emersons solved, Charlotte worries that perhaps she should have taken up their offer. She assumes that Mr. Beebe has been judging her for not accepting. She hopes she hasn\u2019t been \u201cnarrow-minded and suspicious\u201d (which, of course, she has been).<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Beebe assures Charlotte that she has not; with that, he leaves. Charlotte hopes she hasn\u2019t bored Mr. Beebe, which of course she has.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy and Charlotte discuss Mr. Beebe\u2019s many qualities. Lucy praises him, saying that he\u2019s not at all like a clergyman (rather a funny comment \u2013 what she means is that he doesn\u2019t have any of the pretenses of a regular reverend).<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte makes a passive aggressive comment about how Lucy, her mother, and her brother Freddy live in the \u201cfashionable world,\u201d while she lives in dull Tunbridge Wells, which is \u201chopelessly behind the times.\u201d<PARAGRAPH>Lucy feels like Charlotte disapproves of something, but she can\u2019t put her finger on what it is.<PARAGRAPH>Again, Charlotte makes Lucy feel guilty through her intense passive aggression. Lucy feels bad about Charlotte\u2019s relative poverty.<PARAGRAPH>One of the other guests (one of several little old ladies) interrupts this uncomfortable exchange. They discuss how sad it is that Mr. Emerson didn\u2019t make his offer more delicately, since Lucy and Charlotte\u2019s rooms are so unsatisfactory. The trio has an awkward philosophical discussion about beauty versus delicacy. Charlotte thinks the two are the same thing, but Lucy has the nagging feeling that they\u2019re not.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Beebe returns, all excited. He\u2019s talked with Mr. Emerson, and has resolved the room dilemma delicately, by anyone\u2019s standards. Lucy\u2019s overjoyed that everything is working out, but Charlotte, predictably, makes herself a martyr, and succeeds in making everyone feel bad. She unwillingly (and obnoxiously) consents to the Emersons\u2019 offer. She stuffily directs Mr. Beebe to bring Mr. Emerson to her so she can \u201cthank\u201d him herself. We\u2019re already getting sick of Charlotte and her attitude by this point.<PARAGRAPH>George comes to accept the cousins\u2019 thanks, saying that his father is in the bath. This bluntness shocks even Charlotte, and her \u201cbarbed civilities\u201d don\u2019t get anywhere. Mr. Beebe and Lucy are secretly pleased. George 1, Charlotte 0. We\u2019re pleased, too.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually everyone is ready for the big room swap. Charlotte, of course, says she will take care of everything. Her perseverance and so-called unselfishness amazes us\u2026 but not in a good way. Lucy attempts to feel amazed positively, but can\u2019t quite muster it up. She wonders if perhaps Charlotte\u2019s actions could be a little less delicate and more beautiful.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte has taken the bigger room, but for a strictly moral reason, of course. She\u2019s certain that since George previously inhabited the room, Lucy shouldn\u2019t. She decorously insists that Lucy\u2019s mother wouldn\u2019t be happy if she knew that Lucy was staying in a room that a boy had been in\u2026 if you haven\u2019t noticed, some things have changed since Forster\u2019s time.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy\u2019s pretty sure that her mother wouldn\u2019t mind, but she still has a lingering feeling that something\u2019s vaguely wrong.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte envelops Lucy in a \u201cprotecting\u201d hug \u2013 to Lucy, it feels more suffocating than protective. After Charlotte leaves, her young cousin opens the window and breathes in the clean night air, thinking about Mr. Emerson\u2019s kindness.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte, in her own spacious room, discovers an unsettling object: George has left a mysterious decoration. On the wall, she sees a sheet of paper with a giant question mark on it. The symbol quickly goes from meaningless to horrifying in her mind, so she immediately takes it down and puts it away to give it back to George.
