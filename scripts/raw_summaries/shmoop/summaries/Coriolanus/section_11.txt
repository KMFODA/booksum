On the other hand, he's way too proud and hates the \"common people.\"<PARAGRAPH>One of the Officers points out that plenty of politicians hate the commoners but they're good at flattering voters. The only difference is that Coriolanus refuses to pander.<PARAGRAPH>The Senators show up and get down to business. It's official: Coriolanus is running for \"consul.\"<PARAGRAPH>Cominius gets up and gives a big speech. Mostly, he fanboys about Coriolanus' bravery in battle.<PARAGRAPH>Coriolanus is so embarrassed that he leaves the room, but the Senators can't get enough and say they want to make him consul.<PARAGRAPH>Next step is for Coriolanus to get the plebes' votes. This involves wearing a special toga, getting \"naked,\" and showing the people his war wounds.<PARAGRAPH>Hey, it's tradition.<PARAGRAPH>Coriolanus is  not happy about this, but he promises the Senate he'll do it anyway.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone exits except Sicinius and Brutus.<PARAGRAPH>After talking more smack about Coriolanus, they decide to bad mouth him to the Citizens.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200921130811/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/coriolanus/summary/act-2-scene-2"}
