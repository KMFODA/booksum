{"name": "Act II, Scene vi", "summary": "Back at Mount Misenum, in southern Italy, Pompey\u2019s crew has just walked in to meet with the triumvirate and attendants. They\u2019re ready to do some old-school negotiating before they fight. Caesar refers to a letter the triumvirs sent that outlines some terms the enemies can discuss.<PARAGRAPH>Pompey points out he\u2019s fighting to avenge the death of his father.<PARAGRAPH>(A history lesson: Pompey (the elder) was defeated by Julius Caesar and had to flee to Egypt, where he was murdered.)<PARAGRAPH>Ignoring this, Antony points out that although Pompey\u2019s force at sea is masterful, Rome\u2019s land forces far outweigh Pompey\u2019s.<PARAGRAPH>Pompey knows they're right about his troops being out of their league on land, and when pressed, he goes over the terms that have been offered. The triumvirs have said that Pompey can have Sicily and Sardinia if he rids the sea of pirates and sends wheat to Rome on occasion. (Remember with Pompey\u2019s sea control, he strangled shipping lanes, so goods to Rome were blocked. Hungry Romans = angry Romans.)<PARAGRAPH>Pompey is ready to agree to the terms except for one little thing. It seems that he entertained Antony\u2019s mom in Sicily while Caesar and Antony\u2019s brother Lucius was at war. Pompey just wants his generosity to be acknowledged.<PARAGRAPH>Antony apologizes and admits he owes Pompey some big thank yous. Thousands of lives are saved and war is averted.<PARAGRAPH>They shake on it, and agree to feast together, but not before Pompey gets in a few jibes at Antony about how being with Cleopatra means that he\u2019s getting Julius Caesar\u2019s sloppy seconds.<PARAGRAPH>Enobarbus, Antony\u2019s friend and confidante, stops the joking around before someone gets their throat cut, and they all go carousing on Pompey\u2019s ship.<PARAGRAPH>Menas, Pompey\u2019s friend, and Enobarbus, from Antony\u2019s camp, are left alone to discuss the newly made truce. They\u2019re friends, though they admit there\u2019s a little edge to this whole affair. Pompey the elder would never have done what Pompey the younger has done. Having made this compromising pact, the younger Pompey can kiss his good fortune goodbye. You weren\u2019t supposed to make nice with the enemy, it seems. It wasn\u2019t the manly, Roman thing to do.<PARAGRAPH>They then discuss how Antony has married Octavia, which was clearly for political purposes, as Octavia is a quiet and cold, especially compared to the sultry Cleopatra waiting in Egypt.<PARAGRAPH>Enobarbus predicts that, rather than seal the bond between Antony and Caesar, the marriage will ruin any goodwill between the men because there's no way that Antony will remain faithful to Octavia. Antony\u2019s inevitable betrayal of Octavia is bound to anger Caesar.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116191009/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/antony-cleopatra/summary/act-ii-scene-vi"}
