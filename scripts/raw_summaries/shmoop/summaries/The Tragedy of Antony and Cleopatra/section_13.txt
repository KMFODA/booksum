{"name": "Act III, Scene ii", "summary": "Back at Caesar\u2019s house in Rome, Enobarbus and Agrippa talk while the rest of the group work out the details of the truce and its aftermath: Pompey has already left, Antony will take Octavia and go back to Athens, Caesar is sad to see them go, and Lepidus is pitifully hung over.<PARAGRAPH>Enobarbus and Agrippa go back and forth, gently mocking Lepidus about whether he loves Antony or Caesar better. They decide he\u2019s the beetle in the center, and the other two men his wings on either side. Clearly, Lepidus is a joke.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, Lepidus, Antony, Caesar, and Octavia enter the scene. They\u2019re about to say their big goodbyes before they part ways, and Caesar bids Antony to take care of his sister, whose love will seal the bond between the two men.<PARAGRAPH>Octavia bids her brother a teary goodbye, and asks to speak to him in his ear. Hearing her words, Enobarbus and Agrippa worry Caesar will cry, as he wept at Philippi over Brutus. Instead, Caesar responds to Octavia\u2019s secret plea that he\u2019ll think of her and be in touch often.<PARAGRAPH>Caesar gives the couple a final blessing, and all exit.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116191009/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/antony-cleopatra/summary/act-iii-scene-ii"}
