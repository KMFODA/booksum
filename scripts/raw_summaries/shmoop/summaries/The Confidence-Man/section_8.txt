Yeah. And he's none too pleased about it, either.<PARAGRAPH>Tassel figures Weeds must have disembarked. College kid figures it's good riddance.<PARAGRAPH>Tassel wishes he could have caught Weeds before he left. His company\u2014the Black Rapids Coal Company, to be exact\u2014made a lot of money recently, and he wants to pay it forward.<PARAGRAPH>Hold the phone. College kid's interest is piqued. If Tassel is selling, he's buying.<PARAGRAPH>There's a lot of back and forth here that basically amounts to this: Buying; really? Yes; gimmie.<PARAGRAPH>The two also talk about gloomy philosophers ruining everything with their downer attitudes. Tassel blames them for the fact that popular opinion has lost confidence in the stock market.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, Tassel and the college kid go into a side room, then come back ostensibly having struck a deal. All we can say is, secrets don't make friends.<PARAGRAPH>When they come back, Tassel tries to get the college kid to invest in a new development called \"New Jerusalem.\" College kid is not interested.<PARAGRAPH>Tassel brings up Weeds again.
