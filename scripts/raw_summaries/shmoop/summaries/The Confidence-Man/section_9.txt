{"name": "Chapter 10", "summary": "The cabin on the ship\u2014unlike the one in the woods\u2014is where you go to play cards.<PARAGRAPH>The room is filled with people and papers\u2014pamphlets containing poetry, to be exact. A silent older man passed them out earlier, and then everyone just tossed them on the floor.<PARAGRAPH>One man is reading the ode written on them about trusting your fellow man. This again?<PARAGRAPH>Apparently the guy is moved by what he reads there.<PARAGRAPH>Tassel shows up and asks this guy where the pamphlets came from. The guy has no clue.<PARAGRAPH>Tassel is a social bunny, and he wants to party. However, his temporary companion here doesn't play cards, drink, smoke, or tell stories.<PARAGRAPH>Tassel flutters away from that dude.<PARAGRAPH>Tassel sits down by the country merchant. This is Mr. Roberts, the guy who believed in Guinea and gave him a coin; he also believed in Weeds and gave him money after his sob story.<PARAGRAPH>Tassel and Mr. Roberts chat about the card players.<PARAGRAPH>There's a pair of young guys in cream suits each wearing a bright tie, one green and the other red. They're up against a pair of middle-aged guys all in black.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Roberts doesn't trust these guys. Tassel thinks he means the young guys, since he's apparently been judging their outfits.<PARAGRAPH>No, Roberts means the older two. He thinks they must be cardsharps out to hoodwink the younger pair.<PARAGRAPH>Tassel basically goes, Pssshhhh, nah. Everyone here is playing fair, and they could all win.<PARAGRAPH>The two of them agree to disagree.<PARAGRAPH>Tassel puts his ledger down on the seat. Mr. Roberts looks away. A+ for not being a screen-creeper, Robbie.<PARAGRAPH>Tassel leaves the ledger there and walks away. Being a good dude, Mr. Roberts grabs it and takes it to him. He can't help but note that the binding on the ledger bears the title: Black Rapids Coal Company.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Roberts is giddy. Can he has stocks?<PARAGRAPH>Tassel does not appear amused or forgiving about the fact that Mr. Roberts knows who he is and what he does. He gives him a hard time. Eventually he agrees to sell him some in another backroom deal.
