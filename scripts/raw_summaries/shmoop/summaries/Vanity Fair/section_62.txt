{"name": "Chapter 62", "summary": "A few weeks later it's the season for the British to go abroad. They apparently do this en masse every year at a particular time.<PARAGRAPH>On the ship Jos acts like a big-time traveler but gets very sick when the actual journey starts.<PARAGRAPH>They see the Bareacres family, who sit alone and talk to no one on board.<PARAGRAPH>George Jr. is having fun, running around, eating a ton of food, and generally acting like a normal little kid for once.<PARAGRAPH>After they land, Jos is obsessed with meeting the king and queen of every country they come to \u2013 which apparently is reasonably easy at this time for someone of his rank.<PARAGRAPH>Amelia loves it there. She walks around with Dobbin, who carries a little stool and sketching things for her. He plays soldiers with George Jr.<PARAGRAPH>While they are outside enjoying the weather and nature, Jos sleeps a lot.<PARAGRAPH>Dobbin takes Amelia to the opera for the first time in her life. She takes to it like a duck to water and starts to finally become at least a little bit educated and cultured.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator reveals that Dobbin a true gentleman, the only one in the novel (and one of very few in real life).<PARAGRAPH>Finally they get to Pumpernickel, a town in Germany. (Like the bread!) It's sleepy, quiet, lovely, and adorable.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly the narrator turns into an actual person and tells us that he met Dobbin, Amelia, Jos, and George Jr. in Pumpernickel while they were there.<PARAGRAPH>What on earth? It's a jarring thing, this narrator switching.<PARAGRAPH>In any case, they like the town so much that they decide to stay there for a while before continuing their trip.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201020004139/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/vanity-fair-thackeray/summary/chapter-62"}
