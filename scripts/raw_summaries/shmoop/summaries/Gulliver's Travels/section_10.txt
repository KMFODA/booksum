The Whigs supported restrictions on royal power, while the Tories wanted the conservation of the king's authority. Check out this article for more on these two political parties. Also, see our \"Character Analysis\" of the Lilliputians for a specific look at Swift, the Whigs, and the Tories).<PARAGRAPH>Gulliver gets all offended because the Brobdingnagian King uses Gulliver's account of English customs as proof of human vanity: we all think our own politics and religion are so important, but from a wider perspective, they really aren't.<PARAGRAPH>But with time, Gulliver starts to see himself more and more from the Brobdingnagian perspective: tiny and funny-looking.<PARAGRAPH>What does still really tick Gulliver off is that there is a small person (only 30 feet tall!) in the Queen's service who totally rags on Gulliver because he has finally found someone smaller than he is. This person plays a number of practical jokes on Gulliver.<PARAGRAPH>The Queen is surprised at Gulliver's fearfulness, and asks if all the people of his home country are such cowards?<PARAGRAPH>Gulliver really can't help his fears: even the Brobdingnagian insects are as large as fat birds compared to him.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210503175927/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/gullivers-travels/summary/part-2-chapter-3"}
