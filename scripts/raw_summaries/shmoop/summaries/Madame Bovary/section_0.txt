{"name": "Part 1, Chapter 1", "summary": "A nameless first-person narrator (never heard from again after this chapter) recounts the day young Charles Bovary appeared at school.<PARAGRAPH>Charles is an embarrassed, rusticated, slow, and bewildered rural fellow. Also, he\u2019s a total fashion victim.<PARAGRAPH>Charles has some difficulty managing his tragically ugly hat; the teacher and the other boys all mock him.<PARAGRAPH>The class gets even rowdier, and the teacher assigns some lines to punish them. Things quiet down, though Charles is attacked with surreptitious spitballs.<PARAGRAPH>The other boys observe the newcomer carefully. He\u2019s not terribly bright, but he\u2019s a hard worker. Next, we get some background on the Bovary family: Charles\u2019s dad is a boastful but unsuccessful businessman who pretty much fails to support his family. His poor mom, whose money sustained her husband through his attempts at finding a career, is embittered, peevish, and obsessed with her son.<PARAGRAPH>Charles received a half-hearted education, but spent most of his childhood left to his own devices, running barefoot around the village and chasing turkeys (Whoohoo!).<PARAGRAPH>Despite his lackluster upbringing, Charles\u2019s parents hope that he\u2019ll make a name for himself. After a pretty average, unmemorable time at school, they enroll him in medical school, where he begins to appreciate the finer things in life: the stereotypical temptations of wine, women, and song.<PARAGRAPH>After failing his exams once, then cramming like crazy and passing a second time, Charles manages to get certified as an officier de sant\u00e9 (health officer). This is kind of like a junior doctor; it\u2019s a guy who\u2019s not a real doctor, but is allowed to practice medicine.<PARAGRAPH>Mama Bovary is happy. She sets Charles up in a nearby town, Tostes, then marries him off to a wealthy, needy widow. You\u2019ve got to feel bad for the guy.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-1-chapter-1"}
