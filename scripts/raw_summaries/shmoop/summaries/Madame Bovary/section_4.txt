{"name": "Part 1, Chapter 5", "summary": "Next, we get a brief tour of Charles and Emma\u2019s house. It sounds pretty decent \u2013 nothing impressive, but a nice enough home for a country doctor and his wife. There\u2019s a little garden, an office for Charles (with a bunch of unopened medical books), and generally everything a typical village housewife might need.<PARAGRAPH>Emma, however, is not your typical village housewife. First of all, she notices the former Madame Bovary\u2019s bridal bouquet preserved in the bedroom \u2013 this totally doesn\u2019t fly. This relic of wife #1 is relegated to exile in the attic. After this change, Emma goes on a total renovation rampage, making changes to every aspect of the little house\u2019s d\u00e9cor.<PARAGRAPH>Charles is in heaven. He gives in to all of Emma\u2019s whims, and buys everything she wants. He\u2019s totally head over heels in love with her, and is infatuated by her beauty. Everything is perfect, as far as he\u2019s concerned, and he can\u2019t remember ever being happier. The whole world is wrapped up in Emma.<PARAGRAPH>Emma, however, isn\u2019t sure that she\u2019s so happy. She had thought herself in love before the marriage, but now conjugal life doesn\u2019t seem so blissful. She wonders if the words she\u2019s read about in books \u2013 passion, rapture, bliss \u2013 can apply to her life.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-1-chapter-5"}
