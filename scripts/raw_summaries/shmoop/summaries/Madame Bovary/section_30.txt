{"name": "Part 3, Chapter 7", "summary": "The next day, the town bailiff, Ma\u00eetre Hareng, comes to the house to make an inventory of its goods.<PARAGRAPH>After they leave, Emma and F\u00e9licit\u00e9 try not to give anything away to Charles, who is somehow still blissfully ignorant of all of this.<PARAGRAPH>The government even sent a guard to make sure Emma doesn\u2019t do a runner; he stays obediently in the attic so Charles doesn\u2019t notice.<PARAGRAPH>The next day, Emma goes to Rouen to ask everyone she knows there for money.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, she comes to L\u00e9on\u2019s house. They go to their room in the H\u00f4tel du Boulogne, where she proceeds to throw herself upon his mercy. However, he doesn\u2019t have eight thousand francs worth of mercy \u2013 who does?<PARAGRAPH>L\u00e9on attempts to tell her that things aren\u2019t as bad as she thinks \u2013 he claims that things will be fine if she pacifies Lheureux with a smaller amount, like three thousand francs. He obediently goes out for a while, supposedly looking for money somewhere, and comes back empty-handed.<PARAGRAPH>Emma, who\u2019s going off the deep-end right now, tries to force L\u00e9on to steal the money from his employer. Just when he\u2019s about to give in to her will, he remembers that his rich friend Morel will be back in town that evening \u2013 he promises to bring Emma the money the next day.<PARAGRAPH>But Emma is dubious, and L\u00e9on is uncomfortable. He was sure that Emma would believe this lie, but instead she doesn\u2019t look any better. He makes a quick exit.<PARAGRAPH>Wandering disconsolately through the town, Emma is almost run over by a passing carriage. She recognizes the man inside \u2013 it\u2019s the Viscount.<PARAGRAPH>She feels even worse than ever.<PARAGRAPH>On the way home, she encounters Homais in the Hirondelle, bringing home his wife\u2019s favorite rolls from a bakery in Rouen.<PARAGRAPH>They encounter the blind beggar, as usual. Homais is offended by this spectacle, and babbles on about what the blind man should do to cure his condition. Homais gives the beggar a coin, then actually asks for change (who does that?).<PARAGRAPH>Hivert, cruel man that he is, makes the beggar do a dog impression. Emma, full of pity and disgust, gives him a five-franc coin, all the money she has in the world. It seems like a noble gesture to her.<PARAGRAPH>Emma\u2019s feelings all desert her \u2013 she\u2019s just apathetic now. She hopes that something dramatic might occur \u2013 like Lheureux\u2019s death.<PARAGRAPH>Unfortunately, no such thing happens. Emma awakens to a commotion; a crowd is gathering in the town square where a sign has been posted. All of Emma\u2019s property is officially for sale.<PARAGRAPH>Emma and F\u00e9licit\u00e9 decide that the best course of action is to go to see Monsieur Guillaumin, the notary. It\u2019s a last ditch effort.<PARAGRAPH>The notary\u2019s house is elegant, and even in her despair, Emma notes that it\u2019s the type of house she should have.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Monsieur Guillaumin is secretly allied with Lheureux, but he lets Emma babble on about her financial troubles anyway. The notary calmly eats his breakfast while she tries to enlist his help.<PARAGRAPH>The only thing Guillaumin will accept in exchange for his help, it seems, is Emma herself. He makes a move on her as soon as she\u2019s done talking. Disgusted, she flees the scene.<PARAGRAPH>Back home, F\u00e9licit\u00e9 tries to help Emma think of people who can help \u2013 someone, anyone. Emma gives up, and imagines what she\u2019ll tell Charles when he gets home. She assumes that he will forgive her for ruining them financially \u2013 but she still doesn\u2019t forgive him for the supposed crime of ever meeting her.<PARAGRAPH>Charles returns, and Emma slips out before he sees her. She high-tails it over to Binet\u2019s, and presumably asks the tax collector if he can help (he can\u2019t).<PARAGRAPH>Two of the town\u2019s gossiping ladies, Madame Tuvache, the mayor\u2019s wife, and her friend Madame Caron, observe her, disgusted by her behavior.<PARAGRAPH>Emma, rejected by the whole town, flees to Madame Rollet\u2019s, where she has a small-scale nervous breakdown (understandably) and sends the wetnurse to see if L\u00e9on is at her house.<PARAGRAPH>In the nurse\u2019s cottage, Emma waits in vain for L\u00e9on, who never shows.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Rollet returns with bad news. L\u00e9on is nowhere to be found, Charles is crying, and everyone is looking for her.<PARAGRAPH>Emma only has one more place to go: she heads off to La Huchette to find Rodolphe, ready to giver herself to him for the three thousand francs.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-3-chapter-7"}
