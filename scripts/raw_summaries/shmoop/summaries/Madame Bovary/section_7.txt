{"name": "Part 1, Chapter 8", "summary": "The ch\u00e2teau is everything Emma could have dreamt of. It\u2019s gorgeous and extravagantly beautiful. Emma is profoundly impressed by the whole thing and notices every detail.<PARAGRAPH>At dinner, Emma sees that many of the ladies take wine at dinner (putting one\u2019s glove in one\u2019s wineglass means \"No thanks,\" and in the circles Emma grew up in, women just don\u2019t drink).<PARAGRAPH>Emma is fascinated by an old, unattractive man, the Duc de Laverdi\u00e8re; rumor has it that he had been Marie Antoinette\u2019s lover.<PARAGRAPH>Emma gets her first taste of champagne, pomegranates, and pineapple. Everything here seems better than it is at home. We get the feeling that she finally feels she\u2019s getting what she deserves.<PARAGRAPH>Getting dressed for the ball, Emma and Charles have a little spat. Charles wants to dance, but Emma claims it\u2019s ridiculous, saying that people will laugh at him.<PARAGRAPH>On this night, Emma looks better than ever. Charles, taken with her beauty, attempts to kiss her, but she just shoos him away.<PARAGRAPH>The ball is like one of Emma\u2019s romantic daydreams. It\u2019s filled with beautiful women in gorgeous dresses and jewels, and \u2013 to Emma\u2019s excitement \u2013 with beautiful men, too. Everything about these gorgeous guys radiates wealth, from their clear, white complexions to their well-cut clothes.<PARAGRAPH>Emma and Charles are clearly in a brand new world. Emma sees some peasants looking in through the windows, and is reminded of her former life on the farm at Les Bertaux. These new visions of luxury and beauty totally sweep her off her feet, and she begins to wonder if she ever really was a simple country girl.<PARAGRAPH>Emma witnesses a lady and gentleman exchange a secret love note.<PARAGRAPH>Hours into the ball, a second gourmet meal is served. After this, people start to leave. By 3am, it\u2019s time for the last dance, a waltz. Emma dances with a man Flaubert simply calls the Viscount, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t really know how to waltz. She stumbles, then watches the Viscount resume the dance with another lady.<PARAGRAPH>Charles, who\u2019s been watching (but not understanding) a game of whist at the card table all night, takes Emma up to bed, complaining all the way about his tired legs.<PARAGRAPH>Emma stays up late, looking out the window and hoping to prolong her stay in this fantastical other world. Eventually she lets herself fall asleep.<PARAGRAPH>In the morning, the remaining guests eat a quick breakfast, then walk around the ch\u00e2teau\u2019s extensive grounds. Charles and Emma pack up their buggy, say their thank yous, and head back to Tostes.<PARAGRAPH>During the drive home, they encounter a party of riders on horseback. One of them, Emma thinks, is the Viscount. Shortly thereafter, Charles has to fix something on the buggy. While he\u2019s outside, he finds a green silk cigar case.<PARAGRAPH>Home again, Emma is really in a foul mood. She fires the maid, Nastasie, because dinner isn\u2019t ready on time. The word that comes to mind is \"irrational.\"<PARAGRAPH>Charles, on the other hand, is happy to be home. He\u2019s a little sad to see Nastasie go, since she\u2019s gone through a lot with him, but doesn\u2019t want to argue with his wife.<PARAGRAPH>After dinner, Charles tries to act like an aristocratic man by smoking one of the cigars he found in the silk case. Embarrassingly, he makes himself rather ill. Emma is disgusted.<PARAGRAPH>In the following days, Emma rehashes the ball over and over again in her mind. She tries to remember everything about it.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-1-chapter-8"}
