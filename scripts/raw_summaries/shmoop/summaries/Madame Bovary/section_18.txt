In the evening, Charles insists that they go get something to perk herself up from Monsieur Homais.<PARAGRAPH>While they\u2019re at the pharmacist\u2019s, they happen to run into Binet, who makes a knowing comment about the humid weather, referencing their encounter that morning in the mist.<PARAGRAPH>This alarms Emma.
