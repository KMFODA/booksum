{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 9", "summary": "Six weeks have passed since the fair. Rodolphe hasn\u2019t seen Emma again; at first, he just didn\u2019t want to show up to see her right away, and decided to go on a hunting trip. However, this trip lasted a lot longer than he\u2019d planned and, now that he\u2019s back, he\u2019s worried that he missed his window of opportunity.<PARAGRAPH>He decides to give it a shot anyway and visit Emma, hoping that absence has indeed made the heart grow fonder.<PARAGRAPH>Again, he\u2019s right. He can immediately tell that Emma\u2019s still totally into him. He plays his absence up melodramatically, claiming that he had to tear himself away from her. Rodolphe is a total drama king (and liar), and he theatrically wins Emma over with highfalutin\u2019 words and extravagant declarations of passion.<PARAGRAPH>Emma is totally swept off her feet by Rodolphe\u2019s calculated attack. She allows herself to bask in the glow of his romantic words. However, as he continues to ham it up, they hear Charles arrive at the house. The two lovers immediately switch back into polite neighbor mode.<PARAGRAPH>Rodolphe, ever the resourceful one, asks Charles if it might do Emma some good to take up horseback riding to improve her health. Of course, he will accompany her himself.<PARAGRAPH>Charles thinks this is a splendid idea, and he and Rodolphe make all the arrangements. Emma, in a contrary mood, resists \u2013 however, Charles convinces her by saying that she can order a new riding outfit.<PARAGRAPH>The next day, Rodolphe shows up promptly at noon on horseback, with a second horse in tow for Emma. After a brief warning about safety from Monsieur Homais, they\u2019re off.<PARAGRAPH>The pair ride off into the countryside. They get a good view of the village from up higher \u2013 to Emma, Yonville has never looked so small and miserable.<PARAGRAPH>They venture deeper and deeper into the forest. They dismount and Rodolphe ties up the horses so they can walk into the woods unhampered. As they go, he keeps his eyes on the sliver of white stocking that show between her skirt and boots \u2013 to him, it seems like naked skin.<PARAGRAPH>Rodolphe and Emma reach a clearing and, once they\u2019re settled down, he starts to woo her once more\u2026this time more seriously.<PARAGRAPH>Emma puts up some resistance \u2013 but not too much. She gives in to his advances and, as Flaubert says, \"abandons\" herself to him. We all know what that means.<PARAGRAPH>After the deed is done, Rodolphe and Emma head back to Yonville slowly. Everything seems different to her now.<PARAGRAPH>Rodolphe is legitimately charmed by her \u2013 after all, she\u2019s quite lovely.<PARAGRAPH>Emma feels as though everyone is looking at her as they ride through town.<PARAGRAPH>At dinner, Charles tells her that he\u2019s purchased a horse of her very own. Little does he know what\u2019s really going on\u2026<PARAGRAPH>Emma escapes from dinner early and goes upstairs to think over her situation in privacy. She even thinks she looks different \u2013 and she feels as though her real life is finally starting.<PARAGRAPH>From the next day on, Emma and Rodolphe are committed to each other (at least, she\u2019s committed to him, and believes him when he says loves her).<PARAGRAPH>They do the stereotypical things people having affairs do \u2013 exchange notes, have secret rendezvous, etc.<PARAGRAPH>Emma is blissfully happy. She even runs out in the early morning (after Charles has left on an early call) and races over to La Huchette to see her lover.<PARAGRAPH>After this risky business goes on for a while, Rodolphe protests that she\u2019s getting too careless. Is he really concerned, or can it be that he\u2019s getting sick of her?
