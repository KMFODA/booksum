{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 15", "summary": "The opera is Donizetti\u2019s Lucia di Lammermoor, a tragedy in which an unfortunate heroine is driven mad because she\u2019s forced to marry the wrong man. Perhaps not the best choice for Emma\u2026<PARAGRAPH>Emma and Charles take a stroll before the opera, and when they finally settle down in their seats, Emma feels satisfied for the first time in a long while. Waiting for the show to start, she admires her fellow audience-members.<PARAGRAPH>The opera immediately transports Emma back to the romantic novels of Sir Walter Scott she enjoyed as a girl (the opera was based upon book called The Bride of Lammermoor by Scott). She feels the music reverberate in her soul \u2013 it sounds like the old Emma is back.<PARAGRAPH>The famous tenor recommended by Homais, Edgar Lagardy, makes a dramatic entrance onstage. Emma is struck by his appearance, and the whole audience falls for him.<PARAGRAPH>Emma sees her own story in the narrative that unfolds before her. She thinks that nobody has ever loved her the way that the hero and heroine love each other.<PARAGRAPH>Charles doesn\u2019t really get what\u2019s going on, and he keeps bugging Emma with questions. She\u2019s not amused.<PARAGRAPH>A wedding scene unfolds on stage, and Emma thinks of her own wedding \u2013 she wishes that she, like the opera\u2019s heroine, had resisted and not married Charles.<PARAGRAPH>As things get more and more dramatic onstage, they also get more and more dramatic in Emma\u2019s mind. She imagines what it would be like to be the lover of Lagardy, the tenor. She is swept up in the fantasy of running away with the singer across Europe when the curtain falls; it\u2019s intermission.<PARAGRAPH>Charles runs off clumsily to get Emma something to drink. On his way back, he manages to spill the drink on a very upset lady, but makes it back to Emma somehow.<PARAGRAPH>Charles has big news. While he was away, he saw someone we haven\u2019t encountered for a while: L\u00e9on Dupuis.<PARAGRAPH>Before Charles even finishes telling Emma about his encounter, L\u00e9on himself shows up in their box. He and Emma shake hands and start catching up; just then, Act III of the opera begins.<PARAGRAPH>Emma is no longer interested in the drama onstage, now that there\u2019s some drama sitting right next to her. All of her pre-Rodolphe feelings start to return.<PARAGRAPH>L\u00e9on obviously feels something, too \u2013 he suggests that they leave the theatre and go elsewhere to talk. Charles, who\u2019s actually kind of into the opera now, doesn\u2019t want to go, but Emma insists.<PARAGRAPH>At a caf\u00e9, they eat ice cream and make small talk. L\u00e9on attempts to show off by discussing music \u2013 he claims that Lagardy isn\u2019t all he\u2019s cracked up to be.<PARAGRAPH>Charles, who\u2019s still bummed about missing the end of the performance, suggests that perhaps Emma might like to stay in Rouen by herself for a couple of days and see the opera again. L\u00e9on, of course, encourages this.<PARAGRAPH>Emma demurely makes no promises \u2013 she smiles oddly, knowing that something\u2019s up with L\u00e9on. She and Charles will decide overnight what she should do.<PARAGRAPH>The old friends part ways, with the clerk promising to visit Yonville soon.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-2-chapter-15"}
