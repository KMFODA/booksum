{"name": "Part 3, Chapter 5", "summary": "Thursdays are Emma\u2019s Rouen days. She leaves on the Hirondelle at an ungodly hour of the morning, excited and anxious to see her lover.<PARAGRAPH>When she arrives, L\u00e9on comes to meet her. The two go to the same hotel room every week, and spend all day in bed, drinking champagne, eating, talking, and generally enjoying each other.<PARAGRAPH>L\u00e9on is enchanted both by Emma herself and by the idea that he has a real, live mistress.<PARAGRAPH>The end of their days together come fast, and each week they dramatically part. Before heading home in the Hirondelle, Emma gets her hair done in preparation for her return home.<PARAGRAPH>The stagecoach encounters a particularly unfortunate beggar on its trip \u2013 a blind man, whose horrifically infected eye-sockets are described in excruciating detail. Emma is afraid of him, though Hivert makes fun of the poor man.<PARAGRAPH>Charles is always waiting at home for Emma; she despairs on the inside upon arriving back in Yonville. She starts to care less about things at home, and never even yells at F\u00e9licit\u00e9 anymore.<PARAGRAPH>Justin still hangs around, attempting be useful, and cultivating his crush on Emma.<PARAGRAPH>The rest of the week passes in a haze of longing, until Emma and L\u00e9on are together again.<PARAGRAPH>In the safety of their hotel room, the lovers talk about their hopes, dreams, and fears; Emma admits to L\u00e9on that she has loved another man who left.<PARAGRAPH>Emma begins to think again about Paris, and wonders if they might be happier there.<PARAGRAPH>At home, Emma is extra careful to make Charles happy. Once, he almost finds something out \u2013 he ran into the woman that Emma supposedly takes piano lessons from, and she didn\u2019t know anything about Emma.<PARAGRAPH>Emma, afraid of being found out, makes up an excuse, then shows up later with a receipt for the lessons. From then on, it\u2019s just lies, lies, lies.<PARAGRAPH>Emma decides to take an extra hotel room in Rouen, just in case she encounters someone from the village in the city.<PARAGRAPH>One day, Monsieur Lheureux catches up to her, asking for all the money the Bovarys owe him.<PARAGRAPH>As always, he\u2019s thought of a temporary way out, through which he will certainly profit. He knows about a small piece of property Charles inherited, and encourages Emma to sell it. Since she has power of attorney, she has the right to do so. He\u2019s even lined up a buyer, a man called Langlois.<PARAGRAPH>The sale goes through quickly, and Lheureux assures Emma she did the right thing. She attempts to pay him back, but he instead gives her four more promissory notes.<PARAGRAPH>Oh no! Emma and Charles just keep sinking deeper and deeper into debt. This is getting scary. Despite the thousands of francs they owe the merchant, Emma orders a whole passel of new things. When presented with the bill, Charles ends up signing yet another sketchy promissory note.<PARAGRAPH>Charles\u2019s mom, who\u2019s visiting, bluntly states how foolish she finds this new round of purchases. She lets slip the fact that Charles has agreed to revoke the power of attorney he granted to Emma.<PARAGRAPH>Emma freaks out.<PARAGRAPH>For the first time, Charles rebels against his mother \u2013 at the worst possible time! She\u2019s the only one who demonstrates any common sense here, but Charles keeps defending Emma. His mother ends up leaving angrily.<PARAGRAPH>Charles, defeated by both the women in his life, has another power of attorney agreement drawn up to make Emma happy.<PARAGRAPH>Emma and L\u00e9on celebrate this renewal of her legal rights the next time they meet. Emma gets wilder and wilder \u2013 he doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with her, but he still finds her charming.<PARAGRAPH>One Thursday, Emma doesn\u2019t return to Yonville. Charles, a bit frantic, drives to Rouen himself in the dead of night to try and find her. He runs around the city looking for her everywhere.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, as he\u2019s about to go to the piano teacher\u2019s house, Emma herself comes out of nowhere, explaining that she was ill. Miraculously, Charles believes her.<PARAGRAPH>This incident actually gives Emma even more independence \u2013 she tells Charles that she can\u2019t feel free when he\u2019s always worrying about her. He gives her more space, which she promptly takes advantage of, heading into Rouen with the most ridiculous excuses every time she wants to see L\u00e9on.<PARAGRAPH>This recklessness starts to take its toll on L\u00e9on, however; his employers are unhappy with his constant absence. But he\u2019s easily led by his mistress, and he continues to escape work to meet her. He also does basically whatever she tells him to, from dressing all in black to attempting love poems in her honor (unfortunately, he can never come up with rhymes, and has to copy them).", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-3-chapter-5"}
