{"name": "Part 3, Chapter 6", "summary": "On his many trips back to Yonville, L\u00e9on often has dinner with Homais, and thus feels obliged to invite him to come visit in Rouen. One Thursday, Homais unexpectedly takes him up on the offer.<PARAGRAPH>Emma is shocked to see the pharmacist waiting for the Hirondelle \u2013 he\u2019s excited about his trip to the city, and tells her all about his plans to revisit the places of his youth. Emma is not pleased.<PARAGRAPH>Upon arrival in Rouen, Homais dashes off to find L\u00e9on, and drags him into a caf\u00e9. They proceed to linger there for hours as Homais reminisces about the good old days.<PARAGRAPH>In the meantime, Emma is getting impatient. She waits for L\u00e9on all afternoon in their hotel room.<PARAGRAPH>Back at the caf\u00e9, Homais starts teasing L\u00e9on about his mistress. Worried that the pharmacist knows something, L\u00e9on plays dumb \u2013 it turns out that Homais thinks that L\u00e9on is in love with F\u00e9licit\u00e9.<PARAGRAPH>This sets Homais off on a long diatribe about women. He goes on and on, as is his way, and L\u00e9on loses his patience. He rushes off, claiming to have an appointment.<PARAGRAPH>The pharmacist follows him all the way to the hotel. L\u00e9on rushes upstairs, and finds Emma distraught. He attempts to console her, but is called away again by Homais. He promises to return.<PARAGRAPH>L\u00e9on keeps trying to come up with new ways to get rid of the pharmacist. He says he has to work; Homais wants to come to the office. It\u2019s impossible to escape this man.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, L\u00e9on gives in to the pushy pharmacist, and they stop to visit a friend of Homais\u2019s. However, in the end, L\u00e9on manages to escape and run to the hotel \u2013 but Emma is gone.<PARAGRAPH>Emma decides first that she hates L\u00e9on, then that she\u2019s being too harsh on him. The pair reconciles, but things are different.<PARAGRAPH>In the following days, Emma and L\u00e9on\u2019s relationship sours. She still attempts to throw herself at him, hoping to find happiness again, but it\u2019s no use.<PARAGRAPH>L\u00e9on starts to wonder if Emma\u2019s going a little mad. She makes him nervous now, and he also starts to resent her domination. However, unfortunately for L\u00e9on, he still melts into a little puddle of love every time he sees her.<PARAGRAPH>Emma actually is getting more than a little obsessive \u2013 she wants to know what L\u00e9on is doing all the time, and even thinks of having him followed.<PARAGRAPH>Nothing makes her happy anymore and, once again, she looks back on her life and wonders where it all went wrong. Sound familiar? It should \u2013 this has all happened before. Life seems hopeless once again.<PARAGRAPH>One day, the financial situation gets even worse \u2013 it turns out that Lheureux has turned Emma\u2019s debt over to one of his associates, one Monsieur Vin\u00e7art. Emma sends the messenger away, claiming that she\u2019ll pay up later. Unfortunately, the next day an official protest of non-payment shows up. Yikes.<PARAGRAPH>Emma runs to complain to Lheureux. He plays dumb, then attempts to shift the blame over to the mysterious Monsieur Vin\u00e7art. Emma leaves, somewhat pacified, and even accepts some fabric from the merchant (which, of course, she\u2019ll have to pay for later).<PARAGRAPH>Emma steps it up a notch, and figures out ways to get some money. The money from both Emma\u2019s and Charles\u2019s families has run out, so she starts billing patients behind Charles\u2019s back.<PARAGRAPH>She manages to limp along in this fashion for a while, paying off her debt in small portions, then signing more of those awful promissory notes. Clearly, Emma doesn\u2019t really get what\u2019s going on \u2013 when she tries to figure it out, she gets confused and gives up, which is so not the right thing to do.<PARAGRAPH>The house falls into disrepair; Emma snaps whenever anyone asks her about it.<PARAGRAPH>Poor Charles is still madly in love with Emma, and can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s going on with her. They don\u2019t even sleep in the same bed anymore \u2013 Emma stays in the bedroom, reading horror novels all night, while Charles is exiled to the attic.<PARAGRAPH>Emma\u2019s only happiness comes from her weekly escapes to Rouen. She still enjoys the luxury of the hotel room, and helps L\u00e9on pay for the room, despite her debts.<PARAGRAPH>He suggests that they might try a cheaper place, but Emma isn\u2019t down with that. They stick with the expensive hotel.<PARAGRAPH>To pay for this, Emma sells some of her things \u2013 she even asks L\u00e9on to pawn the fancy spoons her father gave her for her wedding. He\u2019s uncomfortable with this, and begins to wonder if his friends and family are right in telling him to ditch the mistress.<PARAGRAPH>L\u00e9on vows never to see Emma again, and this resolve diminishes her power over him. Now he\u2019s bored by her melodramatic outbursts.<PARAGRAPH>Just as in her affair with Rodolphe, Emma also feels the excitement go out of the relationship. She blames L\u00e9on, and wishes something terrible might happen so she can have an excuse to get out of their entanglement, but she\u2019s too cowardly to actually say anything to him.<PARAGRAPH>All the while, Emma imagines another ideal man, one made up of her assorted memories and desires, who can carry her away from her dull, humdrum life. Again, her fantasy world begins to consume reality.<PARAGRAPH>One Thursday, Emma stays the night in Rouen, partying it up with L\u00e9on and his friends at a masked ball. She is horrified by the company she finds herself in \u2013 the other women present are prostitutes. She faints, revives, then flees the party, disgusted with herself.<PARAGRAPH>Back in Yonville the next afternoon, Emma arrives home to a dreadful surprise: her house is being seized by governmental order! An official document had been sent the day before, demanding that she pay the whopping sum of eight thousand francs within twenty four hours.<PARAGRAPH>She doesn\u2019t believe it can possibly be true \u2013 the ridiculous enormity of the sum makes her think that it\u2019s just Lheureux trying to scare her.<PARAGRAPH>She goes to visit the merchant, confident that they can work something out.<PARAGRAPH>But Lheureux is not in a forgiving mood. It\u2019s payback time \u2013 literally. Emma realizes that this is serious business. She even tries to use her feminine wiles on Lheureux, but it\u2019s no use; he only wants his money.<PARAGRAPH>Lheureux heartlessly kicks Emma out of the office, desperate and helpless.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-3-chapter-6"}
