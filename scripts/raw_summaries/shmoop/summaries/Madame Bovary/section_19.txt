{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 11", "summary": "It turns out that Homais is all excited about some article on curing clubfeet. He\u2019s convinced that Charles should attempt to fix the clubfoot of Hippolyte, a servant at Madame Lefran\u00e7ois\u2019s inn.<PARAGRAPH>Emma is easily convinced. She hopes that the operation will earn Charles some respect and extra cash. This helps a lot with her resolution to stay with him.<PARAGRAPH>Charles, despite his profound lack of medical talent, agrees to do it. He prepares for the operation by reading and attempting to understand it, while Homais works on getting Hippolyte himself to agree.<PARAGRAPH>Hippolyte gives in to the pharmacist\u2019s goading (and that of the rest of the town, who all feel involved in this process), and accepts the operation.<PARAGRAPH>Charles, in the meanwhile, is having a heck of a time figuring out how to fix Hippolyte\u2019s disfigured leg. He\u2019s clearly confused and concerned, but goes ahead gamely anyway. He ends up cutting poor Hippolyte\u2019s Achilles tendon, thinking that it\u2019s the right thing to do. Ugh, just thinking of it gives us the chills.<PARAGRAPH>After the operation, which appears at first to be a success, Emma actually voluntarily embraces Charles. The two of them are happier together than we\u2019ve ever seen them. She is finally able to muster up a little bit of affection for poor Charles, who she now views as an up-and-coming surgeon in the making.<PARAGRAPH>Homais busily writes up the operation for the Rouen paper, claiming that it\u2019s a complete success.<PARAGRAPH>However, this honeymoon period doesn\u2019t last. Five days after the operation, Madame Lefran\u00e7ois bursts in, claiming that Hippolyte is dying. Charles and Homais rush off to see what\u2019s wrong.<PARAGRAPH>Gaah! What isn\u2019t wrong would be a better question. Hippolyte\u2019s foot is a disgusting mass of infection, trapped within the bizarre torture device Charles strapped it into. Ignoring Hippolyte's claims of incredible pain, they put him back in the apparatus.<PARAGRAPH>Three days later, though, the infection is way, way worse \u2013 it\u2019s so disgusting we don\u2019t even want to tell you about it here. Seriously. GROSS.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone tries to make Hippolyte feel better, except for the peasants who come to the inn to play billiards. They just make him feel worse, and tell him that he smells bad.<PARAGRAPH>Actually, that\u2019s not just a taunt \u2013 it\u2019s true. The gangrenous leg reeks up a storm. Hippolyte is in total despair, but Charles, who has no clue how to fix it, just tells him to eat more lightly (what?).<PARAGRAPH>To make matters even worse, Father Bournisien comes over to harass the crippled man about his lack of religion. We\u2019re sure it didn\u2019t exactly make Hippolyte feel any better.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Madame Lefran\u00e7ois, worried about the lack of improvement, send for Monsieur Canivet, a real M.D. from Neufch\u00e2tel.<PARAGRAPH>Canivet, who is, unlike Charles, an actual doctor, laughs contemptuously when he sees Hippolyte\u2019s condition, and says what everyone should have known by now \u2013 the leg must be amputated. He complains to Homais about practitioners (like Charles) who make use of ridiculous procedures without a thought about the patients\u2026or victims, rather.<PARAGRAPH>Homais feels bad, but chooses not to defend Charles \u2013 after all, Monsieur Canivet is an important man.<PARAGRAPH>The amputation is a big event for the village. Everyone is quite excited, except, presumably, for Hippolyte. Poor guy.<PARAGRAPH>Canivet struts into the town, confident in his own abilities. He derides officiers de sant\u00e9 like Charles, claiming that they ruin the reputation of doctors everywhere.<PARAGRAPH>Speaking of our old friend, Charles stays at home, miserable, embarrassed, and guilty for the part he\u2019s played in Hippolyte\u2019s disaster.<PARAGRAPH>Emma sits by him, humiliated and angry. She\u2019s mad at herself for even hoping that Charles could be anything but mediocre.<PARAGRAPH>This is the last straw for Emma. She can\u2019t believe she ever felt bad for cheating on Charles.<PARAGRAPH>The angry tension of the Bovary household is broken by a horrifying shriek that echoes through the village. The amputation is underway.<PARAGRAPH>Charles and Emma stare at each other through the sounds of Hippolyte\u2019s screams \u2013 and to Emma, everything about her husband disgusts her. Her feelings for Rodolphe come rushing back, and it\u2019s as though Charles is permanently alienated from her life from this point on.<PARAGRAPH>The operation is apparently over \u2013 they see Canivet and Homais leave the inn and return to the pharmacy.<PARAGRAPH>Despairing, Charles asks Emma to kiss him. She refuses him violently, and flees the room.<PARAGRAPH>Charles has no clue what\u2019s going on.<PARAGRAPH>That night, Emma and Rodolphe are reunited in the garden \u2013 they kiss passionately, their affair back in full bloom.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-2-chapter-11"}
