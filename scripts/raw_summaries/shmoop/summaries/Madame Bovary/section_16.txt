{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 8", "summary": "It\u2019s a big day for little Yonville \u2013 the town fair. Everyone in the town is up early to set up for it. Binet, who doubles as the captain of the fire brigade, is all gussied up. The whole town is looking its best.<PARAGRAPH>The only person who\u2019s not too thrilled about all of this is Madame Lefran\u00e7ois. Homais stops to chat with her, and she cheers up a little when she finds out that he\u2019s on the fair advisory committee (he got there through a dubious claim that his knowledge of chemistry gives him advanced knowledge of farming).<PARAGRAPH>Homais keeps talking, but his audience is not listening. We follow Madame Lefran\u00e7ois\u2019 gaze and see what has put her in such a foul mood \u2013 the town\u2019s other tavern, her rival, is full of singing people. These good days won\u2019t last too long, though; she tells Homais that she heard that Tellier, the barkeep, was in such great debt to Monsieur Lheureux that the tavern was going to be shut down the following week.<PARAGRAPH>From the perspective of these gossiping neighbors, we see Emma and Rodolphe a little ways off, talking to Monsieur Lheureux. Rodolphe is obviously planning on making his move already \u2013 unlike L\u00e9on, he\u2019s a pretty smooth operator.<PARAGRAPH>Homais goes over to say hello, but Rodolphe manages to avoid him. He regards Emma as they walk along \u2013 he\u2019s pleased with what he sees.<PARAGRAPH>Monsieur Lheureux attempts to follow them and maintain their conversation, but they get rid of him quickly. Rodolphe immediately launches his attack and starts flirting openly with Emma once they\u2019re alone.<PARAGRAPH>The townspeople are assembled for various agricultural competitions. Rodolphe is supposed to participate in the judging, but he has other things on his mind. He turns all his attention to Emma, who responds eagerly to him.<PARAGRAPH>He knows exactly what buttons to push \u2013 they talk about the frustrations of provincial life, the loneliness of existence\u2026basically, all of Emma\u2019s favorite subjects.<PARAGRAPH>Their conversation is interrupted by the entrance of the fire brigade and the start of the awards ceremony. A government official, Monsieur Lieuvain, arrives to dole out the prizes; he gives a long, long, loooong speech about the government, the country.<PARAGRAPH>While this is going on, Emma and Rodolphe continue their intimate conversation. Rodolphe claims that the only true duty is to enjoy what\u2019s beautiful about life, and reject the conventions of society.<PARAGRAPH>Emma feebly tries to argue that society\u2019s moral standards are important, but Rodolphe shoots her down promptly. He\u2019s the clear winner here; Emma is toast.<PARAGRAPH>Monsieur Lieuvain, in the meanwhile, just keeps talking and talking. He\u2019s full of governmental rhetoric, but he\u2019s basically not talking about anything. Despite this fact, the whole town (except for Emma and Rodolphe) is enraptured by him.<PARAGRAPH>Rodolphe quickly wins Emma over. All of her feelings about L\u00e9on, the Viscount at the ball, and her loneliness come rushing back, and re-focus on Rodolphe. She\u2019s smitten.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Monsieur Lieuvain wraps up his speech. Another speech begins, and Rodolphe continues to woo Emma all the while.<PARAGRAPH>Agricultural prizes are given for things as diverse as pigs, liquid manure (gross), and drainage. Simultaneously (in an inspired moment of truly ridiculous juxtaposition), Rodolphe declares his love for Emma.<PARAGRAPH>The prizes, and the wooing, conclude with the awarding of a prize for long service, which is awarded to a confused little old woman. Flaubert describes this woman, Catherine Leroux, with rather excruciating detail; she\u2019s obviously been broken down by years of hard work. She says that she will give her prize money to the priest, which offends Homais.<PARAGRAPH>Following this ludicrous ceremony, a big feast begins. The townspeople, in a frenzy of communal gluttony, all stuff themselves.<PARAGRAPH>Rodolphe isn\u2019t interested in the food \u2013 he\u2019s thinking of Emma and of the pleasure he\u2019ll get from her in the future. Emma is off with Charles and the Homais family.<PARAGRAPH>The grand finale of the festival is a display of fireworks \u2013 unfortunately, they\u2019re too damp, and they barely go off. The evening ends rather anti-climactically, and everyone drifts back home.<PARAGRAPH>Homais proceeds to write an enthusiastic, over-the-top article about the fiesta, and publish it in a Rouen paper.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-2-chapter-8"}
