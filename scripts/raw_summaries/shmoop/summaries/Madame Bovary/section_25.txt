{"name": "Part 3, Chapter 2", "summary": "Emma returns to the inn, and finds that she\u2019s missed the Hirondelle, which was there to pick her up earlier. She hires a cab and catches up to the stagecoach. She returns home.<PARAGRAPH>Once there, F\u00e9licit\u00e9 sends her next door to the Homais house, saying that it\u2019s urgent.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s jam making day in Yonville, a particularly hectic time.<PARAGRAPH>At chez Homais, Emma discovers the pharmacist\u2019s family in an uproar. It turns out that Justin almost made a fatal mistake \u2013 he almost used a pan for jam that was dangerously close to the jar of arsenic.<PARAGRAPH>Homais is unbelievably angry; his wife and the children freak out, as though they\u2019d already been poisoned. Emma observes all this, as Homais goes through the whole chain of events again.<PARAGRAPH>Poor Justin. Things just go from bad to worse for him. As Homais shakes him back and forth angrily, a book falls out of his pocket. Not just any book\u2026a book called Conjugal Love. With pictures. The children are struck dumb, and Homais snatches it away furiously.<PARAGRAPH>At this point, Emma successfully breaks into the conversation. She asks what\u2019s wrong.<PARAGRAPH>Homais bluntly tells her that her father-in-law, the elder Monsieur Bovary, is dead.<PARAGRAPH>Emma goes to find Charles as Homais cools down a bit, still grumbling.<PARAGRAPH>Charles has been waiting for his wife, and tearfully greets her with a hug and kiss. Emma, remembering L\u00e9on, is grossed out by her husband. She responds with an extraordinary lack of sympathy.<PARAGRAPH>Charles, poor man, just thinks that Emma is struck by grief, when in reality, she just doesn\u2019t know what to say, and doesn\u2019t feel anything.<PARAGRAPH>Hippolyte limps in, bringing Emma\u2019s bags. Emma is embarrassed as ever by his presence, a symbol of Charles\u2019s failures.<PARAGRAPH>The next day, Charles\u2019s mother arrives. Mother and son are debilitated by grief; Emma is unmoved. Instead, she\u2019s daydreaming about L\u00e9on.<PARAGRAPH>Monsieur Lheureux, who seems to have an incredible radar system for knowing the absolute worst time for stopping by, stops by.<PARAGRAPH>The merchant and Emma step aside to discuss business. Lheureux slyly proposes another lending arrangement \u2013 knowing that Emma is a fool with money, he wants Charles to give her power of attorney (basically control over their financial situation), so he can deal with her.<PARAGRAPH>Soon enough, he returns with yards of black fabric for a mourning dress.<PARAGRAPH>Lheureux keeps pushing Emma about the whole power of attorney business, which she doesn\u2019t really understand. However, she figures things out soon enough.<PARAGRAPH>As soon as Charles\u2019s mother leaves, Emma goes into financier mode. She has a document drawn up by the notary, which gives her control over the family\u2019s money and loans.<PARAGRAPH>Charles is amazed by what seems like Emma\u2019s common sense. She slyly suggests that they should have someone else look over the notarized document before they sign it \u2013 and Charles himself sends her to Rouen to meet with L\u00e9on. She\u2019s gone for three days.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-3-chapter-2"}
