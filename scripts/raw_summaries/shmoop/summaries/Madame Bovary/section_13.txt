{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 5", "summary": "The usual quartet is out on an odd and incredibly boring field trip. They\u2019re visiting a new spinning mill just outside town, along with two of Homais\u2019 unfortunately named children, Athalie and Napol\u00e9on.<PARAGRAPH>The main attraction is generally unattractive.<PARAGRAPH>Homais, as usual, chats up a storm. Everyone else is somewhat pensive. Emma reflects suddenly upon how irritating Charles is, even when he\u2019s doing nothing.<PARAGRAPH>L\u00e9on, on the other hand, looks particularly lovely to her. She begins to realize that something is happening between them.<PARAGRAPH>Napol\u00e9on ruins the moment by generally being bratty. He\u2019s painted his shoes white with a pile of lime that\u2019s lying around the mill. Charles and Justin attempt to get rid of it.<PARAGRAPH>That evening, Emma thinks about the day \u2013 and about L\u00e9on. She can\u2019t stop envisioning his face, his mannerisms, the sound of his voice. Finally, an epiphany: L\u00e9on loves her!<PARAGRAPH>Once she admits this to herself, Emma goes into full-out dramatic Love Overdrive. She laments fate, lolls around the house swooning left and right, and drifts about in a blissful haze. Generally, she does everything she\u2019s read about in books.<PARAGRAPH>The next day, Monsieur Lheureux, the dry-goods merchant (he sells things like fabric and pretty much any household item) stops by for a visit. He is quite clever and sounds, from Flaubert\u2019s description, like a pretty shady character. Nobody knows what he was up to before he came to Yonville.<PARAGRAPH>The merchant knows exactly what buttons to press with Emma. He talks up her elegance and refinement, then offers her a selection of dainty items to choose from. She sticks by her guns and says she doesn\u2019t need anything, but the seed has been planted \u2013 Emma, naturally, wants pretty things.<PARAGRAPH>Lheureux also slyly tells Emma that if she needs money, she can always borrow it from him\u2026which doesn\u2019t sound like such a great idea, if you ask us.<PARAGRAPH>Emma congratulates herself on being so frugal, but she still can\u2019t stop thinking of Monsieur Lheureux\u2019s pretty wares.<PARAGRAPH>L\u00e9on shows up, nervous and on edge. He wants to say something to her about his feelings, but chickens out yet again. Awkwardness ensues.<PARAGRAPH>In the wake of the realization that she and L\u00e9on are in love, Emma attempts briefly to reform herself \u2013 she goes all serious and tries to clean up her act.<PARAGRAPH>Emma\u2019s good girl fa\u00e7ade fools everyone, even L\u00e9on. He begins to wonder how he\u2019d even hoped to get close to her. In his mind, she becomes even more spectacular and flawless.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone admires Emma for her elegance and character. Now that she\u2019s playing the good housewife, she floats along easily in Yonville society. However, on the inside, she conceals passionate feelings. We\u2019re talking serious angst, here. When she\u2019s alone, she can only think of L\u00e9on \u2013 actually, these fantasies are more enjoyable than his presence, which leaves her unsatisfied.<PARAGRAPH>Emma wishes L\u00e9on would notice that she\u2019s in love with him, but she\u2019s either too lazy or too scared to make anything happen herself. She consoles herself by striking dramatic poses in the mirror and prides herself on her \"virtue.\"<PARAGRAPH>All of Emma\u2019s secret troubles build up to the boiling point, and she strikes out, complaining about the littlest things, like a door left open or a dish she doesn\u2019t enjoy.<PARAGRAPH>She is also incredibly irritated by Charles\u2019s dopey lack of awareness; he\u2019s still sure that he\u2019s making her perfectly happy. She feels underappreciated, and makes Charles the focus of all her aggression.<PARAGRAPH>Emma\u2019s depression returns from time to time. F\u00e9licit\u00e9 tries to comfort her, telling her that she once knew another girl who suffered from a similar problem \u2013 it was cured by marriage. Unfortunately for Emma, her sadness was brought on by her marriage to Charles.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-2-chapter-5"}
