{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 4", "summary": "Once the winter arrives, Emma moves into the parlor from her room. She sits and people-watches all day.<PARAGRAPH>Twice a day, she sees L\u00e9on go back and forth to and from his office.<PARAGRAPH>Monsieur Homais continues to be an attentive neighbor; he stops by every day around dinner time to discuss the daily news with Charles and to give Emma household tips.<PARAGRAPH>After this evening chat, Justin (Homais\u2019 cousin/apprentice/servant boy) comes in to fetch his master. Homais pokes fun at the boy for having a crush on F\u00e9licit\u00e9.<PARAGRAPH>The pharmacist also scolds Justin for eavesdropping all the time.<PARAGRAPH>On Sundays, the Homais household entertains the few townspeople Monsieur Homais hasn\u2019t alienated. L\u00e9on and the Bovarys always come.<PARAGRAPH>On these occasions, L\u00e9on is always by Emma\u2019s side, talking to her, coaching her at card games, and looking at magazines with her.<PARAGRAPH>Something is obviously going on between Emma and L\u00e9on. Charles, unsuspecting as ever, has no idea. At this point, Emma herself doesn\u2019t fully realize it.<PARAGRAPH>L\u00e9on is careful to include Charles in his thoughts, as to avoid suspicions. He gives the officier de sant\u00e9 a splendid phrenological head model for his birthday (a kind of bizarro medical fad of the nineteenth century \u2013 supposedly different head shapes have different meanings).<PARAGRAPH>L\u00e9on is always willing to get things for Emma, from the latest books to a bushel of cacti.<PARAGRAPH>Emma and L\u00e9on each have little gardens outside their windows, from which they look at each other while tending the plants.<PARAGRAPH>To show her gratitude, Emma has a gorgeous velvet bedspread sent over to L\u00e9on\u2026it seems like something of an extravagant present. Everyone else is sure that the pair are lovers.<PARAGRAPH>L\u00e9on idiotically reinforces this idea by talking about Emma 24/7. Even poor Binet gets so sick of him that he snaps at the boy one day.<PARAGRAPH>Ah, l\u2019amour! L\u00e9on is tortured by his love for Emma, and tries to figure out how to possibly tell her. He can\u2019t bring himself to do it.<PARAGRAPH>Emma, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t get all worked up; she doesn\u2019t even try and see if she is or isn\u2019t in love with him. Flaubert ominously ends the chapter, though, with the suggestion that one day she\u2019ll crack and her love will be out of control.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-2-chapter-4"}
