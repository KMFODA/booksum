{"name": "Part 3, Chapter 1", "summary": "A lot of things happened to L\u00e9on in Paris. First of all, he studied law. Secondly, he studied women. He\u2019s no longer the same shy boy he was before. All along, he held on to a vague hope that someday he and Emma might actually get together, even while he had new experiences with other women.<PARAGRAPH>This new L\u00e9on is resolved to \"possess\" Emma. He\u2019s determined and much craftier than he used to be. He follows Emma and Charles to their inn, then returns the next morning to scout out the situation. He discovers Emma in the hotel room\u2026alone.<PARAGRAPH>L\u00e9on has become something of a sweet-talker over the past few years. Perhaps he\u2019s not at the same level as Rodolphe, but he\u2019s getting up there. He and Emma talk and talk about the various sorrows of their lives. Sigh. Same old, same old.<PARAGRAPH>Noticeably, Emma doesn\u2019t say anything about loving another man, and L\u00e9on doesn\u2019t say anything about kind of forgetting Emma.<PARAGRAPH>Both of them make dramatic claims, each saying that life is miserable without the other.<PARAGRAPH>Basically, this love scene is just one big string of complaints \u2013 there\u2019s nothing romantic about that. Finally, L\u00e9on gives in and says out loud that he was in love with her.<PARAGRAPH>All of a sudden the tension is broken, and old feelings come rushing out, created anew by their current proximity. Emma is startled by how much she remembers \u2013 she feels old and experienced.<PARAGRAPH>They talk until night falls.<PARAGRAPH>L\u00e9on suggests that they could start over again, but Emma, attempting to be noble, says that she\u2019s too old and he\u2019s too young (they actually aren\u2019t that different in age, if at all).<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s late \u2013 they\u2019ve even missed the opera. L\u00e9on gets up to leave, but convinces Emma to meet him one more time. She makes their meeting point the famous Rouen cathedral.<PARAGRAPH>That night, Emma writes a farewell letter of her own, explaining to L\u00e9on why they can\u2019t be together. However, she can\u2019t send it, since she doesn\u2019t have his address. She decides to give it to him in person.<PARAGRAPH>Before the rendezvous, L\u00e9on primps nervously. He even buys Emma flowers, and goes to meet her at the cathedral.<PARAGRAPH>There, he\u2019s met not by Emma, but by a cathedral guide, who attempts to give L\u00e9on a tour.<PARAGRAPH>Emma\u2019s late, and L\u00e9on grows more anxious. Finally, she arrives. She starts to give him the letter, but is seized by the desire to pray. L\u00e9on is both charmed and irritated.<PARAGRAPH>As they\u2019re about to leave, the guide comes up and offers to give them a tour again. Emma, concerned for her virtue, desperately says yes.<PARAGRAPH>They follow the guide, not listening, through the cathedral and back to where they started. Before they get to the tower, L\u00e9on basically hurls a coin at the poor guide and pulls Emma away with him. The guide doesn\u2019t get the picture \u2013 he just keeps coming back. The couple flees the cathedral rather comically.<PARAGRAPH>Outside, L\u00e9on sends a little street kid to find a cab for them. Awkwardly, they wait alone \u2013 there\u2019s a kind of aggressive tension between them.<PARAGRAPH>The cab arrives. They get in as the cathedral guy yells at them from the church door, and L\u00e9on tells the driver to go wherever he wants.<PARAGRAPH>The following is one of the most famous scenes of the novel. We see the cab rushing through Rouen aimlessly; we can\u2019t see inside it, but we can, however, guess what\u2019s going on\u2026L\u00e9on keeps yelling up to the driver to keep going; he and Emma stay concealed in the cab.<PARAGRAPH>The poor cab driver is tired and certainly weirded out. His horses are exhausted, and everyone\u2019s demoralized. The passengers, however, give no sign.<PARAGRAPH>Around mid-afternoon, a hand is seen throwing scraps of paper out the window; we assume it\u2019s Emma bidding farewell to the well-intentioned farewell letter.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, in the early evening, the cab stops. Emma calmly steps out of it and walks away.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-3-chapter-1"}
