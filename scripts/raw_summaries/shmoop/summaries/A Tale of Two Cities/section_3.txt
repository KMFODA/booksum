{"name": "Volume I, Chapter Four \u2013 The Preparation", "summary": "Mr. Lorry finally arrives in Dover.<PARAGRAPH>He makes sure that there\u2019s a boat that's bound for Calais and leaving the next morning, and then he heads to the inn.<PARAGRAPH>As he comes down from his room for dinner, the landlady and the surrounding guests observe him: Mr. Lorry is a nice, neatly-dressed little man of around sixty years.<PARAGRAPH>He seems to be completely  prim and proper, except for his eyes: they appear to be full of compassion and emotion.<PARAGRAPH>As our narrator points out, compassion and emotion aren\u2019t exactly valuable characteristics for a banker to possess.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s probably safe to assume that Mr. Lorry\u2019s worked hard to hide them well from his colleagues.<PARAGRAPH>When Mr. Lorry\u2019s breakfast arrives, he informs the landlady that a young woman will soon be arriving. He thinks that she\u2019ll ask for someone from Tellson\u2019s bank, but she won\u2019t know Mr. Lorry by name.<PARAGRAPH>Sure enough, the landlady has heard of Tellson\u2019s. She and Mr. Lorry have a friendly chat about the wonders of that reputable bank.<PARAGRAPH>Here\u2019s the synopsis: Tellson\u2019s is very, very reputable. It\u2019s been in London for 150 years.<PARAGRAPH>It also has a branch in Paris that\u2019s been around for nearly as long as the one in London.<PARAGRAPH>The landlady is suitably impressed.<PARAGRAPH>Wandering around the city of Dover, Mr. Lorry spends his day hashing and re-hashing the imaginary conversation he had with the dead man while he traveled.<PARAGRAPH>Around supper time, however, he returns to the inn.<PARAGRAPH>A young girl arrives just as he does; she\u2019s upstairs when he returns.<PARAGRAPH>A bit uneasy, Mr. Lorry pulls at his wig.<PARAGRAPH>That doesn\u2019t seem to do much good at all, but  apparently it makes him feel better.<PARAGRAPH>He goes up to the young girl\u2019s room.<PARAGRAPH>By the fire, he sees a slender, young, pretty girl whose eyes are incredibly expressive\u2014and incredibly familiar.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, they look just like the eyes of a young child whom he once carried from Calais to Dover eighteen years earlier.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Manette (that\u2019s the young girl\u2019s name, by the way) asks Mr. Lorry to be seated.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s been told that Mr. Lorry has information regarding her late father\u2019s property.<PARAGRAPH>He sits and explains that he\u2019s been sent to explain\u2026something.<PARAGRAPH>After awkwardly attempting to explain that something for a good while, he finally puts forth a \"hypothetical\" story.<PARAGRAPH>Before he begins, however, he makes it absolutely clear that he is a \"man of business.\" As such, he asks for Miss Manette to listen to a small business matter.<PARAGRAPH>Long ago, a \"man of business\" was the trustee of a French doctor. This doctor had a small child.<PARAGRAPH>Ring any bells? It sure does for Miss Manette. She\u2019s turned pale and is listening excitedly.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry hastens to assure her that he feels nothing. He\u2019s a mere machine of the bank.<PARAGRAPH>Funny, the longer he talks, the harder it is for us to believe that.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Manette recognizes the story as being very, very much like that of her father\u2019s.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry agrees. There\u2019s one difference, however: this doctor is still alive.<PARAGRAPH>He urges Miss Manette to think of his story as a mere matter of business, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be working very well.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, he tells her that the mother of the young girl died when the child was two, after searching for her father for two years.<PARAGRAPH>Her father\u2026well, her father has been found.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s alive. He may not be much more than alive, but at least they\u2019ve finally found him.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry proposes that he and Miss Manette go together to Paris to find her father.<PARAGRAPH>Turning completely ashen, Miss Manette murmurs that she\u2019s going to see a ghost.<PARAGRAPH>She seems to have fainted completely away. Mr. Lorry has no idea what to do.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, a wild-looking red-haired woman rushes into the room.<PARAGRAPH>She flies into a fury at Mr. Lorry. How dare he upset her darling in this way?<PARAGRAPH>Ordering Mr. Lorry to fetch some smelling salts, she quickly brings Lucie back to consciousness.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry humbly asks if the woman will accompany Lucie to France.<PARAGRAPH>She offers a brusque reply: she\u2019s never seen any need to cross the water. For her mistress, however, she\u2019ll do anything.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-1-chapter-4"}
