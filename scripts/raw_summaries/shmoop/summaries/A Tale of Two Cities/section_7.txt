{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Two \u2013 A Sight", "summary": "Jerry Cruncher heads into the bank to figure out what his assignment for the day will be.<PARAGRAPH>An old bank clerk sends him to the courts with a note for Mr. Lorry.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Mr. Lorry just wants Jerry to hang around as a messenger for him at the court.<PARAGRAPH>Interested in the prospect of some excitement at the court, Jerry asks the clerk what sort of trial will be held today.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s a trial for treason.<PARAGRAPH>That means that the accused will be drawn and quartered. Jerry\u2019s pretty excited.<PARAGRAPH>We interrupt this summary for a quick history announcement:<PARAGRAPH>Drawing and quartering is the traditional punishment for high treason in the U.K.  Remember the ending of Braveheart? That\u2019s drawing and quartering.<PARAGRAPH>For those of you who aren\u2019t Mel Gibson fans, however, we\u2019ll explain a bit.<PARAGRAPH>First, convicted traitors were hanged until they were almost dead.<PARAGRAPH>Then they were disemboweled.<PARAGRAPH>Then they were beheaded. And their bodies were cut into four parts.<PARAGRAPH>In other words, it wasn\u2019t all that pleasant.<PARAGRAPH>It wasn\u2019t all that much better for women at the time, either. They weren\u2019t beheaded: they were burned at the stake.<PARAGRAPH>Back to our story...<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Jerry Cruncher is actually pretty excited about the prospect of a high treason case. Chances are that the guy will be hanged\u2014whether or not he\u2019s guilty.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry heads to the court. Mr. Lorry\u2019s already there.<PARAGRAPH>The court itself is  packed to the gills. Apparently everyone loves a treason case as much as Jerry does.<PARAGRAPH>Also, everyone loves a good drink. The place reeks of alcohol.<PARAGRAPH>Hmm\u2026sounds more like Judge Judy than Law and Order. We\u2019re not really sure if this is supposed to be a court or a circus.<PARAGRAPH>In the center of all the hubbub is the prisoner.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s going to be central to the story, so we\u2019ll spend some time introducing him.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s about twenty-five. He appears to be a gentleman. Oh, and did we mention that he\u2019s really good-looking? Well, he is.<PARAGRAPH>Although he appears to be a little bit shaken to be in the middle of a three-ring circus, Charles Darnay is, in all other respects, a fine, fine man.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, that doesn\u2019t stop the rest of the spectators in the court from mentally hanging, drawing, and quartering the guy before he\u2019s even been tried.<PARAGRAPH>\u2026everyone, that is, except for a young woman and a distinguished-looking older man.<PARAGRAPH>They\u2019re Lucie and her father, in case you were wondering.<PARAGRAPH>As it turns out, they happen to be the key witnesses in the case against Darnay.<PARAGRAPH>What? Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll explain. It just might take us a chapter or two.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-2"}
