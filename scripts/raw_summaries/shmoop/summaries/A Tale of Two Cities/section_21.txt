{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Sixteen \u2013 Still Knitting", "summary": "Madame Defarge and her husband return to their shop after the procession.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, the mender of roads makes his way back into the country.<PARAGRAPH>The country folk seem to have changed as a result of the hanging in the village. Their faces are harder; their eyes have become full of vengeance.<PARAGRAPH>Sounds to us like  a storm's a-brewin'.<PARAGRAPH>Okay, but let\u2019s head back to Paris for now, shall we?<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge is quizzing her husband about the news that he\u2019s just heard from a Jacques who\u2019s on the police force.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, the police have hired a new spy to ferret out revolutionaries (or Jacqueses, as we like to call them).<PARAGRAPH>This new spy is English. His name is Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge says that he\u2019ll need to be registered in her knitting.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge describes the guy\u2019s physical appearance.<PARAGRAPH>Nodding, Madame Defarge takes it all down. She\u2019s pretty pleased at her husband\u2019s ability to get such good information.<PARAGRAPH>As the two enter the empty wine-shop, Madame Defarge asks her husband why he seems so down and out.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge sighs, then says that change seems to take such a long time. Too long, perhaps.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge stares at him sternly. Then she begins to lecture him.<PARAGRAPH>In case we haven\u2019t mentioned it, she\u2019s something of  a force of nature.<PARAGRAPH>She manages to slap him back into shape pretty quickly.<PARAGRAPH>Okay, she doesn\u2019t actually slap him. But she does point out that he\u2019s being feeble and just a bit cowardly.<PARAGRAPH>Sure, revolution takes a long time to prepare. But they\u2019ll have helped bring it about\u2014even if they\u2019re not alive to see its effects.<PARAGRAPH>The next morning, Madame Defarge sits at her seat.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s knitting. Of course. Beside her knitting lies a rose.<PARAGRAPH>A man walks into the shop.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge picks up the rose and slides it into her cap.<PARAGRAPH>As if someone\u2019s issued a secret sign, the shop falls silent.<PARAGRAPH>People slink out the back exits as the new customer comes up to the counter.<PARAGRAPH>A secret sign? Really? Wonder what it could be\u2026.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge makes polite conversation with the newcomer.<PARAGRAPH>The guy\u2019s eyes dart everywhere, but he can\u2019t seem to come up with anything out of the ordinary.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge thinks to herself that the man should stay around another minute longer.<PARAGRAPH>That way, she\u2019ll be able to knit his entire name, John Barsad, into her register.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge walks in. He glances at his wife, then greets the new customer.<PARAGRAPH>The new man hails him cheerfully as \"Jacques.\"<PARAGRAPH>Defarge looks confused. His name is Ernest, not Jacques. He would thank the visitor to use his name. It\u2019s more than enough for him.<PARAGRAPH>The spy (he\u2019s a spy, in case you haven\u2019t figured it out) is getting more and more confused.<PARAGRAPH>He tries to draw both the Defarges into conversation about the woes of the people, but they say that they spend all their time running the wine-shop.<PARAGRAPH>There\u2019s just no time to pay attention to the populace and its discontents.<PARAGRAPH>The spy does manage to get one good blow in, though. He mentions Dr. Manette.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge immediately jumps a little bit.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge quickly says that they never see nor hear from the doctor.<PARAGRAPH>Smiling, the spy says he knows. In fact, the doctor is in England.<PARAGRAPH>Interestingly, his daughter is about to marry a man whose original name is\u2026well, not Darnay.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he\u2019s taken his mother\u2019s name. In French, it would be D\u2019Aulnais.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge gasps.<PARAGRAPH>His wife knits ferociously.<PARAGRAPH>When the spy asks if anything is the matter, she says that it would be better for the daughter of Dr. Manette if her husband-to-be never returned to France.<PARAGRAPH>The spy leaves.<PARAGRAPH>Silence descends on the house.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge hesitates, then asks Madame Defarge if it wouldn\u2019t be a horrible thing that the son-in-law of Dr. Manette were registered alongside the spy.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, she doesn\u2019t think it would be a bad thing at all.<PARAGRAPH>Saddened, Defarge leaves. As he goes upstairs, he thinks about what a \"frightfully\" grand woman his wife is.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-16"}
