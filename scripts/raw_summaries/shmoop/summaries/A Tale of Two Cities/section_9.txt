{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Four \u2013 Congratulatory", "summary": "As Lucie and her father step out of the courtroom, our narrator takes some time to catch us up on their lives.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Manette is  looking worlds better.<PARAGRAPH>Our narrator is pretty sure that this is all Lucie\u2019s doing: she's brought him back to life.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone congratulates everyone else on Darnay\u2019s release.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Stryver, Darnay\u2019s lawyer, seems to be taking most of the credit for the legal maneuver that saved his life.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, that would be forgetting Carton\u2019s role in the affair\u2014which our narrator wouldn\u2019t want us to do.<PARAGRAPH>Unsurprisingly, pointing out the similarity between Carton and Darnay was Carton\u2019s own idea. He was  the brains behind the operation.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry asks if \"a man of business\" might now approach Charles Darnay.<PARAGRAPH>As we quickly realize, however, anytime Mr. Lorry wants to be a \"man of business,\" it rarely works well.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s soon congratulating Charles just like everyone else.<PARAGRAPH>Carton, who still seems pretty cynical about the justice system  (hmm\u2026wonder why?), wants to get out of the general area of the court.<PARAGRAPH>He asks Darnay to come out to dinner with him.<PARAGRAPH>Aww\u2026a blossoming friendship?<PARAGRAPH>Well, not exactly. Darnay can\u2019t seem to break through Carton\u2019s cynicism. And Carton\u2019s already seen how Darnay looks at Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, just because Carton seems to like  rubbing salt in his own wounds, he gets Darnay to propose a toast to \"Miss Manette!\"<PARAGRAPH>After sharing a drink or two together, Carton\u2019s pretty sure he doesn\u2019t like Darnay.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay sure doesn\u2019t like Carton.<PARAGRAPH>Perhaps they might even get into blows over Lucie\u2026until, of course, Darnay realizes that Carton has just saved his life.<PARAGRAPH>Before they part, however, Darnay wants to know why Carton seems so angry and depressed.<PARAGRAPH>Muttering that he\u2019s a \"disappointed drudge,\" Carton says that he\u2019s been worth nothing all his life.<PARAGRAPH>As Darnay leaves, Carton engages in a little bit of existential self-questioning.<PARAGRAPH>Why hasn\u2019t he been able to change his own circumstances in life? Why isn\u2019t he ever able to change his ways or become a better human being?<PARAGRAPH>Tough questions. And Carton\u2019s got no answers.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-4"}
