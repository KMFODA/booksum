Do you really?<PARAGRAPH>If not, where does that leave you? Sad and lonely? Exactly.<PARAGRAPH>Our narrator starts out this chapter with some cheerful reflections.<PARAGRAPH>You don\u2019t know the people you love. Not really. Hey, we don\u2019t know the people we love.  Every man is an island. It\u2019s all very existential.<PARAGRAPH>Actually, it\u2019s all very good writing, as well. We totally recommend that you check it out. It\u2019s only about a paragraph long.<PARAGRAPH>The synopsis, though, is this: death sucks so badly because it forces us to realize how much we don\u2019t know about the people around us.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, Jerry (the deliverer of the message from the last chapter) is sitting in an alehouse, puzzling over the meaning of his latest assignment.<PARAGRAPH>He can\u2019t figure out the message that he\u2019s supposed to deliver, at all. Nonetheless, he decides to set off to London to deliver it.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, the mail coach rattles its way down the road to Dover.<PARAGRAPH>Inside, Mr. Lorry dozes as he thinks. All of the sounds in the mail coach begin to sound like the sounds he knows so well\u2014the sounds of Tellson's bank.<PARAGRAPH>Despite the comforting sounds of the bank, however, Mr. Lorry remains uneasy.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s uneasy because he\u2019s been given a difficult task: he\u2019s about to dig up the dead.<PARAGRAPH>Ugh! Wait, isn\u2019t that illegal?<PARAGRAPH>Well, yes. But that\u2019s not the sort of digging we\u2019re talking about. We\u2019ll get to that later.<PARAGRAPH>For now, though, Mr. Lorry imagines a conversation that he has with the dead.<PARAGRAPH>He asks the dead man if he\u2019s been recalled to life; the dead man says that he doesn\u2019t know.<PARAGRAPH>He asks the dead man if he\u2019d like to see \"her.\"<PARAGRAPH>The man has a different answer for each time Mr. Lorry imagines the conversation. Sometimes he\u2019s very happy, other times he\u2019s almost angry.<PARAGRAPH>Playing the conversation out in his head over and over again, Mr. Lorry finally asks the dead man how long he\u2019s been buried.<PARAGRAPH>The answer, \"eighteen years,\" terrifies Mr. Lorry.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-1-chapter-3"}
