{"name": "Volume III, Chapter Five \u2013 The Wood-Sawyer", "summary": "A year passes. Then another three months pass. Nothing\u2019s changed.<PARAGRAPH>Lucie, in particular, seems to have weathered the calamity pretty well.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s not wearing bright, fancy clothes, sure, but otherwise she\u2019s cheerful.<PARAGRAPH>Only occasionally does her grief break through. Then she cries on her father\u2019s shoulder all night.<PARAGRAPH>He remains confident that he can save Darnay and tries to reassure his daughter as much as he can.<PARAGRAPH>One day, the doctor comes home with some news: every now and then, Darnay can make his way to a little window that looks out onto the street.<PARAGRAPH>He usually manages to be there at three in the afternoon. It\u2019s not every day\u2026in fact, it\u2019s only about once a week.<PARAGRAPH>Nonetheless, he asked if Lucie would be willing to come stand in front of the window at three o'clock so he could see her.<PARAGRAPH>From that time on, Lucie goes to the street next to the window every afternoon.<PARAGRAPH>Whatever the weather\u2019s like, she stands outside for two hours.<PARAGRAPH>Talk about devotion, huh?<PARAGRAPH>We\u2019re not the only ones who notice how devoted Lucie is.<PARAGRAPH>A woodcutter happens to realize that she\u2019s standing on his street every day.<PARAGRAPH>At first, he greets her and she returns the greeting.<PARAGRAPH>After a bit, though, he begins to make jokes about the guillotine. Unsurprisingly, Lucie doesn\u2019t find them very funny.<PARAGRAPH>He thinks it\u2019s a riot, though. He even makes a miniature version of the guillotine and hangs it outside his window.<PARAGRAPH>Honestly, we think the guy needs some hobbies of his own.<PARAGRAPH>One day, he\u2019s not in his shop.<PARAGRAPH>Lucie\u2019s relieved\u2014until she sees him dancing with The Vengeance and a mob of hundreds of other people.<PARAGRAPH>They\u2019re dancing a wild, bloody, violent dance. Apparently, it involves lots of teeth-gnashing. It\u2019s called the Carmagnole.<PARAGRAPH>Lucie stares at them, frightened. Her father comes up to lead her away, and she asks him about the horrible dance.<PARAGRAPH>He tries to calm her, although he\u2019s seen it several times before.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, Madame Defarge appears right beside them.<PARAGRAPH>She disappears as quickly as she came.<PARAGRAPH>As they walk home, Dr. Manette tells Lucie that Darnay has been summoned to the Tribunal. He\u2019s supposed to have a trial tomorrow.<PARAGRAPH>In the distance, they hear the guillotine chopping off three heads.<PARAGRAPH>We sure hope that this isn\u2019t foreshadowing.<PARAGRAPH>The doctor leaves Lucie at home and heads off to see Mr. Lorry to make plans for the next day.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-3-chapter-5"}
