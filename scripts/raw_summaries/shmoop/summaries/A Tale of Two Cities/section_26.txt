{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Twenty-One \u2013 Echoing Footsteps", "summary": "The years pass.<PARAGRAPH>Lucie has a baby girl. She\u2019s also named Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>She also has a small baby boy who dies when he\u2019s just a few years old.<PARAGRAPH>Surprisingly, Sydney Carton has become a much-loved uncle to the children.<PARAGRAPH>His footsteps continually sound on the Manettes\u2019 doorstep.<PARAGRAPH>Even more frequently, they\u2019re heard pacing in the streets and alleys around the Manettes\u2019 house.<PARAGRAPH>Get it? Footsteps? It\u2019s just like the title of the chapter.<PARAGRAPH>When Lucie\u2019s son dies, his last words are about Carton. He asks his mother and sister to give Carton a kiss for him.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Stryver, our least favorite lawyer, has gotten richer and fatter as the years have passed.<PARAGRAPH>He marries a rich, pudgy wife. They have three chubby, annoying children.<PARAGRAPH>Okay, so  Dickens isn\u2019t so nice about people\u2019s weight. Nonetheless, the Stryvers aren\u2019t that great.<PARAGRAPH>Stryver,  in his extreme beneficence, wants Darnay to tutor his kids.<PARAGRAPH>Unsurprisingly, Darnay declines to do so.<PARAGRAPH>Stryver\u2019s a bit peeved. He contents himself, however, with telling his wife stories about how Lucie once was desperate to marry him.<PARAGRAPH>Ah,  memory can play funny tricks on us, eh?<PARAGRAPH>Throughout this whole time, Lucie\u2019s been the angel in the Manette house. (See Lucie\u2019s \"Character Analysis\" for more on this.)<PARAGRAPH>She manages to be everywhere all the time and helps everybody all the time.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s pretty amazing, actually. Maybe even impossible.<PARAGRAPH>By the time little Lucie gets to be six, things in the Manette house have adjusted into smooth, well-ordered happiness.<PARAGRAPH>Things in France, however, aren\u2019t going so swimmingly.<PARAGRAPH>The footsteps that sound in Saint Antoine are fast and furious.<PARAGRAPH>They race through the night, gathering weapons and spreading news.<PARAGRAPH>The Defarges' wine-shop remains the center of all the revolutionary activity.<PARAGRAPH>As all the Jacqueses get ready to go to war, Madame Defarge rallies the women.<PARAGRAPH>Together, they storm the Bastille.<PARAGRAPH>The Bastille, you remember, is the prison where the French government kept its political prisoners.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s also the place where Dr. Manette spent a good bit of his life.<PARAGRAPH>On July 14, 1789, the revolutionaries take over the fortress. (FYI: this actually happened. Head to our \"Setting\" page for more information.)<PARAGRAPH>Our narrator goes a little crazy describing the sights, sounds, and noises of the attack on the Bastille.<PARAGRAPH>Cannons boom, women shriek, and blood runs everywhere.<PARAGRAPH>Soon, the revolutionaries are running through the halls of the Bastille, crying out for the prisoners and the records that the Bastille still stores.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge grabs a man in the prison and demands to be shown to the North Tower.<PARAGRAPH>Why is he so insistent? Well, for one thing, Dr. Manette was a prisoner in the North Tower.<PARAGRAPH>Taking Jacques Three along with him, he heads up the stairs to cell One Hundred and Five.<PARAGRAPH>Once in the cell, he asks Jacques Three to run a torch along the wall.<PARAGRAPH>Sure enough, he eventually finds the initials \"A.M.\" etched in the wall.<PARAGRAPH>A.M. stands for Alexandre Manette.<PARAGRAPH>That\u2019s Dr. Manette to us.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge suddenly orders the men with him to rip apart the room.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s looking for something\u2026.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, he orders the men to set all the fragments of furniture on fire.<PARAGRAPH>Delighted to have more to destroy, they immediately follow orders.<PARAGRAPH>Outside, the crowd has captured the governor who defended the Bastille.<PARAGRAPH>They\u2019re supposed to wait for Defarge to emerge so they can march the governor back to the wine-shop.<PARAGRAPH>As the guy passes through the crowd, however, he gets beaten and knifed.<PARAGRAPH>Soon he falls over, dead of his wounds.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge, shouting triumphantly, steps on him and cuts off his head.<PARAGRAPH>Looks like he\u2019s not going back to the wine-shop, after all.<PARAGRAPH>The mobs from Saint Antoine decide to behead some guards and hoist their heads onto pikes.<PARAGRAPH>So that\u2019s exactly what they do.<PARAGRAPH>Seven prisoners were released; seven other men\u2019s heads stand on pikes.<PARAGRAPH>Fair\u2019s fair, right?", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-21"}
