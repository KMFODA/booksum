{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Three \u2013 A Disappointment", "summary": "Dickens cuts right to the heart of the action: Mr. Attorney-General, the head of the state\u2019s case against Charles Darnay, is in the middle of his argument.<PARAGRAPH>We know that he\u2019s in the middle of the argument because every sentence in his argument begins with \"that.\" In other words, we\u2019re not exactly hearing him speak. We\u2019re overhearing him speak.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s a neat little trick on Dickens\u2019 part: he doesn\u2019t want us to agree with Mr. Attorney General, so he uses third-person narration instead of representing his speech.<PARAGRAPH>But back to the speech: Mr. Attorney-General thinks that the prisoner (that\u2019s Darnay) has been engaging in a very long and treasonous correspondence with the French.<PARAGRAPH>The French? Ack! Gasp!<PARAGRAPH>Hey, wait\u2026why does the British government care about the French?<PARAGRAPH>Well, the French were actually involved in a  nifty little battle on the other side of the Atlantic: the American Revolution.<PARAGRAPH>Anybody who carried information from Britain to France probably had their hands in the American Revolution, as well.<PARAGRAPH>That\u2019s what the Attorney-General thinks, at least. He\u2019s going to try to hang Darnay.<PARAGRAPH>After Mr. Attorney-General gets done talking, his partner, Mr. Solicitor-General, gets up to examine the state\u2019s first witness.<PARAGRAPH>John Barsad, a \"gentleman,\" swears that he\u2019s not a spy, and that he makes his own living (although no one seems to know where his money comes from) as an honest man.<PARAGRAPH>He also swears that Charles Darnay hired him as an odd-jobs man once when Darnay was traveling by boat to France.<PARAGRAPH>Barsad testifies that Darnay carried lists from France to England and from England to France.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, he doesn\u2019t really specify what those lists contained\u2014but then, when you\u2019re trying a traitor,  you don\u2019t really need that many details, do you?<PARAGRAPH>The state calls Mr. Jarvis Lorry to the stand.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry testifies that he traveled to France by boat five years ago.<PARAGRAPH>He did see two other people on the boat, but he can\u2019t say that he can identify Darnay as one of the two men.<PARAGRAPH>The court calls Miss Manette to the stand.<PARAGRAPH>Let\u2019s pause while the entire court checks her out.<PARAGRAPH>Sigh\u2026she\u2019s so, so pretty.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Darnay is checking her out, too. She exchanges sympathetic looks with him.<PARAGRAPH>When Lucie begins to testify, it\u2019s obvious that she doesn\u2019t want to say anything that could incriminate Darnay.<PARAGRAPH>Lucie says that Darnay helped her father when Dr. Manette fell ill on the boat.<PARAGRAPH>Against her will, she also testifies that Darnay exchanged some papers with Frenchmen who were aboard the boat.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Darnay also made some jokes about George Washington while he and Lucie were chatting.<PARAGRAPH>It was all in good fun at the time, but now the court doesn\u2019t take it so lightly.<PARAGRAPH>The court, in fact, seems to think that making jokes about how George Washington might not be such a bad guy is, in fact, treason.<PARAGRAPH>Lucie\u2019s testimony, in other words, didn\u2019t go all that well for Darnay.<PARAGRAPH>Next, it\u2019s Dr. Manette\u2019s turn on the stand.<PARAGRAPH>He says that he\u2019s been told he was on a ship traveling from France to England, but he can\u2019t remember anything from that time.<PARAGRAPH>Another witness gets called to the stand to affirm that Darnay stayed at a hotel about twelve miles from the coast on the night that he traveled to England.<PARAGRAPH>Okay, okay, we know it\u2019s getting technical. Bear with us for a second, though.<PARAGRAPH>While the prisoner\u2019s lawyer is cross-examining this witness, a man in the court passes the lawyer a note.<PARAGRAPH>All of a sudden, the lawyer has a new course of attack.<PARAGRAPH>He asks the witness if he\u2019s ever seen anyone who could be confused with Darnay.<PARAGRAPH>Confused, the witness says no.<PARAGRAPH>Pointing with a dramatic flourish to the other end of the room, the lawyer says, \"Not even that man?\"<PARAGRAPH>Gasp!<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Sydney Carton (the man in the corner) looks exactly like Mr. Darnay.<PARAGRAPH>A coincidence, you say?<PARAGRAPH>Well, yes. But this is a novel. Anything can happen, folks.  Just ride with it.<PARAGRAPH>The court case goes on for a while as lawyers try and  re-try (and re-try) different theories.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, however, Carton points out that Lucie is fainting.<PARAGRAPH>(How does he notice before anyone else? Well,  we\u2019re guessing that he\u2019s been staring. It\u2019s not polite, we know, but for now we\u2019re overlooking it.)<PARAGRAPH>By this point, the case is pretty much over.<PARAGRAPH>Carton\u2019s appearance has introduced too much doubt into the trial.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay is acquitted.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry Cruncher is astonished.<PARAGRAPH>Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t have much time to stay astonished. Mr. Lorry sends him back to the bank with the news.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-3"}
