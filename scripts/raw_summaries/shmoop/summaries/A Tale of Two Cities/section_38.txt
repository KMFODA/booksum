{"name": "Volume III, Chapter Nine \u2013 The Game Made", "summary": "While Carton and Barsad are talking in the next room, Mr. Lorry sits in silence.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s staring at Jerry Cruncher. Hard.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, he asks what Jerry does besides working at Tellson\u2019s.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry says that his work is \"agricultural\" in nature.<PARAGRAPH>We\u2019re guessing that\u2019s because  it involves dirt. Oh, and bodies. Lots of dead bodies.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry isn\u2019t fooled.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he\u2019s angry. If Jerry\u2019s been using the respectable name of Tellson\u2019s as a front for illegal activities, then Mr. Lorry will terminate his position as soon as they all get back to London.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry takes deep offense to this.<PARAGRAPH>He has an amazing speech about moral relativism that he gives here. It\u2019s so good that we suggest you read it yourselves.<PARAGRAPH>Basically, he says that what he does isn\u2019t so bad\u2026if only because everyone else does bad things, too.<PARAGRAPH>Carton and Barsad come into the room, and Jerry and Barsad leave.<PARAGRAPH>Left alone with Carton, Mr. Lorry asks what sort of deal Barsad made.<PARAGRAPH>Carton says that he\u2019s managed to make sure that someone can get in to see Darnay, just once, if things go very poorly at the trial.<PARAGRAPH>He didn\u2019t want to ask for anything more: it\u2019s a bit perilous in the prison these days.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry starts to tear up a bit at the thought of the danger ahead.<PARAGRAPH>Carton says that Mr. Lorry is a good man and a true friend.<PARAGRAPH>Abruptly, he asks if Mr. Lorry is heading over to see Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>Carton doesn\u2019t want her to know that he\u2019s here. Mr. Lorry agrees to keep it a secret.<PARAGRAPH>Staring into the fire, Carton asks Mr. Lorry if he has led a good life.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry says that he\u2019s an old bachelor\u2014no one would weep if he died.<PARAGRAPH>Carton scoffs at that. She would weep for him!<PARAGRAPH>As they get up to go, Mr. Lorry says that he\u2019s an old man\u2026but Carton is still very young.<PARAGRAPH>Carton smiles sadly. He\u2019s young, sure, but he\u2019s not made for the age that he lives in.<PARAGRAPH>They each go their separate ways. Mr. Lorry heads to the Manettes\u2019 place. Carton goes to a small woodworking shop in Saint Antoine.<PARAGRAPH>He stands outside it, and the wood sawyer comes out to see him.<PARAGRAPH>The wood sawyer seems astonished at the resemblance between Carton and the prisoner.<PARAGRAPH>He also comments on Carton\u2019s perfect French.<PARAGRAPH>Next, Carton heads to a chemist. He buys two different drugs.<PARAGRAPH>The pharmacist warns him that combining the two would be fatal.<PARAGRAPH>We\u2019re beginning to suspect that Carton has some sort of plan here\u2026<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s already midnight. Carton walks through the streets of Paris all night, thinking of his childhood.<PARAGRAPH>He was orphaned at an early age. He\u2019s never felt at home anywhere.<PARAGRAPH>By morning, he\u2019s back at Mr. Lorry\u2019s door.<PARAGRAPH>Together, they head to the Tribunal.<PARAGRAPH>Today, one of the judges is Jacques Three, the most bloodthirsty of all the Jacques.<PARAGRAPH>There\u2019s a huge audience in the court as the judges call Charles Evr\u00e9monde to the stand.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s been denounced by three people: M. and Mme. Defarge, and Dr. Manette.<PARAGRAPH>Wait\u2026what? Dr. Manette?<PARAGRAPH>The doctor seems as shocked as the rest of the court.<PARAGRAPH>He cries out that the accusation is a mistake.<PARAGRAPH>The judges, however, rebuke him. Nothing could be dearer to him than the fate of the Republic, right?<PARAGRAPH>He doesn\u2019t seem to agree. Then again, they don\u2019t seem to care what he thinks.<PARAGRAPH>The court calls Defarge to the stand. They ask him if he was one of the patriots who stormed the Bastille.<PARAGRAPH>The Vengeance, who\u2019s sitting in the front row, shrieks that he\u2019s a French hero.<PARAGRAPH>Honestly, the woman is beginning to irritate us a little bit.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge, however, agrees. He says that he found a letter hidden in the walls of the Bastille\u2026a letter written by Alexandre Manette during his imprisonment.<PARAGRAPH>The courtroom gasps.<PARAGRAPH>The judges order that the letter be read aloud.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-3-chapter-9"}
