{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Ten \u2013 Two Promises", "summary": "Back in England, Charles Darnay, ex-French aristocrat, is making a decent living as a tutor.<PARAGRAPH>What does he teach? French, of course.<PARAGRAPH>Everything\u2019s  coming up roses for him.<PARAGRAPH>Sure, it\u2019s not as lucrative as a decades-old title, but he\u2019s making honest pay for an honest day\u2019s work.<PARAGRAPH>Also, he\u2019s madly in love with Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>That is what\u2019s top on his mind as he heads over to Soho to the Manettes\u2019 house.<PARAGRAPH>The doctor is at home.<PARAGRAPH>His life has only continued to improve. He\u2019s working all the time, which makes him pretty happy.<PARAGRAPH>He hasn\u2019t relapsed into depression or memory loss in a long time.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay walks into the room, and Dr. Manette greets him happily.<PARAGRAPH>They haven\u2019t seen each other in a few days: Darnay has been busy working with his students, and the doctor has his patients.<PARAGRAPH>The doctor remarks that it\u2019s unfortunate that Lucie isn\u2019t around to greet him, as well.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay cuts him short. He knew that Lucie wasn\u2019t in.<PARAGRAPH>Sensing that this will be a conversation that he won\u2019t like, Dr. Manette asks Darnay to remember how essential Lucie is to his well-being.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay says he understands. He wouldn\u2019t mention her name\u2014but he loves her too much to keep quiet any longer.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Manette already knows this.<PARAGRAPH>He asks Darnay if Darnay has said anything about his love to Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay says that he\u2019d never approach Lucie without telling Dr. Manette first. In fact, that\u2019s why he\u2019s here.<PARAGRAPH>Aww\u2026what a gentleman, huh?<PARAGRAPH>Explaining that he understands how important Lucie is in Dr. Manette\u2019s life, Darnay says that he\u2019ll never do anything that would jeopardize their relationship. In fact, if he married Lucie, he\u2019d want to move in with them.<PARAGRAPH>That way, their house would be disrupted as little as possible.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Manette asks if Darnay wants him to say anything to Lucie about this conversation.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay immediately refuses.<PARAGRAPH>He knows how much Dr. Manette\u2019s opinion matters to Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>If he told her to jump, she\u2019d ask \"How high?\"<PARAGRAPH>Okay, that\u2019s not actually in the book.<PARAGRAPH>But if he told her to consider Darnay as a husband, she\u2019d marry him\u2014without thinking about whether or not she loved him.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay doesn\u2019t want this. He asks Dr. Manette not to say anything.<PARAGRAPH>What he does ask, however, is that Dr. Manette agree to tell Lucie of this conversation if she comes to her father to talk about Darnay.<PARAGRAPH>In the interests of full disclosure, Darnay also wants to tell Dr. Manette about his past\u2026in France.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Manette seems startled. He immediately shuts Darnay down.<PARAGRAPH>He doesn\u2019t want to know about Darnay\u2019s history.<PARAGRAPH>Okay, okay: if Lucie and Darnay get married, then Darnay can tell him about his past. But that\u2019s a big if.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay leaves, happy with their conversation.<PARAGRAPH>A few hours later, Lucie returns from her shopping trip.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Pross meets her at the door.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s frantic. Ever since Darnay left, Dr. Manette has been up in his room, pacing the way that he used to. And he\u2019s been working at making shoes again.<PARAGRAPH>He won\u2019t come down. In fact, he doesn\u2019t seem to hear her when she calls.<PARAGRAPH>Lucie runs upstairs.<PARAGRAPH>Their voices are heard upstairs. Eventually the two come down; she convinces her father to fall asleep.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-10"}
