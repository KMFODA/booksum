He\u2019s a bit confused.<PARAGRAPH>Angry, Soloman wants to know what Miss Pross wants.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Pross, teary-eyed, introduces Soloman to Jerry as her beloved brother.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, our narrator is quick to tell us that Soloman stole Miss Pross\u2019 money and then pretended to be dead...but she doesn\u2019t know that yet.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, Jerry takes an interest in Soloman.<PARAGRAPH>As he remembers it, however, Soloman wasn\u2019t his name back in England.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he thinks that Soloman used to be a spy. He was supposed to have died.<PARAGRAPH>What was the name Soloman used to use?<PARAGRAPH>While Jerry thinks, a new voice breaks into the conversation.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s Sydney Carton. He informs Jerry that Solomon\u2019s old name was Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>Carton reassures Miss Pross that everything is all right. He showed up a day ago; he\u2019s been to see Mr. Lorry and he\u2019s now trying to be of some help to the Manettes.<PARAGRAPH>Now, though, he\u2019s here to see Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently Soloman/Barsad has become a spy in the French prisons.<PARAGRAPH>Carton explains that he\u2019d like to have a conversation with Barsad at Mr. Lorry\u2019s.<PARAGRAPH>When Barsad seems inclined to say no, Carton gently tells him that he has information that could make life pretty sticky for Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>That changes Barsad\u2019s mind!<PARAGRAPH>Miss Pross, however, is worried. She begs Carton to protect her brother.<PARAGRAPH>Carton promises.<PARAGRAPH>At Mr. Lorry\u2019s, Carton introduces Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>Next, he breaks the bad news to Mr. Lorry: Darnay has been arrested again.<PARAGRAPH>Not to worry, though: Carton has a plan.<PARAGRAPH>To make the plan work, though, he needs Barsad\u2019s help.<PARAGRAPH>As we may have mentioned, Barsad isn\u2019t exactly the helping sort.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he needs quite a bit of convincing.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, however, Carton  has some dirt on Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>Barsad has been spying on the prisoners for the French revolutionaries, but he\u2019s also been spying on the French for the English.<PARAGRAPH>No one likes a double-crossing spy.<PARAGRAPH>Moreover, Carton knows that Barsad\u2019s friend is passing as a Frenchman\u2014but he\u2019s really an Englishman, Roger Cly.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry suddenly pays close attention. He wants to know why Roger Cly never got properly buried.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he asks Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>Barsad can\u2019t figure out how Jerry would know this\u2026until Jerry informs them that he tried to dig Roger up. In Roger\u2019s place, however, he found an empty coffin.<PARAGRAPH>Barsad knows that Carton\u2019s managed to beat him in this particular game.<PARAGRAPH>Now that he gets the point, Barsad wants to know what Carton wants from him.<PARAGRAPH>As it turns out, Carton doesn\u2019t want much. Barsad is a keyholder of the prison. He can pass in and out at will, right?<PARAGRAPH>Barsad agrees. He\u2019s able to go into the prison whenever he likes.<PARAGRAPH>Carton nods, then asks Barsad to step into the next room so they can have a word together in private.<PARAGRAPH>...and, unfortunately, we don\u2019t get to read about that particular conversation.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-3-chapter-8"}
