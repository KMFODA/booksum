He can live or die\u2026she doesn\u2019t mind either way.<PARAGRAPH>Lucie and her child, however, must be exterminated.<PARAGRAPH>All of the Evr\u00e9monde race must die.<PARAGRAPH>Jacques Three thinks gleefully about how pretty Lucie\u2019s golden hair will look at the base of La Guillotine.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge swears her two companions to secrecy. Her husband can\u2019t know about their plans.<PARAGRAPH>Now Madame Defarge calls over the wood-sawyer and makes him promise that he\u2019ll testify that Lucie was exchanging traitorous signals with the prisoner Evr\u00e9monde.<PARAGRAPH>Happy to help the revolution, the guy agrees.<PARAGRAPH>We\u2019re sensing that this isn\u2019t exactly the best display of justice in action.<PARAGRAPH>Perhaps that\u2019s what Dickens intended us to think.<PARAGRAPH>At any rate, Madame Defarge is pretty happy with the way things are shaping up.<PARAGRAPH>Confident that Lucie will be pretty angry at the Republic right now (after all, her husband\u2019s being executed), Madame Defarge decides to pay her a visit.<PARAGRAPH>Perhaps she can get Lucie to say something that will damn her whole family to death.<PARAGRAPH>The Vengeance can\u2019t get enough of how marvelous Madame Defarge\u2019s plans and revolutionary fervor are.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge stalks through the streets.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s a cold, cold woman.<PARAGRAPH>She cares nothing about love\u2014only about vengeance.
