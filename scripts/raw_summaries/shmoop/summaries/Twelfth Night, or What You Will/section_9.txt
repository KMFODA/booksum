{"name": "Act 2, Scene 5", "summary": "In Olivia's garden, Toby and Aguecheek hang out with Fabian, who worries that he'll get in trouble again if he helps them trick Malvolio. Seems Malvolio told on Fabian earlier for holding a bear-baiting contest at Olivia's place. (Bear-baiting was a popular Elizabethan blood sport, where bears were tied up to a stake and forced to fight unleashed dogs.)<PARAGRAPH>Toby Belch says not to worry\u2014they'll make Malvolio pay for being such a drag.<PARAGRAPH>Maria enters and tells the men Malvolio has been hanging out alone practicing acting super cool for the past half hour.<PARAGRAPH>Now he's headed this way, and she knows the letter she wrote is going to make him act like an even bigger fool. She tells everyone to hide behind a tree and put the letter on the ground for Malvolio to find.<PARAGRAPH>Malvolio enters the garden talking to himself. First he says he thinks Maria wants him and then he fantasizes about being married to Olivia, which would make him a Count who could boss around Sir Toby and his raucous little crew. Toby and Aguecheek can hardly contain their laughter and their anger at Malvolio's audacity.<PARAGRAPH>The fantasy continues as Malvolio daydreams about fondling some expensive jewels and lecturing Toby for his drunkenness.<PARAGRAPH>Malvolio finds the letter and thinks right away that it's written in Olivia's handwriting. He thinks the letter is meant for him because it spells out M-A-O-I, all letters that appear in the name Malvolio. (Boy, that's some cracker-jack detective work.)<PARAGRAPH>The letter instructs Malvolio to pick fights with Toby and company, wear yellow stockings with cross-garters, and smile at everything, even when Olivia's in a sad mood. Malvolio is all over this and runs off to change his clothes.<PARAGRAPH>Toby is psyched \u2013 Maria's plot is so clever that he's tempted to marry her.<PARAGRAPH>Maria enters and gloats about her evil genius plan. Malvolio is sure to make a fool of himself while annoying Olivia to no end.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210415161814/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/twelfth-night/summary/act-2-scene-5"}
