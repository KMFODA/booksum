{"name": "Chapter 20", "summary": "As Dimmesdale heads back to town, he glances back at Hester and Pearl, half-expecting that he just imagined the whole thing.<PARAGRAPH>Nope. Still there.<PARAGRAPH>He thinks about how they wanted to return to  the Old World, and remember that there's actually a ship in the harbor at that exact moment, just waiting to sail for Bristol, England.<PARAGRAPH>Hester has met the captain and crew, so she should be able to secure passage for two adults and a child.<PARAGRAPH>They'll sail in four days, which will give Dimmesdale just enough time to leave his career on a high note by preaching his final sermon, the Election Sermon.<PARAGRAPH>(Quick Brain Snack: the \"Election Sermon\" was a sermon that basically meditated on the religious and civil duties of elected officials (and those who elect them) as allegedly laid out in the Bible. Pretty important stuff in a mid-17th century Puritan community.)<PARAGRAPH>When Dimmesdale gets back to town, though, he feels\u2026 weird.<PARAGRAPH>When he meets a deacon in the church, he almost  blurts out some really blasphemous things.<PARAGRAPH>He even\u2014prepare yourself\u2014thinks about arguing against the immortality of the soul.<PARAGRAPH>Gasp!<PARAGRAPH>And when he meets a new church member,  he totally blows her off\u2014making her wonder what she's done wrong.<PARAGRAPH>Oh, and he's tempted to teach some naughty words to some Puritan children playing by the road.<PARAGRAPH>He wonders if he is mad. Did he make a contract with the devil in the forest?<PARAGRAPH>Eh, we've all been there. Right?<PARAGRAPH>Just then, he passes the witch-lady Mistress Hibbins.<PARAGRAPH>She gives him a knowing smile and tell him to let her know next time he heads off into the woods, and she'll come along too.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, why doesn't join her at midnight in the forest, i.e., come to one of her fun witch parties?<PARAGRAPH>Now Dimmesdale is getting pretty nervous, wondering if he actually has sold his soul to the devil.<PARAGRAPH>Uh, actually, yes: the narrator says that deliberately choosing to sin is pretty much like dealing with the devil.<PARAGRAPH>\"Wicked mortals\" have a lot in common with \"perverted spirits\" (20.17).<PARAGRAPH>Back at his house, Dimmesdale is studying the Election Sermon (which he obviously wrote pre-encounter in the woods, since we'd hate to see what he came up with post-encounter), when Chillingworth comes in.<PARAGRAPH>Does he need medicinal strength for his sermon?<PARAGRAPH>Nope. In fact, he doesn't need any more of Chillingworth's drugs.<PARAGRAPH>Chillingworth mulls this over for a bit, and Dimmesdale starts to worry that he knows about the moment in the woods.<PARAGRAPH>He doesn't. But he does realize that Dimmesdale knows Chillingworth has it in for him. After a little back-and-forth about the medicine, Chillingworth finally leaves.<PARAGRAPH>Alone, Dimmesdale throws his Election Sermon in the fire and  pulls an all-nighter writing a new one.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211014221130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/scarlet-letter/summary/chapter-20"}
