{"name": "Act III, Scene ii", "summary": "Still at E. Antipholus\u2019s house, the confusion we\u2019ve just seen outside is almost as bad as the confusion going on inside. Remember S. Antipholus has just had dinner with Adriana (E. Antipholus\u2019s wife) and Luciana (Adriana\u2019s sister). Dinner must\u2019ve been pretty good (and merrily drunk), because S. Antipholus has presently declared his love for Luciana. Of course, this is complicated by the fact that Luciana thinks her brother-in-law is coming onto her. (Awkward!!!)<PARAGRAPH>Luciana wonders just how E. Antipholus can turn from loving his wife to being so unfaithful. She says Antipholus may have married her sister for money, but she wishes he\u2019d be better to her for the money\u2019s sake, then. Luciana doesn\u2019t tell him to be faithful, exactly. Instead, she recommends that if he does love another, that he do it stealthily, as it\u2019s one offense to cheat on your wife, and an entirely different offense to let the poor woman know about it. According to Luciana, a man should hide his infidelity for his wife\u2019s sake.<PARAGRAPH>Luciana finally deflects S. Antipholus by saying women are gullible, and will believe what men want them to believe, especially if the men can flatter them by claiming true love.<PARAGRAPH>S. Antipholus is undeterred. Again, he wonders how Luciana even knows his name. He admits he doesn\u2019t really know her name, and decides that she must be some divine creature. He pleads with her to be his mentor, and teach him the ways of the world and himself.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, S. Antipholus rightly asserts that he has no wife, and either way, he prefers Luciana to Adriana. Besides, Adriana is inside the house crying as they speak.<PARAGRAPH>S. Antipholus wishes Luciana would do more with her power than just try to get him to love her sister. He basically declares Luciana to be the apple of his eye. Luciana is weirded out and runs off to try to comfort her sister.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, S. Dromio runs in, out of breath. S. Dromio says this woman, the unattractive kitchen wench, claims that he\u2019s her man.<PARAGRAPH>Though the girl\u2019s not appealing, she did know Dromio by name. Even creepier, she knew about all the marks and moles on his body. This is no woman to bring home to mom (if he had one), so Dromio ran from her as though she were a witch.<PARAGRAPH>S. Antipholus has clearly had enough, and his plan is to get the hell out. He sends S. Dromio to go find out if any ships are leaving immediately. He\u2019d really rather not spend the night in this creepy place that\u2019s clearly enchanted by witches and full of awful women who claim he and Dromio for their husbands. Still, S. Antipholus will be a little sad to leave Luciana, who has enchanted him.<PARAGRAPH>Now, Angelo the goldsmith shows up with E. Antipholus\u2019s gold chain for his wife. He mistakes S. Antipholus for E. Antipholus, and happily gives him the chain, so glad to meet him before he went to the Porpentine. Of course, S. Antipholus has no idea what\u2019s going on, but he doesn\u2019t refuse the necklace because it\u2019s pretty. He tries to pay Angelo on the spot, but Angelo refuses (thinking E. Antipholus will pay him later). S. Antipholus, thinking golden gifts are raining from the sky, decides to accept his gift. He\u2019ll meet Dromio at the marketplace and leave Ephesus as soon as possible.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219160210/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/comedy-of-errors/summary/act-iii-scene-ii"}
