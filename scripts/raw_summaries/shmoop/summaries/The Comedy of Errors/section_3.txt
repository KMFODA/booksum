{"name": "Act II, Scene ii", "summary": "Back at the marketplace of Ephesus, S. Antipholus is confused. He found out that the gold he sent with S. Dromio did indeed make it to the Centaur. After getting a room at the inn, S. Dromio apparently left the place in search of S. Antipholus. S. Antipholus doesn\u2019t think it makes sense that S. Antipholus has already seen S. Dromio, given the timing of the whole thing.<PARAGRAPH>When S. Antipholus does see S. Dromio (the right man), he begins to question him about his earlier (meaning E. Dromio\u2019s) requests and the whole having-a-wife-and-being-late-for-dinner business. S. Dromio is rightfully confused, and says he definitely didn\u2019t ask S. Antipholus about a wife and dinner and all that jazz. S. Dromio assures his master that this is the first time he\u2019s seen S. Antipholus since heading off to the Centaur.<PARAGRAPH>Still, S. Dromio says it\u2019s nice to see his master in such a merry, joking mood. However, S. Antipholus is upset and beats S. Dromio.<PARAGRAPH>S. Antipholus says it\u2019s fine for them to be familiar friends when S. Antipholus is in a good mood, but otherwise S. Dromio should know his place. In other words, S. Antipholus doesn\u2019t want to be teased when he\u2019s in a serious mood.<PARAGRAPH>S. Dromio and S. Antipholus now joke about S. Dromio\u2019s beating and the passage of time. Just as they\u2019re about to be pals again, S. Antipholus notices people approaching.<PARAGRAPH>Adriana and Luciana rush in all hot and bothered.<PARAGRAPH>Adriana asserts her husband is being strange; he must be divided from himself, since he is divided from her, and she\u2019s a part of him. She says separating her from him would be like separating a drop of water from a gulf\u2014so basically, they\u2019re stuck together. Adriana also points out that because of their connection, if he cheats, then she\u2019s cheating, too, which he would undoubtedly be unhappy about. Basically, while his gender may seem to absolve him of the crime of disloyalty, his adultery would leave her stained, which would in turn dishonor him.<PARAGRAPH>This has been a fine strain of logic, but poor S. Antipholus, as he\u2019s actually not her husband, is like, \"What in the world?\" He points out that unless he married Adriana in the last two hours since he arrived at Ephesus, he\u2019s not actually married to her at all.<PARAGRAPH>Adriana insists she sent E. Dromio (who she thinks she sees in S. Dromio) to bring her husband home to dinner not a few hours ago. Of course, S. Dromio says he\u2019s never seen her in his life (which is true). S. Antipholus is just as confused about how this strange woman even knows their names (because they\u2019re not using S and E initials like we are).<PARAGRAPH>Adriana continues to insist on standing by her man (or at least the guy she thinks is her man), and demands that he stand by her.<PARAGRAPH>S. Antipholus, being unable to change the woman\u2019s mind, decides he must\u2019ve married her in a dream\u2014or he\u2019s currently in a dream\u2014so the best thing to do is ride the high until he figures out what\u2019s actually going on. S. Dromio declares Ephesus is a fairyland full of bewitching things, and he too decides to roll with the confusion.<PARAGRAPH>Adriana, not to be beaten, demands that the confused S. Antipholus come with her to dinner. She charges S. Dromio to guard the gate and let nobody in. S. Antipholus follows along, given that these ladies seem to know him better than he does.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219160210/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/comedy-of-errors/summary/act-ii-scene-ii"}
