{"name": "Act 3, Scene 1", "summary": "When the scene opens, Bolingbroke has captured Bristol Castle, where Bushy and Green have been hiding out.<PARAGRAPH>Bolingbroke doesn't want there to be any confusion, so he tells everybody why he's sentencing Bushy and Green to death.<PARAGRAPH>First Bolingbroke accuses Bushy and Green of corrupting the king and coming between him and his friends and family members (including Bolingbroke).<PARAGRAPH>Then, since no political drama is complete without a sexual scandal, Bolingbroke implies that Bushy and Green both had sex with Richard, making a \"divorce betwixt his queen and him\" by breaking \"the possession of a royal bed.\"<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Bolingbroke says that Bushy and Green helped King Richard steal his land from him, which basically stripped Bolingbroke of his identity as a \"gentleman.\" (Remember, a nobleman's name and all his power come from his land.)<PARAGRAPH>Bushy and Green say they'd rather die and go to heaven than live in England with Henry Bolingbroke running around.<PARAGRAPH>Bolingbroke orders Northumberland do his dirty work for him by making sure Bushy and Green are put to death. Northumberland is all over it.<PARAGRAPH>Bolingbroke turns to York and says he wants to make sure the queen is treated fairly. (How considerate of him.)<PARAGRAPH>Then he says something like, \"Okay guys, time to get back to our uprising. If we work hard now, we can party later.\"", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201001200228/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/richard-ii/summary/act-3-scene-1"}
