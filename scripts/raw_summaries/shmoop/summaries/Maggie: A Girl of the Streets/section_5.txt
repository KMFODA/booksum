She passes the time thinking about Pete and his job, his friends, his money, and just how generally superior he is to everything in her sad-sack life.<PARAGRAPH>Anticipating Pete's next visit, Maggie spruces up the house with some drapery. Apparently it\u2014or something\u2014works, because he asks her out to see a show.<PARAGRAPH>She's all excited because everyone is afraid of him. He is clearly the Big Man on Campus, and crowds part when he comes down the sidewalk.<PARAGRAPH>Momma Mary is still getting wasted, so of course she embarrasses Maggie when Pete comes to pick her up.
