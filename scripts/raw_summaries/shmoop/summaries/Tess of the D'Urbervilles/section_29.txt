At first they don't talk.<PARAGRAPH>After a while it starts to drizzle.<PARAGRAPH>They snuggle up, and Angel takes a large piece of cloth and puts it over both of their shoulders.<PARAGRAPH>Now that they're all cozy and more-or-less dry, Angel asks her again for her reasons against marrying.<PARAGRAPH>She says she'll try to tell him before they get home.<PARAGRAPH>They pass an old manor-house, and Angel tells her it's the old seat of the D'Urbervilles\u2014remember, he still doesn't know that she's related to that family.<PARAGRAPH>Tess doesn't say much in response.<PARAGRAPH>They get to the train station, and unload the butter and milk from the cart.<PARAGRAPH>Angel asks her why she won't marry him, if she loves him.<PARAGRAPH>She says it's because of something to do with her history.<PARAGRAPH>Again, Angel almost laughs. What kind of \"history\" can a country girl like Tess have?<PARAGRAPH>Tess starts to relate the story of childhood, but when she says that her father discovered that they were D'Urbervilles, and not Durbeyfields, Angel stops her.<PARAGRAPH>He has a romantic interest in old families, because he likes the history, he tells her. He just doesn't like it when people seem to think that good blood is everything.<PARAGRAPH>He asks if her D'Urberville connection was the only objection she had to marrying him.<PARAGRAPH>She loses courage, and says yes.<PARAGRAPH>Angel thinks it's awesome that she's a D'Urberville, and is very happy that that was the only obstacle.

She says she's broken her vow never to get married.<PARAGRAPH>She calms down a bit when she realizes that her crying is hurting his feelings, and she smooches him to show him just how much she loves him.<PARAGRAPH>After this make-out session, they climb back in the cart to drive home.<PARAGRAPH>She tells him she has to write to her mother, and he asks where her mother lives.<PARAGRAPH>When she tells him, he realizes that he had seen her before\u2014at the dance on the village green.<PARAGRAPH>Tess, of course, had remembered it long since, and says that she hopes it's not a bad omen for them now, that he didn't dance with her then.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210424232301/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tess-of-the-durbervilles/summary/chapter-30"}
