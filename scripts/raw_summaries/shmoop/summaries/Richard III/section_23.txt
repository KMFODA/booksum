{"name": "Act 5, Scene 4", "summary": "As Richard is throwing around his weight, Richmond enters the scene on another part of the stage. (This is a theatrical device for indicating two faraway places \u2013 in this case, the two rival camps.)<PARAGRAPH>Richmond is also making battle preparations, but rather than rely on the weakness of his enemy (as Richard does), he constructs a careful battle plan. He calls for pen and ink so he can draft all the battle movements and asks that some of his men stay to advise him.<PARAGRAPH>Also in contrast to Richard, Richmond distributes the command among several leaders of regiments.<PARAGRAPH>Richmond's even having one of the earls come to visit him at 2am to talk shop and go over the plan.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Richmond asks Captain Blunt to find his stepfather Lord Stanley, who is half a mile from Richard's own camp and still pretending to be on Richard's side. Richmond gives Blunt a letter to deliver to Stanley before steeping himself in the battle plans and preparations.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210504161507/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/richard-iii/summary/act-5-scene-4"}
