{"name": "Act 4, Scene 3", "summary": "Pompey takes a look around the prison and declares that he feels like he's at his workplace, Mistress Overdone's brothel.  (In other words, most of Overdone's customers are now in jail.)<PARAGRAPH>Abhorson calls Barnardine out of his cell and announces that it's time for him to be executed.<PARAGRAPH>Barnardine says he was partying and drinking all night, so he's not fit to be executed right now, on account of his terrible hangover.<PARAGRAPH>Pompey says the best cure for a hangover is a good hanging because it allows one to sleep it off\u2026permanently.<PARAGRAPH>The Duke arrives in his friar disguise and offers to pray with Barnardine before he dies.<PARAGRAPH>Barnardine says he's not feeling well enough to be executed and says he's going back to his cell, but thanks anyway.<PARAGRAPH>The Duke orders Pompey and Abhorson to take Barnardine to the chopping block.<PARAGRAPH>The Duke complains to the Provost that Barnardine isn't prepared for death and it would be a \"damnable\" sin to execute a man who isn't ready to die.<PARAGRAPH>Duke Vincentio is upset because his plan to substitute Barnardine's head for Claudio's doesn't seem like it will work out. \u00a0But then the Provost reveals that a pirate who looks like Claudio just died in the prison that morning \u2013 they can cut off his head and send it to Angelo.  (Gee.  What a strange coincidence.)<PARAGRAPH>The Provost runs off to hide both Claudio and Barnardine so Angelo won't know he's being scammed.<PARAGRAPH>The Duke writes Angelo a letter announcing that he'll be back in town soon and that Angelo should meet him at a fountain in Vienna.<PARAGRAPH>The Provost returns with Ragusine's head (we now have a name for the conveniently dead pirate who looks just like Claudio) and runs off to deliver it to Angelo.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella enters the prison asking about her brother.<PARAGRAPH>For some reason, the Duke decides it's a good idea to lie and say that, sadly, Claudio has been executed.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella is crushed, but the Duke calms her down by promising that he has a plan to punish Angelo.<PARAGRAPH>The Duke gives Isabella a letter to deliver to Friar Peter and promises her that she'll be able to lodge a complaint with the Duke who is due back in Vienna any day now.  Isabella should meet with him at Mariana's house later that night.<PARAGRAPH>Lucio enters and declares that, if Duke Vincentio hadn't run off to some secret hiding place, Claudio never would have been executed.<PARAGRAPH>Lucio confesses that he once got a girl pregnant, but denied it when he was taken to court. As a result, he got off the hook without having to marry her.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210122135230/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/measure-for-measure/summary/act-4-scene-3"}
