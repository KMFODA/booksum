Amy chooses a string of gold and ebony beads, and Esther explains that it is actually a rosary \u2013 used by Catholics for saying prayers.<PARAGRAPH>Esther and Amy talk about the comfort of prayer. Esther offers to set up a little chapel for Amy in a spare room of Aunt March's mansion.<PARAGRAPH>Amy asks Esther who will get Aunt March's jewelry when she dies.

Amy adds a vase of flowers, her copy of the New Testament, her hymnbook, and a rosary that Esther gave her. She doesn't use the rosary because she's Protestant, but she hangs it in the room.<PARAGRAPH>Amy tries to use her little chapel and her prayers to replace her mother's influence and advice.
