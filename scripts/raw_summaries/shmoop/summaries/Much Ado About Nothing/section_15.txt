{"name": "Act V, Scene iii", "summary": "Claudio and Don Pedro meet in the churchyard at Hero\u2019s family tomb.<PARAGRAPH>Claudio has brought with him the epitaph that Leonato asked him to write. He reads it aloud, and it basically says (in kind of poor rhyming) that Hero was put to death by slander, and Death will try to compensate for her wrongful passing: though her life was ruined by shame, her death will be marked with fame (he\u2019s as bad as Benedick).<PARAGRAPH>Then there\u2019s more singing about how Hero was a virgin knight of that virgin goddess, the moon. Claudio announces he\u2019ll come to Hero\u2019s tomb and read (bad) poetry every year.<PARAGRAPH>Don Pedro notes that the sun is coming up. It\u2019s about the hour when they should go off and change out of their funeral clothes and into some wedding clothes, because it\u2019s party time!<PARAGRAPH>They exit, with Claudio being like, \"Man, I hope this goes better than the last time I tried to get married, like two days ago.\"", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210411203609/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/much-ado-about-nothing/summary/act-v-scene-iii"}
