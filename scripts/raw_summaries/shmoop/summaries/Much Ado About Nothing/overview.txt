{"name": "Overview", "summary": "Leonato, Governor of Messina, has just gotten word that he\u2019s to be visited by his great friend Don Pedro of Arragon, who\u2019s on his way back from battle. Beatrice, Leonato\u2019s niece, asks the messenger whether Benedick is returning. We learn that Beatrice and Benedick have been engaged in a war of wits for as long as they\u2019ve known each other, and she seems to be full of scorn for the dude.<PARAGRAPH>Don Pedro, Benedick, Claudio, and Don Pedro\u2019s illegitimate brother, Don John, arrive. Benedick and Beatrice exchange some barbs, and the sum of their interaction is that they both hate love and will never get married. (Unless they fall in love with each other and get married. Ahem.) After all the welcoming, Claudio pulls Benedick aside and reveals that he\u2019s fallen for Leonato\u2019s daughter, Hero. Benedick is full of jokes, and thinks marriage and women are bad news, especially the two combined.<PARAGRAPH>Benedick reveals Claudio\u2019s love to Don Pedro, who\u2019s more sympathetic. Left alone, Claudio confirms to Don Pedro that he\u2019d like to have Hero for his bride. Don Pedro is hyped about the idea, and says that tonight at the scheduled masquerade ball, he\u2019ll pretend to be Claudio and woo Hero on Claudio\u2019s behalf. He\u2019s certain he\u2019ll be able to secure a marriage for Claudio and Hero.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, news of the secret conversation is traveling fast around Leonato\u2019s house. Leonato\u2019s brother, Antonio, has a servant who heard some of the conversation between Don Pedro and Claudio. The servant misunderstood or misheard some of it though, so Antonio\u2019s report to Leonato is that Don Pedro intends to woo Hero for himself. Leonato goes off to prepare his daughter, Hero, for what he assumes will be a proposal of marriage from Don Pedro.<PARAGRAPH>The scene moves to Don John. He\u2019s a jerk, and he likes being a jerk. Don John\u2019s attendant, Borachio, enters with a newsy opportunity for Don John to practice some villainy while he\u2019s at Leonato\u2019s house. Borachio properly heard that Don Pedro plans to woo Hero on Claudio\u2019s behalf. The men all agree that this has great potential for their evil attentions, so they\u2019re off to flirt with some ideas for a while.<PARAGRAPH>Leonato, Hero, Beatrice, and company are getting ready for the masquerade ball after dinner. Talk turns to how Beatrice will never find a man that she likes. Beatrice teases that she\u2019s happy to be a bachelor (a gender neutral term in Shakespeare's day) for life, and even into death. Meanwhile, Hero is reminded that her father instructed her on how to return Don Pedro\u2019s affections, and we learn that Hero is generally an obedient girl.<PARAGRAPH>As the men enter in their masks, everyone pairs off with partners. Don Pedro woos Hero privately. Meanwhile, Beatrice rails about Benedick to her disguised partner (who happens to be Benedick). Don John and his crew are still up to villainy, and they corner Claudio, pretending to think he\u2019s Benedick. They suggest that Don Pedro has wooed Hero for himself. Hearing this news, Claudio declares that he should never have trusted the affairs of love to anyone else. Like a wet towel, he says goodbye to his love for Hero.<PARAGRAPH>The first part of Don John\u2019s dastardly plan is foiled when Don Pedro announces that Hero and Claudio can now get together, as he\u2019s done his job and wooed Hero on Claudio\u2019s behalf. He\u2019s explained all of this to Benedick, but Benedick is too busy being hurt by Beatrice\u2019s mean words to appreciate that Disaster Part 1 has been averted.<PARAGRAPH>As Beatrice approaches with Leonato, Hero, and Claudio, Benedick runs away to avoid further criticism from the lady. Claudio enters, sulking, and he\u2019s immediately transformed from being a taciturn emo kid into a joyous puppy when he hears the good news: Don Pedro did exactly as he promised, and a marriage is being set up between Hero and Claudio. Claudio finds out that he won\u2019t be able to marry Hero for a week, and now everyone has to figure out how to have fun during a week with no wedding and no weird courting conflicts. The answer: create weird courting conflicts. Don Pedro decides he\u2019s going to hatch a plan to get Benedick and Beatrice together, which should be entertaining (or a disaster).<PARAGRAPH>Back to the scheming Don John. Though he couldn\u2019t destroy Hero and Claudio\u2019s courtship, he\u2019s sure he can destroy their wedding. Borachio suggests that Don John convince Claudio and Don Pedro to stand in the orchard outside Hero\u2019s window on the night before the wedding. There, Borachio will be making love-talk with Hero\u2019s servant, Margaret, who he\u2019ll have dressed in Hero\u2019s clothes. From far off, the men will think the girl engaged in inappropriate window activity is Hero, and they\u2019ll write Hero off as disloyal.<PARAGRAPH>Later, Benedick is in the orchard, lamenting that one more brave soldier has fallen to the petticoats of love. Benedick notes that Claudio is changed from being a brave, straight-speaking soldier into a milquetoast (pronounced like \"milk-toast,\" and basically means what it sounds like: a piece of bread that has gotten all soggy), concerned with romantic music, fashion, and poetry. Benedick thinks he\u2019ll never undergo such a ridiculous transformation.<PARAGRAPH>Benedick hides when Don Pedro, Claudio, and Leonato approach. They see him hide, so they put their plan (to coerce him into loving Beatrice) into action. They launch into a loud, supposedly secret conversation about how Beatrice is tearing her hair out over her love for Benedick. They say Beatrice can\u2019t make her love known because she\u2019s certain that Benedick will scorn and mock her. They all leave. Benedick jumps out of the shrubbery, declaring that he can love Beatrice, and he\u2019ll prove it. Beatrice has been sent out to invite Benedick to dinner, and Benedick dotes on her, already exhibiting the first signs of luuuurve.<PARAGRAPH>Hero is in on the plan to get Beatrice and Benedick together. While Beatrice is within listening range, Hero and her attendant Ursula play the same old trick on Beatrice. They announce that they can\u2019t tell Beatrice of Benedick\u2019s love because no man can ever please Beatrice, she\u2019s such a proud and scornful woman. Once they leave, Beatrice (surprise!) has the same reaction as Benedick, and promises she\u2019ll leave her scorn behind. She\u2019ll love and marry Benedick, if he\u2019ll have her.<PARAGRAPH>Later, Don Pedro and Claudio are with Leonato and Benedick, and they launch into teasing Benedick, who\u2019s really changed by his crush\u2014he has a shaved beard, he smells nice, and his wit is blunted\u2014he\u2019s already a milquetoast. Benedick can\u2019t handle the teasing, and scampers off, leaving Don Pedro and Claudio to be approached by Don John. Don John claims Hero is disloyal, and he can show them proof. Claudio says if he finds Hero is disloyal, he\u2019ll disgrace her in front of the whole congregation... which is a tad overly dramatic in our opinion.<PARAGRAPH>Later that night, Dogberry, a constable, and his man Verges give muddled instructions to an incompetent group of watchmen, who plan to sleep through their duties. In spite of their incompetence, they hear Borachio recount to Conrade (another of Don John\u2019s evil cronies) how Don John\u2019s scheme went off without a hitch. Margaret appeared to be Hero and flirted with Borachio, while Don Pedro, Claudio, and Don John witnessed \"Hero\u2019s\" disloyalty. Claudio has decided that he\u2019ll renounce Hero tomorrow morning at the chapel. The watch then comes forth and arrests Borachio and Conrade for their wickedness.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s the morning, and Hero is getting ready for her wedding. Beatrice is helping her, although Beatrice isn't acting like her usual jovial self. Margaret teases that Beatrice looks like she\u2019s in love. Just before the wedding can take place, Dogberry comes to Leonato, trying to get him to come to the examination of the captured prisoners, Borachio and Conrade. Leonato is in a rush to get to his daughter\u2019s wedding, so he tells Dogberry to do the examination himself.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, everyone\u2019s ready for the wedding, except Claudio, who proceeds to call Hero a disloyal, deceptive, and faithless whore in front of the entire group that\u2019s come to watch her get married. Hero denies Claudio\u2019s claims that she was flirting with another man at her window, but Don Pedro says he definitely saw her too, as did Don John. Hero faints. The men stalk out, leaving the girl for dead, and everyone else tries to sort out just what in the world is going on.<PARAGRAPH>Beatrice and the Friar are certain there\u2019s some treachery afoot, and Benedick realizes Don John must be at the bottom of this. The Friar then comes up with a strategy\u2014they\u2019ll let word get out that Hero actually did die. People will then pity the girl, and forget this bad little groomzilla episode. Claudio will once again remember Hero fondly (once she\u2019s dead) and in the meantime, some proof will probably surface that will clear her good name. If nothing shakes out, they can always send Hero off to a convent to be cloistered away.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone leaves except Benedick and Beatrice. Benedick takes advantage of this really awkward moment to profess his love for Beatrice. She\u2019s stoked, and says she loves him too, but she\u2019s pretty preoccupied with her cousin\u2019s ruin. However, if Benedick wants to prove his love to her, he should kill Claudio for slandering Hero. At first, Benedick tries to backtrack out of it, but Beatrice threatens to leave. Benedick comes around to thinking Claudio really has wronged Hero, and he goes off to challenge Claudio.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, back at the ranch (just kidding, the prison), Dogberry is interrogating Borachio and Conrade. He trips up the investigation, but the Sexton (the guy who\u2019s documenting the whole process) manages to piece together that they\u2019ve found the source of Hero\u2019s ills. The Sexton is off to report the news to Leonato, with the prisoners in tow. Leonato and Antonio confront Don Pedro and Claudio, saying they\u2019ve killed an innocent girl by wronging Hero.<PARAGRAPH>Claudio and Don Pedro, however, stick to their guns; they maintain they\u2019ve done nothing wrong, they only exposed Hero as a harlot\u2014it's not their fault that she's now a dead\u00a0harlot. Next, Don Pedro and Claudio then run into Benedick. Benedick challenges Claudio to a duel for causing the wrongful death of an innocent girl. He calls Claudio a young punk, saying he\u2019s waiting for the challenge whenever Claudio is ready.<PARAGRAPH>Claudio and Don Pedro joke about Benedick until Dogberry comes in with Borachio and Conrade in tow. Borachio admits that he and Don John are responsible for framing Hero, and now the innocent girl is dead. Claudio and Don Pedro are shocked. So Claudio and Don Pedro are sorry they killed a girl by calling her a harlot, and Leonato enters, having heard the same news. Claudio says he and Don Pedro are to blame as much as Borachio and Don John... because they believed the slander against Hero.<PARAGRAPH>Leonato says Claudio can make it up to him by going to Hero\u2019s grave and mourning her with an epitaph (a statement in memory of a deceased person), to be hung on the family tomb. That should clear Hero\u2019s name to the public. After that, Claudio is to meet Leonato at the house, and marry Antonio\u2019s daughter, who is apparently the spitting image of Hero.<PARAGRAPH>During this time, Benedick and Beatrice have been flirting around in the orchard. Beatrice hears that Benedick challenged Claudio and is waiting for an answer, and she won\u2019t make out with Benedick until he\u2019s got some blood on his hands. Thankfully, before anyone can get their hands into some flesh, Ursula rushes in to announce that Hero\u2019s name has been cleared.<PARAGRAPH>That night, Don Pedro and Claudio go to Hero\u2019s tomb, where they hang an epitaph and mourn. Claudio promises he\u2019ll do this ritual once a year on the anniversary of Hero's death. Thankfully, it\u2019s a new day, and they can get over all this sadness about Hero and get to Claudio\u2019s new wedding. At Leonato\u2019s house, everyone\u2019s stoked that things worked out so nicely. The newly exonerated Hero and all the girls are sent off to cover their faces, and Benedick pulls the Friar aside to ask for his services in marrying him to Beatrice after the whole \"Hero\u2019s risen from the dead\" hubbub.<PARAGRAPH>Don Pedro and Claudio enter. Claudio agrees to marry Leonato\u2019s niece before he\u2019s even seen her. Then, he sees her, and realizes she\u2019s actually Hero!<PARAGRAPH>As everyone is about to head off to the chapel, Benedick makes a big public show of calling out Beatrice, asking if she loves him, maybe. Beatrice, embarrassed, basically says \"Um, I love you in a friendly, non-sexual manner. Of course I don\u2019t want to marry you, because that would make me a hypocrite for saying all the time how stupid marriage is.\" Benedick says (totally paraphrased) \"Oh, friends are fun, I like having more friends.\"<PARAGRAPH>Then Claudio and Hero blow Beatrice and Benedick's cover by revealing love notes the two had written to each other, and Benedick and Beatrice say, \"Aw shucks, guess we\u2019ll have to get married after all... but it\u2019s only because we pity each other and don\u2019t want to die old and alone.\"<PARAGRAPH>Then Benedick declares he doesn\u2019t mind getting married after all, as people change their minds all the time about who they really are. \u00a0Benedick also\u00a0announces that he and Claudio are friends again, and everyone takes to dancing before they\u2019re even married.
