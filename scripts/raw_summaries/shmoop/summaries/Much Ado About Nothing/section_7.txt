{"name": "Act III, Scene ii", "summary": "In another part of Leonato\u2019s house, Prince Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, and Leonato are all gathered.<PARAGRAPH>Don Pedro says he\u2019s only sticking around until Claudio is married, and then he\u2019s off back to Arragon. Claudio volunteers to come with him, but Don Pedro points out that Claudio will have more interesting things to do on his wedding night.<PARAGRAPH>Instead of Claudio, Prince Don Pedro looks forward to Benedick\u2019s company. He then makes some heavy-handed references to the fact that Benedick can be trusted to never fall in love. This would seem like a random thing to say, except we know Don Pedro\u2019s trying to egg Benedick on.<PARAGRAPH>Benedick says, \"Actually, guys, I\u2019m going through some special chan-ges.\" And knowing what we know about special changes, they\u2019re a perfect invitation for mockery and derision.<PARAGRAPH>While Claudio and Don Pedro tease Benedick mercilessly for seeming lovesick, Leonato notes that he looks sadder.<PARAGRAPH>They offer all sorts of cures for his ache. Then they note that he\u2019s gotten a haircut, is wearing cologne, and his beard has been shaven off and the hairs sent to fill tennis balls. (Weird!) Anyway, with all these changes, it looks like Benedick is totally in love.<PARAGRAPH>They tease that his melancholy and newly subdued nature are sure signs of his sighs over a girl, and they figure that if any woman loves him, it\u2019s only because she doesn\u2019t know him very well.<PARAGRAPH>Then there\u2019s some taunting about how the girl Benedick loves will die for him, but she\u2019ll die with her face upward. (\"Die\" is Elizabethan slang for orgasm\u2014yet another cheap sex joke, courtesy of William Shakespeare).<PARAGRAPH>Benedick shrugs off all this teasing and asks Leonato to go off with him to talk about serious stuff.<PARAGRAPH>Don Pedro and Claudio are then conveniently left alone for Don John to prey upon.<PARAGRAPH>Don John confirms that Claudio means to get married the next day, and then he\u2019s like, \"Well maybe you won\u2019t want to get married tomorrow after you fall into my evil trap.\" But he doesn\u2019t say that because then it wouldn\u2019t be much of a trap, would it?<PARAGRAPH>Anyway, Don John builds the melodrama by saying they might hate him for what he has to say, but they should wait until after hearing his news to pass judgment on him. Don John claims that Don Pedro\u2019s efforts for Claudio\u2019s wedding were sadly misguided: Hero is disloyal. He says he could call her all sorts of other nasty names, but he doesn\u2019t.<PARAGRAPH>Instead, he\u2019ll let the seed of suspicion sprout in Don Pedro and Claudio until he can bring them to Hero\u2019s window at midnight. There, he promises them they\u2019ll see a man in Hero\u2019s bedroom. After that, if Claudio still wants to marry, he can, but at least he\u2019ll know what he\u2019s signing up for.<PARAGRAPH>Claudio pledges that if he sees anything unseemly tonight, he\u2019ll be sure to be as dramatic as possible, by denouncing Hero in front of the whole wedding party tomorrow. Because that's\u00a0adult.<PARAGRAPH>Don Pedro pitches in that he\u2019ll help Claudio disgrace Hero at the wedding if there\u2019s proof of her disloyalty tonight. After all, he\u2019s responsible for getting the two of them together in the first place.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210411203609/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/much-ado-about-nothing/summary/act-iii-scene-ii"}
