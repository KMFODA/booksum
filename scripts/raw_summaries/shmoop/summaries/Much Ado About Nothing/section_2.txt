{"name": "Act I, Scene iii", "summary": "Don John (Don Pedro\u2019s illegitimate brother) meets with Conrade (his attendant).<PARAGRAPH>Don John is being a his usual negative self, and Conrade tries to placate him with platitudes. (How\u2019s that for vocab enrichment!)<PARAGRAPH>Don John wonders how Conrade can be a regular Charlie of the Chipper Brigade when he\u2019s supposed to be born under Saturn (which was thought to be the planet farthest from the sun, and thus the coldest and grumpiest planet to be born under). Don John doesn\u2019t bother with silver linings; when he\u2019s cranky, he\u2019s not going to hide it.<PARAGRAPH>Don John says he eats only when he\u2019s hungry, sleeps only when he\u2019s drowsy, and isn\u2019t going dance like he\u2019s some clown when he\u2019s not feeling like a dancing clown.<PARAGRAPH>Conrade\u2019s pretty serious though, and says Don John has to get his attitude in check, because he\u2019s still treading on delicate ground. Don John only recently reconciled with his brother, Don Pedro, but the reconciliation is worthless if Don John can\u2019t get it together and stop acting like a villain.<PARAGRAPH>Like any good villain, Don John points out that he acts like a villain because he is a villain, and he doesn\u2019t care whether he\u2019s hated. Then he strokes his standard villain-issued white cat. (Not really.)<PARAGRAPH>Don John notes that while he seems to be in the good graces of his brother, he\u2019s actually more like a muzzled dog tied to a block than a trusted guy.<PARAGRAPH>Don John doesn\u2019t deny, though, that his brother\u2019s precautions are reasonable ones, as he would like to do some mischief as soon as he gets the chance. (Plotline of the play = Don John\u2019s chance to do mischief.)<PARAGRAPH>In the meantime, Don John isn\u2019t going to join the \"Vote For Don Pedro\" squad, no matter how much people try to convince him it\u2019s a good idea.<PARAGRAPH>Borachio enters and delivers to Don John news of an impending marriage.<PARAGRAPH>Borachio was perfuming a smelly room by burning some incense when he heard Claudio and Don Pedro approach, deep in conversation.<PARAGRAPH>Borachio got the gist of the conversation correctly (unlike Antonio\u2019s man) about Don Pedro\u2019s plan to court Hero on Claudio\u2019s behalf. This is kind of a Tarantino approach to the wooing of Hero, which we now see is the focus of approximately eight million schemes from her dad, Don John, and of course Claudio and Don Pedro.<PARAGRAPH>Don John is elated to hear news of this little plan between Don Pedro and Claudio, especially as he blames Claudio for playing a large part in overthrowing him in a vaguely-mentioned rebellion. (Some scholars think this alludes to the battle that took place before the play\u2019s first scene, which may have been a contest between Don Pedro and Don John for power.)<PARAGRAPH>The men exit, plotting their mischief, though we think Shakespeare may be gearing up with a lot of sardoodledom (that's a fun theater word for melodrama).", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210411203609/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/much-ado-about-nothing/summary/act-i-scene-iii"}
