{"name": "Act II, Scene ii", "summary": "Don John and Borachio are freshly sulky over the news of Hero\u2019s wedding to Claudio. Borachio says he\u2019s figured out a simple and fool-proof way to ruin the marriage, which would make Don John really happy.<PARAGRAPH>Borachio reminds Don John of Hero\u2019s attendant, Margaret, who he\u2019s apparently been messing around with for some time.<PARAGRAPH>Borachio talks vaguely of a plan to have Margaret stand in Hero\u2019s window. Don John, however, is slightly confused about how exactly this is a foolproof plan to ruin weddings and lives.<PARAGRAPH>Borachio\u2019s got it all planned out: all Don John has to do is go to Don Pedro and announce that he\u2019s discovered Hero is actually in love with Borachio. He\u2019ll need to pretend to be apologetic that Claudio\u2019s future marriage is ruined, as is Don Pedro\u2019s reputation as a matchmaker and an honorable man. Don John can insist he\u2019s only telling Don Pedro out of love.<PARAGRAPH>Surely, Don Pedro will require proof of this slander, and that\u2019s where big deception comes in.<PARAGRAPH>The night before the wedding, Don John should bring Don Pedro and Claudio to Hero\u2019s window. Borachio will have contrived to make Hero absent, and Margaret will stand in silhouette by the Hero\u2019s window, appearing to be Hero. There, Borachio himself will be making love to Margaret (bow chicka bow bow) while calling her \"Hero.\" The men will witness this, and it will seem like solid visual proof that Hero is cheating on Claudio. That should be enough to ruin the wedding.<PARAGRAPH>Don John promises Borachio a thousand ducats in payment for this scheming, and the two men part to set their plan in action.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210411203609/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/much-ado-about-nothing/summary/act-ii-scene-ii"}
