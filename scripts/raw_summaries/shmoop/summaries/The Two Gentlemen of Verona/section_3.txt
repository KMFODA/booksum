{"name": "Act 2, Scene 1", "summary": "Back in Milan, Speed helps Valentine put on his gloves and finds a third glove that belongs to Silvia\u2014the girl with whom Valentine has recently fallen head over heels in love.<PARAGRAPH>Speed teases Valentine about his crush and says that Valentine's been moping around like a lovesick puppy: sighing, folding his arms, singing love songs, refusing to eat, and crying like a girl weeping over her dead grandmother (he seriously says that).<PARAGRAPH>Then Speed proceeds to insult Valentine and Silvia by implying that Silvia is ugly but Valentine thinks she's beautiful because he's wearing love goggles.<PARAGRAPH>Valentine says that regardless of what Speed says or thinks, he likes Sylvia. Although last night she asked him to write a love letter to someone for her.<PARAGRAPH>Speed asks if he did it, and Valentine says he did the best he could.<PARAGRAPH>Silvia enters and lovelorn Valentine proceeds to shower her with compliments. She returns the affection, which Speed notices, though it seems to go over Valentine's head.<PARAGRAPH>Valentine says he wrote the love letter for her, but he didn't like writing to someone he doesn't know on her behalf. In fact, he wouldn't have done it, but because she asked, he couldn't say no.<PARAGRAPH>Silvia reads the letter and is disappointed with how unemotional it is. Valentine, the goofball, didn't get that she was flirting and asking him to write the letter to himself. From her. With lots of gooey love.<PARAGRAPH>She shoves the letter back at Valentine, telling him to try again\u2014this time, the letter should be more passionate.<PARAGRAPH>When he's done writing, he should read it over and make sure it pleases him. Valentine still doesn't get it. Why should the letter please him when it's being written for some anonymous bloke?<PARAGRAPH>Poor Valentine continues to be baffled by Sylvia's behavior until Speed explains why Sylvia is so upset.<PARAGRAPH>He says that Valentine has written to Sylvia, sure, but she may not be able to write back\u2014either because she doesn't have time, because she's too modest, or because she's worried that a messenger would read her letter and her reputation would be ruined. So...she's been very clever in getting Valentine to write to himself (except that Valentine has been a bit slow to pick up on her strategy).<PARAGRAPH>Speed announces it's dinner time, but Valentine isn't hungry. He's full of love. Speed says that's great, buddy, but I need real food. So they go.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219163530/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/gentlemen-of-verona/summary/act-2-scene-1"}
