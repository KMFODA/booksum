(By \"kids,\" we mean \"sons,\" because noblemen didn't let their daughters go globetrotting.)<PARAGRAPH>Antonio thinks that his brother is right\u2014if Proteus doesn't explore the world now while he's young, he'll regret it when he's an old man. Plus, a young man's education isn't complete without a little travel.<PARAGRAPH>After some deliberation, Antonio and Panthino decide Proteus should be sent to the Emperor's court, where he'll get to hang out at jousts and learn how to schmooze with all the other noblemen's kids.<PARAGRAPH>(OK. We're just going to say this now to avoid any confusion about the plot later on. Even though Antonio says he's going to send Proteus to the Emperor's court, Proteus ends up at the Duke's court. Again, we forgive Big Willy for the minor inconsistency.)<PARAGRAPH>It just so happens that a group of friends are travelling to the \"Emperor's\" court tomorrow so Proteus can tag along.<PARAGRAPH>Then Proteus enters the room but he doesn't see his dad and Panthino.
