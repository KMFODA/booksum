He was just testing Vittoria's loyalty. He now says he'll live to punish her for betraying him and warns men against wives who will betray them in the same kind of way, taking lovers as soon as they've died.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, Lodovico and Gasparo bust in, announcing that they're there to avenge Isabella.
