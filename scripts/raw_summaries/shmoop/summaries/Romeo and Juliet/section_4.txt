{"name": "Act 1, Scene 4", "summary": "Romeo and his posse (i.e., Benvolio and Mercutio) are getting ready to sneak into the Capulets' party. Luckily, it's a costume party, so they can wear masks.<PARAGRAPH>[We should point out that Mercutio's name was on the invite list, because he's not a Montague, but he feels the need to wear a mask anyway. What's up with that?]<PARAGRAPH>Romeo and Mercutio trade insults and there's some naughty talk about love, in particular, what to do to when \"love pricks [hurts] like a thorn.\" Mercutio's solution? \"If love be rough with you, be rough with love. Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\"<PARAGRAPH>Translation: The solution to heartache is to go out and have sex.<PARAGRAPH>Romeo continues to boo-hoo about the unavailable Rosaline and then he announces that he had a dream the night before. Before he can go into the details, Mercutio interrupts and delivers a long, crazy speech about \"Queen Mab,\" a tiny fairy who visits people in their dreams. (You can read more about it in \"Symbols.\")<PARAGRAPH>Romeo says Mercutio is talking nonsense and Mercutio, our resident skeptic, retorts that dreams are for idiots.<PARAGRAPH>Before entering the party, Romeo says he has a feeling that \"fate\" may have something bad in store for him.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210514145017/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/romeo-and-juliet/summary/act-1-scene-4"}
