{"name": "Act 1, Scene 3", "summary": "At the Capulet house, Juliet's mother, Lady Capulet, comes in to tell her daughter about Paris's proposal.<PARAGRAPH>But Juliet's nurse (who just gets called \"Nurse\" through the whole thing) first delivers a long, semi-bawdy speech about Juliet's infancy and toddler years.<PARAGRAPH>Her rambling, tangent of a speech reveals the following information: the Nurse had a baby named Susan who was about Juliet's age but, sadly, she died. The Nurse is not only Juliet's nanny but she also her wet-nurse. When it was time to \"wean\" (stop breastfeeding) Juliet, the Nurse put \"wormwood\" on her breast. (Wormwood is a disgustingly bitter plant extract.)<PARAGRAPH>Also, Juliet once fell down and cut her forehead when she was little, which the Nurse's late husband thought was hilarious\u2014so hilarious that he turned the accident into a dirty joke about how Juliet would eventually grow up and then fall down (on her back) and have sex with a guy.<PARAGRAPH>This is \u2026 a lot of information. Lady Capulet eventually cuts her off and tells her to \"hold her peace.\"<PARAGRAPH>Lady Capulet unloads the news that Paris has been sniffing around for Juliet's hand in marriage.<PARAGRAPH>Eyeroll.<PARAGRAPH>Just check Paris out at the party that night, Lady Capulet says. He'll be the oh-so-dreamy guy all the other girls are swooning over.<PARAGRAPH>Speaking of, Peter, the servant, enters to announce that guests are beginning to arrive for the big bash.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210514145017/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/romeo-and-juliet/summary/act-1-scene-3"}
