{"name": "Prologue", "summary": "The Chorus (kind of like a narrator) appears on stage and gives us the lowdown on the play we're about to watch (or read).<PARAGRAPH>The setting is \"fair Verona,\" a town in Italy where two rival upper-crust families (the Capulets and the Montagues) have been feuding for as long as anyone can remember.<PARAGRAPH>We're also told how the children of these two families (that would be Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet) will fall in love, but the story's not going to be a happy one. Before the play is over, our infamous \"star-crossed lovers [will] take their life\" (commit suicide), which will put an end to their parents' feud.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, the Chorus invites us to sit back and relax while we enjoy the \"two-hours' traffic of [the] stage,\" which is sixteenth-century theater speak for \"the next two hours it's going to take for the play to be performed.\"<PARAGRAPH>Brain Snack: In director Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film adaptation of the play (Romeo + Juliet), the Chorus is replaced by a TV anchorwoman who delivers the lines as an evening news story.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210514145017/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/romeo-and-juliet/summary/prologue"}
