Like:<PARAGRAPH>The waiters won't give her tea when she's eating with Mrs. Bruce.<PARAGRAPH>She's not allowed to sit in a chair and hold the child on her lap, but has to place the child in the chair and stand behind her.<PARAGRAPH>The servants won't bring her dinner to her room when Mrs. Bruce asks them to, so she has to go down to the kitchen to get it herself.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Linda puts her foot down and says that Mrs. Bruce is paying for her just like any of the white servants, so she'd better be treated like one of them.<PARAGRAPH>This actually works.<PARAGRAPH>See, Linda says, you've just got to stand up for your rights.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210509234912/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/incidents-life-slave-girl/summary/chapter-35"}
