{"name": "Chapter Seven", "summary": "Harriet receives a love letter from our farmer-friend, Mr. Martin.<PARAGRAPH>Emma, of course, is outraged on her friend\u2019s behalf. How could Mr. Martin dream of lowering Harriet to his social station?<PARAGRAPH>Unable to decide how to respond to the letter, Harriet turns to Emma for advice.<PARAGRAPH>After reading Mr. Martin\u2019s letter, Emma is secretly troubled \u2013 it sure doesn\u2019t sound like a farmer\u2019s letter. It\u2019s too well-written.<PARAGRAPH>Emma wonders if Mr. Martin is actually more of a gentleman than she\u2019d thought.<PARAGRAPH>She decides to ignore her better instincts, however. After all, a farmer is a farmer \u2013 at the end of the day, he still smells like the cows.<PARAGRAPH>Emma refuses to sway Harriet\u2019s decision (although she\u2019s secretly determined to stop Harriet from making the biggest mistake of her life).<PARAGRAPH>Hilarity ensues.<PARAGRAPH>Harriet wants to like Mr. Martin\u2019s letter.<PARAGRAPH>Emma doesn\u2019t say anything.<PARAGRAPH>Harriet thinks Mr. Martin\u2019s letter might be too short. That\u2019s how you judge the quality of a letter, right?<PARAGRAPH>Emma secretly cringes at Harriet\u2019s standards, but she senses that Harriet might be moving in the right direction.<PARAGRAPH>Wait \u2013 didn\u2019t we say that Emma wasn\u2019t going to push Harriet into anything? Well, yes.<PARAGRAPH>But we weren\u2019t quite telling the truth. That\u2019s because Emma wasn\u2019t quite truthful with herself.<PARAGRAPH>Emma doesn\u2019t quite push Harriet into rejecting Mr. Martin. (OK, that\u2019s not quite true. But let\u2019s go with it for now.)<PARAGRAPH>Although she seems faintly troubled at the thought of hurting Mr. Martin, Harriet decides she\u2019d far rather refuse him than disagree with her friend.<PARAGRAPH>After the letter is written, Emma pats Harriet on the head (not literally, but you get the picture).<PARAGRAPH>Recognizing that Harriet seems glum, Emma attempts to cheer her up by talking about the fabulous Mr. Elton.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s convinced that Mr. Elton has taken Harriet\u2019s portrait in order to show it to his family \u2013 and she soon convinces Harriet, as well.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-seven"}
