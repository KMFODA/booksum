{"name": "Chapter Eighteen", "summary": "Moving on\u2026<PARAGRAPH>Frank Churchill still hasn\u2019t shown up in Highbury.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, this means that Emma can fantasize about him some more.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, the more she thinks about Frank, the more she becomes convinced that he\u2019s perfect for her.<PARAGRAPH>They share the same friends, they have the same interests (at least, that\u2019s what she\u2019s heard).<PARAGRAPH>Of course, she\u2019s never met the guy.<PARAGRAPH>But hey, how important is reality?<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Weston (the eternal optimist) is sure that Frank will come soon.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Weston, however, begins to have her doubts about Frank \u2013 which she shares with Emma.<PARAGRAPH>Emma and Mr. Knightley get into a spat about Frank\u2019s excuses for not coming to visit.<PARAGRAPH>Emma plays devil\u2019s advocate: even though she secretly believes that Frank must be spineless, she argues that his dependence on his aunt and desire to keep her happy make it impossible for him to disobey her.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley, indignant at the disrespect Frank is showing to his father and step-mother by not coming, argues that Frank is a spineless wimp.<PARAGRAPH>We find out (surprise, surprise) that Frank also likes drinking and the ladies. (This doesn\u2019t shock Emma at all. Everybody likes a bad man\u2026.)<PARAGRAPH>As the argument continues, Emma says some pretty smart things. Too bad she doesn\u2019t actually believe them.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley gets all worked up and storms off.<PARAGRAPH>Realizing that this is the first time that she doesn\u2019t respect Mr. Knightley\u2019s opinion, Emma decides that maybe she believes her own arguments, after all.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s amazing what you can talk yourself into!", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-eighteen"}
