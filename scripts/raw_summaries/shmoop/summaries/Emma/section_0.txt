{"name": "Chapter One", "summary": "Let\u2019s start off by establishing some facts: at almost twenty-one years old, Emma Woodhouse is pretty perfect. She\u2019s pretty, rich, and the most popular girl in town. (Not bad, huh?)<PARAGRAPH>Emma lives with her father in the largest house in town. Noticing a pattern here?<PARAGRAPH>We meet Emma in her home (Hartfield) thinking about the recent marriage of her governess, Mrs. Weston.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s lonely without her, sure, but at least Emma has the comfort of knowing that she arranged her friend\u2019s marriage. We could think of Emma as Mother Teresa and Cupid all rolled into one \u2013 if only because that\u2019s how she thinks of herself.<PARAGRAPH>Emma\u2019s father, Mr. Woodhouse, isn\u2019t nearly as happy about the new arrangement.<PARAGRAPH>In his mind, marriage is a terrible institution \u2013 mostly because it means that people no longer revolve around his will. (Get used to his complaining. We\u2019ll return to it again and again. And again.)<PARAGRAPH>As Emma consoles her father (and congratulates herself), their neighbor Mr. Knightley enters.<PARAGRAPH>Knightley\u2019s an old friend, and his brother has married Emma\u2019s sister (and if you think that this sounds incestuous, just wait! It only gets better\u2026).<PARAGRAPH>Knightley bursts Emma\u2019s match-making bubble by suggesting that Mrs. Weston might have found her husband by herself \u2013 without Emma\u2019s help.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily for our story, Emma isn\u2019t easily convinced.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-one"}
