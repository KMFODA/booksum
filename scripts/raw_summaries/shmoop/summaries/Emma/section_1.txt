{"name": "Chapter Two", "summary": "We meet Mr. Weston, the former colonel who just stole Mrs. Weston from the Woodhouses (if you ask Emma\u2019s father, that is).<PARAGRAPH>Weston\u2019s an all-around good guy \u2013 a great soldier, a gentleman, and a property owner. Let us emphasize that again: he\u2019s a good guy. Got it?<PARAGRAPH>As if that weren\u2019t enough, we also meet (or at least hear of) Mr. Weston\u2019s son, Frank Churchill. Why isn\u2019t he Frank Weston? That\u2019s a good question. More on that later\u2026.<PARAGRAPH>Frank\u2019s the son of Mr. Weston\u2019s first marriage. Frank\u2019s been raised by a wealthy aunt, which means that Mr. Weston rarely sees him.<PARAGRAPH>Rumor has it that Frank might be returning to pay a wedding visit, however, which has the whole town a-flutter.<PARAGRAPH>Our narrator takes us back to the scene of the wedding, where Mr. Woodhouse is desperately trying to convince the entire wedding party that cake is bad for the health.<PARAGRAPH>He enlists the expert opinion of his doctor, Mr. Perry. (We recommend checking out this scene \u2013 it\u2019s a guaranteed chuckle.)", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-two"}
