{"name": "Chapter Forty-Three", "summary": "The next day, the exact same crew of people head up to Box Hill.<PARAGRAPH>You could think of this party as a nightmare version of day 1 (we sure do).<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s hot, nobody seems very excited about anything, and conversation sort of sucks.<PARAGRAPH>They all sit down on a hill, and Emma decides to liven things up a bit.<PARAGRAPH>She and Frank start flirting outrageously with each other. Sure, she knows that everybody else is listening \u2013 and that it\u2019s ridiculously inappropriate \u2013 but she\u2019s in a strangely elated mood.<PARAGRAPH>Frank, too, seems strangely driven to wild moods.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s overly bright and far, far too attentive to Emma.<PARAGRAPH>He asks everyone to share what they\u2019re thinking with Emma.<PARAGRAPH>No one takes them up on the offer.<PARAGRAPH>The two propose a game: each of the party will say one very witty thing \u2013 or two sort of witty things \u2013 or three boring things. Emma will judge who wins.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Bates laughs and observes that she won\u2019t have to worry, then \u2013 at the very least, she can come up with three dull things.<PARAGRAPH>Emma, high on her own energy, replies that Miss Bates\u2019 problem will be limiting herself to only three boring things.<PARAGRAPH>There\u2019s a dreadful pause.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Bates slowly figures out what Emma meant.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s very humble, so she just turns to Mr. Knightley and says that she must have been really boring for Emma to have said something so awful to an old friend.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Weston comes up with a clever pun on Emma\u2019s name. The company laughs.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley declares that if this is to be the focus of the game, he won\u2019t participate.<PARAGRAPH>In other words, he\u2019s not too fond of an Emma love-fest.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Elton throws a hissy-fit. For obvious reasons.<PARAGRAPH>By and large, the party disintegrates unhappily.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. and Mrs. Elton walk off. As they do, Frank makes a sarcastic remark about the \"happy couple.\"<PARAGRAPH>Jane gravely replies that a couple that meets too quickly often finds later that they\u2019re not compatible.<PARAGRAPH>Frank, more excited than ever, asks Emma to promise to select his wife.<PARAGRAPH>That way, she\u2019ll be perfect. Like Emma. Aww\u2026.<PARAGRAPH>He declares that he\u2019s leaving for Europe for a few years.<PARAGRAPH>When he returns, he wants his wife to be waiting for him!<PARAGRAPH>Emma laughs and agrees to find him a woman.<PARAGRAPH>As they\u2019re about to leave, Mr. Knightley pulls Emma aside.<PARAGRAPH>He chastises her for speaking so cruelly to Miss Bates.<PARAGRAPH>Although Emma is immediately ashamed and sorry, she pretends not to understand him.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley explains why he\u2019s so upset: Miss Bates is poor, and she\u2019s seen her station in society sink as her money has dwindled.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s only ever been kind to Emma.<PARAGRAPH>Being mean to Miss Bates, in other words, is sort of like kicking a hurt puppy \u2013 only the most uncaring person would ever think of it.<PARAGRAPH>Deeply ashamed, Emma turns her face away \u2013 and so she misses the chance to tell Mr. Knightley how sorry she truly is.<PARAGRAPH>The carriages roll away.<PARAGRAPH>Emma cries all the way home.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-forty-three"}
