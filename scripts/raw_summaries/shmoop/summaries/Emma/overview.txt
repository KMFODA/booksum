{"name": "Overview", "summary": "Emma Woodhouse has the world at her fingertips. She\u2019s young, pretty, and smart; she also happens to be the reigning queen of her village\u2019s social scene. Emma lives in Highbury, a small town about sixteen miles outside of London, with her aging father. Mr. Woodhouse loves Emma, but he\u2019s utterly unable to offer her any guidance \u2013 which is perhaps why Emma doesn\u2019t seem to have any sense of her own limitations. Life seems pretty sweet \u2013 if a bit boring \u2013 and so Emma decides to spice things up by taking on a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Harriet Smith. Even though Emma\u2019s determined never to marry herself, she immediately decides to find Harriet a husband.Determined to make Harriet into a gentlewoman, Emma sets out to refine Harriet\u2019s tastes \u2013 especially in men. She convinces Harriet to dump Robert Martin, the young farmer who likes her, and set her sights on the town\u2019s clergyman, Mr. Elton. Unfortunately, Mr. Elton turns out to be in love with Emma \u2013 or at least with Emma\u2019s money. After the Mr. Elton debacle, Emma thinks that she\u2019s learned her lessons in matchmaking. Luckily for us (if not for Harriet), she hasn\u2019t.When the dashing Frank Churchill comes to town, Emma tries very hard to fall in love with him herself. She can\u2019t seem to fall head over heels for him, but she does manage to make a good deal of mischief by flirting with him in front of Jane Fairfax, a young woman who recently returned to Highbury to live with her aunts. Meanwhile, Emma decides that Frank might just be the perfect new man for Harriet.Emma\u2019s exploits are watched \u2013 and commented upon \u2013 by her good friend, Mr. Knightley. Although Emma frequently ignores his advice, she cherishes his good opinion. When Mr. Knightley accuses her of belittling her poor neighbors, Emma begins to reflect upon her mistakes and even starts to change her ways.Unfortunately, Harriet confesses that she loves Mr. Knightley, not Frank. All of a sudden, Emma\u2019s plans crumble. She realizes that she loves Mr. Knightley too. Convinced that Mr. Knightley might be interested in Harriet, despite the fact that he practically lives with the Woodhouses, Emma crushes Mr. Knightley\u2019s attempts to propose to her. Eventually all romantic muddles are cleared: Emma marries Mr. Knightley, and Harriet marries her farmer, Robert Martin.Emma\u2019s story is surrounded by side-narratives of life in Highbury, including the romance of Frank and Jane Fairfax, the marriage of Emma\u2019s former governess, Mrs. Weston, and the escapades of the social climbers, Mr. and Mrs. Elton.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201127211107/https:/www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary"}
