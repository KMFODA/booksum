{"name": "Chapter Twenty-Six", "summary": "Frank returns from London with a spiffy new haircut.<PARAGRAPH>Emma spends some time thinking about the relative virtues of Frank and Mr. Knightley.<PARAGRAPH>There\u2019s no way that Mr. Knightley would ever do anything as silly as traveling to get his hair cut.<PARAGRAPH>Even if Mr. Knightley did do something silly, he\u2019d do it better.<PARAGRAPH>And he\u2019d know that it was silly. Frank can\u2019t seem to tell the difference between normal and completely ridiculous.<PARAGRAPH>OK, so Frank\u2019s a diva. But he\u2019s still loveable\u2026right?<PARAGRAPH>The night of the Coles\u2019 party arrives.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Bates comes to Hartfield to spend time with Emma\u2019s father.<PARAGRAPH>The big news at the party is that someone has given Jane Fairfax a piano. An anonymous someone.<PARAGRAPH>Emma promptly imagines an entire romance between Jane and Mr. Dixon (her friend\u2019s husband). She tells Frank all about it. He\u2019s highly amused.<PARAGRAPH>The two whisper together all through the night.<PARAGRAPH>Other than that, the party is pretty much your everyday trivial social scene. Emma enjoys herself more than she thought she would.<PARAGRAPH>Strangely, Frank keeps staring at Jane. When Emma calls him on it, he makes some snide remarks about Jane\u2019s hair.<PARAGRAPH>He even leaves Emma for a bit to say hello to Jane.<PARAGRAPH>Emma wants to see what he says, but Frank\u2019s body blocks the way.<PARAGRAPH>After dinner, Mrs. Cole asks Emma and Jane to play on the piano.<PARAGRAPH>Emma\u2019s OK at playing the piano \u2013 but at least she\u2019s learned to work what she\u2019s got. She plays a few simple songs.<PARAGRAPH>Surprisingly, Frank Churchill joins in singing. Emma\u2019s secretly thrilled.<PARAGRAPH>After Emma plays, Jane plays. Perfectly. Of course.<PARAGRAPH>Frank asks Jane to play again. And again.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley gets angry: Jane has a cold. She shouldn\u2019t be straining to play so much.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley convinces Miss Bates to tell Jane to stop.<PARAGRAPH>Emma listens with Mrs. Weston, who has a new theory: she thinks Mr. Knightley is in love with Jane.<PARAGRAPH>After all, who wouldn\u2019t be?<PARAGRAPH>Emma\u2019s strangely put out by this thought.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Weston\u2019s hunch seems to be supported by the fact that Mr. Knightley seems very protective of Jane that evening.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-twenty-six"}
