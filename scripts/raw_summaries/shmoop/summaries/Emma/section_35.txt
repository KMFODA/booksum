{"name": "Chapter Thirty-Six", "summary": "Mr. Weston thinks that it\u2019s only polite to tell Mrs. Elton how pleased he will be to introduce her to Frank.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Elton immediately assumes that Mr. Weston is paying her a special compliment. (Probably because she\u2019s the most important woman she knows.)<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Weston declares that Frank\u2019s aunt is a \"fine lady.\"<PARAGRAPH>Not willing to be outdone, Mrs. Elton asserts that her sister is also a fine lady.<PARAGRAPH>It becomes clear that Mr. Weston didn\u2019t mean his comment to be a compliment.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Elton\u2019s in a pickle: she wants Mr. Weston to admire her sister, but she doesn\u2019t want her to be the same sort of fine lady as Mrs. Churchill.<PARAGRAPH>She does some fancy back-pedaling.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, Mr. Weston\u2019s attention span isn\u2019t too good. He\u2019s forgotten all about their conversation within seconds.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton begin to have a battle of the tongues:<PARAGRAPH>He talks for awhile about Frank and the Churchills.<PARAGRAPH>She replies by talking for awhile about her sister and Maple Grove.<PARAGRAPH>He responds with an answer about Frank. She talks about her sister. It\u2019s almost like two monologues going on side-by-side.<PARAGRAPH>Emma sends for tea. Several members of the party play cards.<PARAGRAPH>Emma is left to talk to her brother-in-law, Mr. John Knightley.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. John Knightley usually hates dinner parties. Also, he\u2019s a bit of a bear to begin with. Emma\u2019s actually delighted to find that he seems to be in a fairly good mood!<PARAGRAPH>Mr. John Knightley mentions that his two boys (who will be spending the next few weeks with their aunt Emma) can be a bit rowdy.<PARAGRAPH>He offers to take them back whenever they begin to cause trouble.<PARAGRAPH>Observing that Emma seems to have a much more active social calendar than she used to, he smilingly asks her if she\u2019ll have any time at all for the boys.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley interrupts to say that the boys can come over to his house whenever Emma wishes.<PARAGRAPH>Indignant, Emma refuses to give up any time with her beloved nephews. (It seems that Emma, for all her faults, loves her family very, very much).<PARAGRAPH>The Knightley brothers chuckle over Emma\u2019s ruffled feathers.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-thirty-six"}
