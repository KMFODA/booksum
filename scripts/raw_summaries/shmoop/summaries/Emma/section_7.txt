{"name": "Chapter Eight", "summary": "Harriet basically moves into Hartfield.<PARAGRAPH>She even gets her own bedroom in Hartfield, for the days when she doesn\u2019t manage to make it back to her school.<PARAGRAPH>In case we haven\u2019t mentioned it, education doesn\u2019t seem to be Harriet\u2019s biggest priority.<PARAGRAPH>You probably figured that out on your own, huh?<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley comes to Hartfield when Harriet is out, excited to tell Emma that a handsome, responsible, upstanding man is interested in Harriet.<PARAGRAPH>(Any guesses who it might be?) Yup \u2013 Mr. Martin.<PARAGRAPH>Emma loves a good laugh \u2013 especially at Mr. Knightley\u2019s expense.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s delighted to tell him that Mr. Martin has already proposed to Harriet and been rejected like the dirty farmer that he is.<PARAGRAPH>Outraged at Harriet\u2019s stupidity, Mr. Knightley argues with Emma. A huge spat ensues.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley points out that Mr. Martin may be a nobody, but Harriet is a Nobody (capital N). She\u2019s got no fortune, no father, and no future. (Not to mention the fact that she\u2019s \u2013 well \u2013 not the brightest crayon in the box.)<PARAGRAPH>Emma gets some great points in about women\u2019s roles in marriage, but she can\u2019t help feeling crummy about Knightley\u2019s disapproval. Conscience, anyone?<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley scoffs when Emma says that Harriet is setting her sights on Mr. Elton.<PARAGRAPH>As Knightley notes, Elton is too much of a money-grubber to ever marry a Nobody.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley storms off, leaving a very uneasy Emma alone.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, Harriet soon arrives with fourth-hand news of Mr. Elton.
