{"name": "Chapter Forty-One", "summary": "As the summer wears on, Mr. Knightley becomes convinced that Frank\u2019s relationship with Jane Fairfax (or at least to Jane Fairfax) is more than meets the eye.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s caught Frank staring at Jane at weird moments. Often.<PARAGRAPH>Worried that Frank\u2019s attention to Jane might hurt Emma, Mr. Knightley treks over to Hartfield.<PARAGRAPH>He doesn\u2019t really want to share his suspicions with Emma, but his honor won\u2019t permit him to keep silent.<PARAGRAPH>They sure don\u2019t make men like they used to! Or could he have another motive?<PARAGRAPH>Frank passes a few days at the Westons\u2019.<PARAGRAPH>The Westons, Frank, Jane and the Bateses gather at Hartfield.<PARAGRAPH>Frank asks Mrs. Weston whether the doctor has ordered his new carriage yet.<PARAGRAPH>Surprised, Mrs. Weston confesses that she knows nothing about a new carriage.<PARAGRAPH>Frank blushes and seems confused. He was sure that he read about a carriage in a letter from Mrs. Weston\u2026but perhaps he made it up.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Weston laughs at what seems to be a good joke \u2013 the doctor is indeed getting a new carriage. In fact, Weston learned of it when he was visiting the Bateses.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley immediately glances at Jane, who is blushing deeply.<PARAGRAPH>Before he can deduce anything further, Emma calls them all in to tea.<PARAGRAPH>After tea, Emma pulls out a set of alphabet cards which she made for her nephews.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s raining, and there\u2019s not much else to do, so the group starts to make word scrambles for each other.<PARAGRAPH>Frank makes a scramble for Jane, who pushes it away rapidly.<PARAGRAPH>Don\u2019t worry \u2013 we can always count on Harriet to create an awkward situation!<PARAGRAPH>She picks up the word and asks Mr. Knightley to help her with it.<PARAGRAPH>The word is \"blunder.\" That\u2019s another word for a mistake.<PARAGRAPH>Does anyone else sense that there\u2019s more going on than meets the eye?<PARAGRAPH>Frank, already on to new mischief, creates a word for Emma. It\u2019s \"Dixon.\"<PARAGRAPH>Jane sees it and turns angrily away.<PARAGRAPH>Calling to her aunt, she gathers up her things to leave.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley stops to investigate the cause of her sudden departure. (Let\u2019s just call him Sherlock Holmes for this chapter, shall we?)<PARAGRAPH>He asks Emma to show him the words Frank made. Embarrassed, she says that it\u2019s just a private joke.<PARAGRAPH>This worries Knightley even more. (Remember the beginning of the chapter?)<PARAGRAPH>He awkwardly tries to gauge how much in love with Frank Emma is by asking her if she\u2019s noticed an attachment between Frank and Jane.<PARAGRAPH>Laughing at Mr. Knightley\u2019s ignorance, Emma assures him that there\u2019s absolutely nothing between Frank and Jane.<PARAGRAPH>At least, she\u2019s positive that Frank doesn\u2019t care for Jane.<PARAGRAPH>Uneasy, Mr. Knightley leaves.
