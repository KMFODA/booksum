Somehow all the gossips know all her dirty little secrets, even though she hasn\u2019t yet set foot in Highbury.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Augusta Hawkins has \u00a310,000 to her name (let\u2019s keep this in perspective here, folks \u2013 Emma\u2019s got \u00a320,000, so we could say that Mr. Elton is settling).<PARAGRAPH>Hearing about Miss Hawkins, Emma decides that she\u2019s really no better than Harriet in anything but her pocketbook.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Hawkins is not from a good family \u2013 in fact, her only claim to fame is a newly-rich brother-in-law. (Insert universal shudder here at the thought of the nouveau riche).<PARAGRAPH>Now that Mr. Elton is back in town, Harriet starts mourning his marriage.<PARAGRAPH>OK, OK, she\u2019s a bit sappy \u2013 but she\u2019s got a broken heart. Give her a break!<PARAGRAPH>Emma decides that perhaps Harriet should accept an invitation from the Martins to visit them.
