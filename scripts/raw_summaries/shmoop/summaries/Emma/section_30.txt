{"name": "Chapter Thirty-One", "summary": "In which Emma thinks a lot about love:<PARAGRAPH>OK, so Emma\u2019s decided that she\u2019s in love. Who wouldn\u2019t be?<PARAGRAPH>Frank is obviously meant for her.<PARAGRAPH>And he\u2019s cute.<PARAGRAPH>And he will be rich, if the old aunt will ever get around to dying.<PARAGRAPH>Why, then, isn\u2019t she more excited? There are no butterflies in her stomach.<PARAGRAPH>After considering her state for a few days, Emma decides that she\u2019s just the right amount in love \u2013 she\u2019s not crazy about Frank, but, well, a girl\u2019s only got so many options! And she did imagine once that he would be perfect\u2026<PARAGRAPH>A letter from Frank arrives at Mrs. Weston\u2019s house.<PARAGRAPH>As we\u2019ve mentioned before, everybody is into everybody else\u2019s business in this town. Emma, of course, reads the letter.<PARAGRAPH>Frank writes very, very nicely. In fact, he\u2019s a perfect gentleman on paper.<PARAGRAPH>Emma notes that Frank says good things about Harriet in his letter. Could he\u2026? And Harriet?<PARAGRAPH>Hmm\u2026it\u2019s an interesting idea. Emma gives up her (supposed) love interest in Frank. After all, arranging a match is just so much more interesting than being in one.<PARAGRAPH>Harriet\u2019s still moping about Mr. Elton. Let\u2019s be honest \u2013 Eeyore is probably more well-adjusted than Harriet.<PARAGRAPH>Emma argues that Harriet\u2019s fixation on Mr. Elton is actually a slap in the face to Emma, which snaps Harriet out of her misery. In Harriet\u2019s world, Mr. Elton might be perfect, but Miss Woodhouse \u2013 well, Miss Woodhouse is in a class of her own.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, Emma feels exactly the same way.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-thirty-one"}
