{"name": "Chapter Three", "summary": "The chapter in which we learn of the social life of the Woodhouses: even though Mr. Woodhouse is about as persnickety as it gets, he still throws regular dinner and card parties \u2013 which Emma, of course, arranges.<PARAGRAPH>For a small town, Highbury has a pretty elaborate set of social hierarchies, and we learn all about it here.<PARAGRAPH>Emma and her father are A-listers, of course, and so are the Westons and Mr. Elton, the local clergyman (he\u2019s also young and handsome, which doesn\u2019t hurt his social status at all).<PARAGRAPH>Of course, no town is complete without its B-listers (read: spinsters and working women). Highbury has the Bateses (Mrs. Bates and her daughter). Don\u2019t worry about getting them mixed up: they\u2019re supposed to be pretty interchangeable at first.<PARAGRAPH>The Bateses always come to the Woodhouses\u2019 parties, if only because Miss Bates loves to gossip, which makes her a perfect companion for Mr. Woodhouse.<PARAGRAPH>At this particular party, Mrs. Goddard, the head of a local girl\u2019s school, asks to present her star pupil to Emma.<PARAGRAPH>Harriet Smith is seventeen. She\u2019s pretty and almost-smart \u2013 which makes her a perfect sidekick.<PARAGRAPH>No one knows who Harriet\u2019s parents are, although the narrator throws in an ironic observation that she must be somebody\u2019s daughter.<PARAGRAPH>Emma promptly decides that Harriet will be her new \"project.\"<PARAGRAPH>After all, a girl\u2019s got to have someone to help \u2013 and after Emma\u2019s through, she\u2019s sure that Harriet will be fit for \"good society\"!", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-three"}
