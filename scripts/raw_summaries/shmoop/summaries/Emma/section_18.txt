{"name": "Chapter Nineteen", "summary": "Emma decides to pay a long-overdue visit to the Bateses.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019d go more often, but\u2026well, they\u2019re just so poor. And, of course, there\u2019s the fact that Miss Bates only stops talking to gasp for air.<PARAGRAPH>As she and Harriet walk to the Bateses\u2019 house, Emma feels a slight tinge of guilt: Mr. Knightley\u2019s tried to lecture her about her social responsibility towards the Bateses before.<PARAGRAPH>At least Emma\u2019s timed her visit to avoid hearing about Miss Bates\u2019 niece, Jane Fairfax.<PARAGRAPH>\u2026or so she thinks.<PARAGRAPH>After blabbering about the Coles (social climbers, but more on them later) and other nobodies, Miss Bates tells Emma that a letter from Jane has just arrived.<PARAGRAPH>Settle in, folks \u2013 it\u2019ll be a long afternoon. Miss Bates likes to read all her letters aloud.<PARAGRAPH>And then repeat them for her deaf mother.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, our heroine outwits the witless Miss Bates.<PARAGRAPH>Emma gets Miss Bates to talk about the letter, not read it. (Sigh of relief from all readers here, please.)<PARAGRAPH>It turns out that Jane will soon arrive in Highbury.<PARAGRAPH>OK, so you\u2019re probably breathless to find out why. Read the book!<PARAGRAPH>Just kidding. Here\u2019s why: Jane was raised by the Campbells. Their daughter just got married (she\u2019s now Mrs. Dixon). Mr. and Mrs. Dixon just left for Ireland, which means that Jane has nowhere to live.<PARAGRAPH>Emma\u2019s slightly intrigued by Mr. Dixon. Could he be a spurned lover? When she hears that he once saved Jane\u2019s life, she\u2019s convinced. Jane is a woman with a past.<PARAGRAPH>And not just any kind of a past: a double-dealing, husband-stealing, dirty kind of a past.<PARAGRAPH>After all, why else would anybody ever choose to live with Mrs. and Miss Bates?<PARAGRAPH>As it turns out, Jane is also pretty sick right now. (Heartache, perhaps?)<PARAGRAPH>Before Miss Bates can repeat all the news again, Emma and Harriet escape. Lucky them.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-nineteen"}
