{"name": "Chapter Thirty-Two", "summary": "Mrs. Elton arrives in town.<PARAGRAPH>Emma immediately dislikes her.<PARAGRAPH>Her clothes are garish and pretentious \u2013 and her manners match her clothes.<PARAGRAPH>Even Mr. Elton\u2019s manners seem to have changed. He\u2019s not the perfect gentleman anymore. He simpers over his wife.<PARAGRAPH>Harriet doesn\u2019t seem to notice how coarse the new Mrs. Elton is \u2013 she\u2019s too invested in thinking that everything Mr. Elton does is perfect.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, manners are manners. Even if you hate someone\u2019s guts, you still pay them social visits.<PARAGRAPH>Accordingly, Emma pays Mrs. Elton a social visit.<PARAGRAPH>As they talk, Emma realizes that she dislikes Mrs. Elton even more than she originally thought possible.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Elton peppers her conversation with references to \"her brother, Mr. Suckling\" (the only rich family member she has).<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Suckling\u2019s name should speak for itself.<PARAGRAPH>Moreover, Mrs. Elton has the nerve to compare Emma\u2019s ancestral home, Hartfield, to the home that the Sucklings bought, Maple Grove.<PARAGRAPH>F.Y.I. \u2013 property values are a HUGE thing for this novel. Check out our discussion of Austen and property in the \"Symbols, Metaphors and Allegories\" section of this module.<PARAGRAPH>The quick and dirty version, however, goes something like this:<PARAGRAPH>Good families have had the same home for generations.<PARAGRAPH>Really, really good families have had the same home since the time of the cavemen.<PARAGRAPH>The Sucklings have had Maple Grove for about eleven years. In other words, they sort of suck.<PARAGRAPH>Moreover, talking about your property all the time is just about as vulgar as leaving the price tag on a new Prada. It\u2019s not cool if you\u2019ve got to point it out.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Elton chatters a lot. She even offers to introduce Emma to her friends (an offer which Emma secretly scorns).<PARAGRAPH>As if that weren\u2019t enough, Mrs. Elton brings up the fact that Mrs. Weston was once Emma\u2019s governess.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, Mrs. Elton was surprised to find Mrs. Weston to be so well-mannered.<PARAGRAPH>Moreover, Mrs. Elton just met Mr. Knightley \u2013 and she was surprised to find that he was actually a gentleman!<PARAGRAPH>That\u2019s enough for Emma. She loses it. Luckily, she\u2019s too angry to speak.<PARAGRAPH>The Eltons leave, convinced that Mrs. Elton has made a new best friend.<PARAGRAPH>Emma spends a good deal of time thinking about all the nasty things she\u2019ll have to say about the Eltons when Frank Churchill returns.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-thirty-two"}
