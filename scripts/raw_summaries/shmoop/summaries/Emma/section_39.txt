{"name": "Chapter Forty", "summary": "Harriet shows up at Emma\u2019s house with a strange parcel under her arm.<PARAGRAPH>She explains that she\u2019s ready to give up on Mr. Elton now (only a few months after he got married)!<PARAGRAPH>In the box, she\u2019s collected trinkets which memorialize her love for him. She\u2019s ready to burn it.<PARAGRAPH>Surprised, Emma asks Harriet what trinkets she could have collected.<PARAGRAPH>Harriet lovingly unwraps a wooden casket and pulls out a bit of \"plaister\" (sort of like a band-aid). Mr. Elton played with it once.<PARAGRAPH>It goes on. And believe us, it only gets more pathetic. It\u2019s also pretty funny.<PARAGRAPH>Harriet\u2019s got a pencil Mr. Elton used once.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s got lots more stuff. All of it would raise a fortune on EBay.<PARAGRAPH>Actually, that\u2019s not totally true. It\u2019s all mostly worthless.<PARAGRAPH>Emma happens to think Harriet\u2019s collection is pretty amusing, as well.<PARAGRAPH>She struggles to hide a laugh at the maudlin nature of her friend.<PARAGRAPH>Harriet insists on burning the entire contents of the box \u2013 even though Emma points out that the plaister might be useful later on. Who knows? Maybe she could cut herself while burning the box.<PARAGRAPH>After the box burns, Harriet confesses that she\u2019s beginning to fall in love again.<PARAGRAPH>Surprised and rather relieved, Emma sits down to listen.<PARAGRAPH>Harriet humbly asks Emma if she thinks that Harriet should even think about the new man she admires.<PARAGRAPH>After all, this man is a perfect gentleman.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s far above Harriet in rank and reputation \u2013 but Harriet is sure that he\u2019s shown some signs of affection for her!<PARAGRAPH>And he recently saved her from a horrible situation.<PARAGRAPH>Determined not to meddle in any more love affairs, Emma asks Harriet never to reveal her crush\u2019s name.<PARAGRAPH>(Of course, she\u2019s absolutely sure that it\u2019s Frank. After all, didn\u2019t he save her from the gypsies?)<PARAGRAPH>Emma couldn\u2019t be happier. Harriet and Frank would be perfect together.<PARAGRAPH>Sure, he\u2019s more eligible than she is \u2013 but Harriet is sweet enough and pretty enough to make up for her lack of fortune.<PARAGRAPH>She resolves to wish them well.<PARAGRAPH>Beyond that, however, she\u2019s not going to do anything to advance their love. She\u2019s had enough matchmaking for now.<PARAGRAPH>Saying enough to make Harriet happy, however, Emma manages to convince her that it\u2019s OK for her to think about (and even love) a man who outranks her socially.<PARAGRAPH>She tells Harriet, however, never to mention her man by name.<PARAGRAPH>That way, Emma\u2019s not really helping her along.<PARAGRAPH>They leave each other, confident that they\u2019ve not said enough so that they understand each other perfectly.<PARAGRAPH>...and anytime there\u2019s perfect understanding, there\u2019s got to be trouble ahead!", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-forty"}
