{"name": "Chapter Fifty-Three", "summary": "Mrs. Weston has a baby girl (Anna).<PARAGRAPH>Emma\u2019s delighted.<PARAGRAPH>As she tells Mr. Knightley, Mrs. Weston will have a chance to try again with a new girl.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, Mr. Knightley has to say some things about how loveable Emma is now.<PARAGRAPH>Even he admits, though, that she was a pretty spoiled kid.<PARAGRAPH>By now, we\u2019re sure that many of you are starting to think that Mr. Knightley sounds a lot like Mr. Big. (For those of you who don\u2019t watch Sex in the City, Big is a man with no apparent real name.) Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got you covered here. Big\u2019s first name is John. Knightley\u2019s first name is George.<PARAGRAPH>As Emma declares, however, she\u2019ll never call him anything but Mr. Knightley.<PARAGRAPH>(We\u2019re not really sure why. George is a perfectly nice name.)<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley receives a letter from his brother congratulating him about the engagement.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s clear that Mr. John Knightley thinks that Mr. Knightley is getting the short end of the stick.<PARAGRAPH>Surprisingly, Emma agrees. She\u2019s lucky to have Mr. Knightley.<PARAGRAPH>There\u2019s one last problem: how should Emma tell her father?<PARAGRAPH>She plans to enlist the Westons\u2019 help, but finally she manages to gather up enough courage to tell Mr. Woodhouse on her own.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s devastated, naturally.<PARAGRAPH>But he does like Mr. Knightley more than anyone (except Emma, of course).<PARAGRAPH>And he does like to have him around all the time.<PARAGRAPH>Perhaps this won\u2019t be as devastating as he originally thought.<PARAGRAPH>Fortunately, the Westons are very excited about the news.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Weston (who is, we\u2019ve figured out, probably a bigger gossip than Miss Bates) tells the entire town.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Elton foresees a disastrous future for them.<PARAGRAPH>If she hates something, it must be a good sign!", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-fifty-three"}
