{"name": "Chapter Twenty", "summary": "Our narrator gives us all the dirt on Jane Fairfax.<PARAGRAPH>Her parents died when she was a baby, but a friend of her father\u2019s (Capt. Campbell) offered to raise her. He\u2019s got a daughter that\u2019s Jane\u2019s age.<PARAGRAPH>Jane is, apparently, perfect. (Can you see why Emma hates her now?)<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s prettier, smarter, and all-around better than her friend Miss Campbell.<PARAGRAPH>For some reason, however, Miss Campbell and Jane love each other like sisters.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, as you\u2019ve probably figured out by now, in this novel pretty girls don\u2019t get too far on their looks alone.<PARAGRAPH>Jane\u2019s poor. Miss Campbell is rich. Miss Campbell gets engaged; Jane has to find a job as a governess.<PARAGRAPH>The Campbells love Jane like a daughter, but they can\u2019t give her any of their money.<PARAGRAPH>Why not?<PARAGRAPH>This means that Jane has to go out into the wide, wide world.<PARAGRAPH>The Campbells put it off as long as possible, but Jane decides that, once she turns 21, she\u2019s cutting the cord.<PARAGRAPH>Fortunately, right after she turns 21, she gets sick.<PARAGRAPH>And that brings us up to speed with Jane. Now back to Emma:<PARAGRAPH>Emma sort of hates Jane (in the sense that she's slightly envious).<PARAGRAPH>In other words, Emma\u2019s pretty smart \u2013 she knows that Jane is more accomplished than she is.<PARAGRAPH>To make matters worse, Mr. Knightley constantly tells Emma that Jane is better than she is. Even if you didn\u2019t hate Jane before, wouldn\u2019t you hate her now?<PARAGRAPH>Despite her past history, Emma decides to start afresh.<PARAGRAPH>Emma visits Jane and is pleasantly surprised at how pretty and elegant she is (congratulating herself, of course, about how open-minded she\u2019s being for coming to this conclusion).<PARAGRAPH>Before long, however, things are back to normal.<PARAGRAPH>It starts when Jane comes to Hartfield with her aunts.<PARAGRAPH>The combination of Miss Bates\u2019 chatter and Jane\u2019s refusal to dish on Frank Churchill (whom she met in Weymouth) makes Emma think Jane insufferable.<PARAGRAPH>And unbearable. And lots of other nasty words we won\u2019t mention here.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-twenty"}
