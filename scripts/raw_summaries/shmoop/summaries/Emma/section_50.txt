It\u2019s about as good as most of her plans have been.<PARAGRAPH>If they wait to get married until after Mr. Woodhouse dies, Emma argues, then he\u2019ll never be unhappy.<PARAGRAPH>We told you it was a crappy plan.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, Mr. Knightley agrees with our opinion. He\u2019s got an alternate solution.<PARAGRAPH>Instead of Emma moving to Donwell Abbey, Mr. Knightley proposes that he should move into Hartfield.<PARAGRAPH>That way, Mr. Woodhouse never has to leave his own home.<PARAGRAPH>Astonished at Mr. Knightley\u2019s liberality, Emma immediately agrees to think it over.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, she pretty much agrees to agree.<PARAGRAPH>Harriet remains the only sticky point in Emma\u2019s life now.<PARAGRAPH>And, as Emma reflects, it\u2019s probably too much to expect that Harriet could love three men in one year.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-fifty-one"}
