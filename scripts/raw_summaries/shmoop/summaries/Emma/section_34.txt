{"name": "Chapter Thirty-Five", "summary": "After dinner, Emma notices with a bit of dismay that the conversation seems to break into two distinct parties.<PARAGRAPH>Even her best efforts as a hostess don\u2019t detach Mrs. Elton from Jane\u2019s side.<PARAGRAPH>Prodded by Mrs. Elton into talking about her future, Jane says that she won\u2019t be returning to live with the Campbells once they return from Ireland.<PARAGRAPH>She\u2019s determined to make her own living as a governess.<PARAGRAPH>We interrupt this program for a brief history lesson:<PARAGRAPH>Amazingly enough, nineteenth-century England isn\u2019t exactly known for its gender equality.<PARAGRAPH>Unmarried gentlewomen had very few options. And those options weren\u2019t exactly lucrative.<PARAGRAPH>If you happened to have wealthy relatives, you could sponge off of them for the rest of your life.<PARAGRAPH>If you didn\u2019t have wealthy relatives, you could become a governess.<PARAGRAPH>This involved caring for whiny kids (and making pretty awful wages) for the rest of your life. (For a happier ending to this story, see Jane Eyre.)<PARAGRAPH>That\u2019s it. Pretty short interruption, huh? That\u2019s because there weren\u2019t all that many options out there.<PARAGRAPH>OK, back to our party: Mrs. Elton, helpful as ever, barges into the conversation and demands that Jane allow her to find a family for Jane.<PARAGRAPH>Jane refuses. Mrs. Elton refuses to accept her refusal. (Again. And again. And again.)<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Weston enters with news: Frank writes that he will soon move with his aunt to a vacation spot about nine miles away from Highbury.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s close enough to allow Frank to come over all the time.<PARAGRAPH>Emma\u2019s thrilled. Mr. Knightley doesn\u2019t look so pleased.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-thirty-five"}
