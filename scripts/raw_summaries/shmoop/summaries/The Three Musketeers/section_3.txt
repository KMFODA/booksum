{"name": "Chapter Three: The Audience", "summary": "D\u2019Artagnan shows up to talk to M. de Tr\u00e9ville, who smiles upon seeing the young Gascon.<PARAGRAPH>Before they start talking, however, Tr\u00e9ville calls for Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos and Aramis immediately hustle over and everyone outside the room starts gossiping about the summons.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville chews them out. It turns out that on the day before yesterday, the Musketeers were rioting in the streets and had to be arrested by the Cardinal\u2019s Guards. Said Musketeers included\u2014you guessed it\u2014Aramis, Porthos, and Athos.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville starts swearing at his men, cursing himself for picking them, and then realizes that Athos isn\u2019t present.<PARAGRAPH>Aramis and Porthos tell Tr\u00e9ville that Athos is sick with smallpox. (A total lie.)<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville points out that Athos is too old to have smallpox, and speculates that Athos is likely wounded.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville tells them that all the misbehaving needs to stop, ASAP. It is horribly embarrassing to have the Cardinal\u2019s men (the Musketeers\u2019 biggest rivals) arrest the Musketeers for indecent behavior.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos and Aramis shuffle uncomfortably. Outside the door, all the rest of the Musketeers listen intently. Soon the entire hotel knows what\u2019s going on.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville continues to rant, threatening to resign. It took only six of the Cardinal\u2019s guards to arrest six Musketeers.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone outside the room starts yelling and cursing. D\u2019Artagnan feels awkward.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos is angry; he confesses that two Musketeers were killed before anyone could draw their swords, and Athos was badly wounded. All the Musketeers continued to fight, but the Cardinal\u2019s guards dragged them away. Porthos and Aramis managed to escape, and Athos was left for dead.<PARAGRAPH>Not to be outdone, Aramis tells his boss that he (Aramis) killed one of the guards with the guard\u2019s own sword.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville is happy to hear that. Obviously the Cardinal kept that on the down-low.<PARAGRAPH>Aramis then asks Tr\u00e9ville not to tell anyone that Athos is wounded.<PARAGRAPH>Right on time, Athos shows up. He\u2019s pale and obviously in a great deal of pain. He\u2019s hiding it well though.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville is excited to see him. He tells Athos that the Musketeers shouldn\u2019t risk their lives needlessly. He then grips Athos\u2019s hand.<PARAGRAPH>Athos cringes in pain and grows even paler.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone listening outside the door gets excited and a few people poke their heads in.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville is about to yell at them when Athos faints.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville immediately starts freaking out and calling for the doctor in charge of the King.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, the King\u2019s doctor happens to be in the building. He rushes over to Athos and demands that the Musketeer be carried into another room.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos and Aramis carry their friend into another room and the surgeon follows.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, all the men left in Tr\u00e9ville\u2019s room start yelling and cursing the Cardinal and his guards.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos and Aramis return, along with Tr\u00e9ville. The surgeon declares that Athos fainted due to loss of blood but that he\u2019s okay now.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville orders everyone out so only D\u2019Artagnan is left.<PARAGRAPH>For a moment, Tr\u00e9ville has to be reminded of why D\u2019Artagnan is there. Based on his respect for D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s father, he asks what he can do for D\u2019Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan says his dearest wish is to become a Musketeer, but that he realizes the enormity of the request.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville says yes, it\u2019s hard. You need the King\u2019s approval and you need to be an awesome fighter. The easy way in is to serve with a lesser regiment for two years.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville offers to get D\u2019Artagnan into the Royal Academy, where he can learn to be a proper gentleman: horsemanship, swordsmanship, dancing. He then tells D\u2019Artagnan to drop by sometime and say hi.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan realizes that Tr\u00e9ville is being a bit cold, and laments the loss of his letter out loud.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville expresses his surprise that D\u2019Artagnan has no such letter. D\u2019Artagnan says: well, I lost it. He proceeds to tell Tr\u00e9ville all about what happened at Meung.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville recognizes the description of the man who got D\u2019Artagnan beaten up.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville asks about the stranger\u2019s interaction with the beautiful woman. It\u2019s clear that Tr\u00e9ville knows the man\u2019s identity.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan begs to be told the man\u2019s identity so he can go avenge himself.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville warns him away from this course of action, and then starts getting suspicious of D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s true intentions. Maybe D\u2019Artagnan is really the Cardinal\u2019s spy! Who knows in these uncertain times?! He resolves to test D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s loyalties.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville assures D\u2019Artagnan that despite all their quarreling, the King and the Cardinal are actually BFFs, and that he is perfectly devoted to both. If D\u2019Artagnan is going to do anything against the Cardinal, Tr\u00e9ville wants nothing to do with him.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville assumes that if D\u2019Artagnan is truly a spy from the Cardinal, he will overcompensate and start ranting about the Cardinal\u2019s flaws.<PARAGRAPH>To Tr\u00e9ville\u2019s surprise, D\u2019Artagnan agrees. He says that his father told him to respect only the Cardinal, the King, and Tr\u00e9ville.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville says that he\u2019ll wait and see how D\u2019Artagnan conducts himself. D\u2019Artagnan tells the elder man that he will not have to wait long.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville goes to write the letter of recommendation to the director of the Royal Academy. D\u2019Artagnan paces around the room and gazes out the window. Right before he\u2019s about to receive the letter of recommendation, he spots the Man from Meung and runs away.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville suspects this may be another ploy.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112556/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-three-the-audience"}
