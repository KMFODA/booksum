{"name": "Chapter Twenty-Five: Porthos", "summary": "Rather than go home, D\u2019Artagnan goes to visit Tr\u00e9ville. He tells his mentor the full and honest truth, hoping for some advice.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville is convinced that the Cardinal is behind it all.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville promises to tell the Queen that Constance has been kidnapped, and recommends that D\u2019Artagnan leave Paris immediately.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan heads home in order to pack for his journey, and spots Monsieur Bonacieux. He is suspicious, and the narrator tells us that \"all falsehood is a mask\u2026 with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face.\"<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is determined that Bonacieux wears such a mask of falsehood and tries to brush past him, but Bonacieux starts chatting. He makes fun of D\u2019Artagnan for coming home when everyone else is going out.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan says something about Bonacieux\u2019s pretty wife, and the man pales.<PARAGRAPH>Then Bonacieux says that D\u2019Artagnan must\u2019ve really been somewhere unusual, because there\u2019s mud all over his boots. D\u2019Artagnan looks down, and sees the same mud splotches on Bonacieux\u2019s boots.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan determines that the small, \"not-a-gentleman-man\" from last night must have been Bonacieux. He aided in the kidnapping of his wife!<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is ready to kill Bonacieux then and there, but he restrains himself. Still, D\u2019Artagnan looks so fearsome that Bonacieux is scared.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan opts for pointing out that Bonacieux\u2019s boots look just as dirty as his own. Bonacieux says that he went to St. Mande to ask after a servant.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan, switching to interrogator mode, is now certain that Bonacieux was at St. Cloud last night, because St. Mande is in the opposite direction. He realizes that Bonacieux likely knows where his wife is being held, and resolves to get that information from him.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan asks for some water, and before Bonacieux can reply, D\u2019Artagnan ducks into Bonacieux\u2019s house. Bonacieux\u2019s bed has not been used.<PARAGRAPH>After drinking some water, D\u2019Artagnan leaves for his own apartment.<PARAGRAPH>When he walks in, Planchet is happy to see him.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently a certain Monsieur de Cavois, the captain of the Cardinal\u2019s Guards, paid the apartment a visit while D\u2019Artagnan was consulting with Tr\u00e9ville.<PARAGRAPH>The man did not come to arrest D\u2019Artagnan; on the contrary he bore well wishes from the Cardinal and asked D\u2019Artagnan to follow him to the Palais-Royal. Since D\u2019Artagnan wasn\u2019t home, the captain asked for D\u2019Artagnan to call upon him at some point that day.<PARAGRAPH>Planchet tells the captain that D\u2019Artagnan has set off for Champagne.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan congratulates Planchet on his quick thinking; Planchet says he knew D\u2019Artagnan would have time to correct the lie if he wanted, and that since he (Planchet) is not a gentleman, he\u2019s allowed to lie.<PARAGRAPH>The two of them get ready to leave Paris\u2014in the opposite direction of Champagne. D\u2019Artagnan tells Planchet that he was right about Bonacieux.<PARAGRAPH>Before leaving, D\u2019Artagnan visits his friends\u2019 houses one more time to make sure that no new information has come. At Aramis\u2019s house, there is a pretty and perfumed letter waiting.<PARAGRAPH>The two of them travel with four horses in order to bring back their friends. (These are the horses, incidentally, which D\u2019Artagnan used to ride back from Calais. They are English horses, a present from the Duke.)<PARAGRAPH>They reach Chantilly with no problem and arrive at the inn where they left Porthos. D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s got four horses, so he\u2019s looking like a VIP to the innkeeper, who comes over personally to serve him some wine.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan begins to ask about Porthos, and learns that Porthos is still at the inn, hasn\u2019t paid his bill, and threatens to kill anyone who asks for money.<PARAGRAPH>(Apparently Porthos gambled away the seventy-five pistoles, along with his horse.)<PARAGRAPH>Porthos continues to hang out at this inn, occupying the best room, refusing to leave, and refusing to pay his bill. Mousqueton has also rejoined his master.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan tries to allay the innkeeper\u2019s fears, pointing out that Porthos is favored by a wealthy woman who will pay the bill. The innkeeper\u2019s expresses doubt, saying that he has knows all about this great lady<PARAGRAPH>To make a long story short, Porthos\u2019s mistress is the wife of an attorney. (Now, while attorneys make are well respected today, back in the 17th century they were distinctly part of the middle-class, and leagues away from the upper-class of dukes and duchesses.)<PARAGRAPH>The mistress\u2019s name is Madame Coquenard, and she is not exactly beautiful. In fact, she\u2019s fifty years old and is very jealous of Porthos. (When she receives a letter from him about his wound and financial distress, she is convinced it is because of another woman!)<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan asks if Porthos is really wounded, and the innkeeper confesses that Porthos forbids anyone to admit it. He was beaten up badly by his adversary, but refuses to admit it to anyone except his mistress.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan goes to visit Porthos. Before D\u2019Artagnan leaves, he assures the innkeeper that if Porthos\u2019s mistress will pay the bill. If she doesn\u2019t, however, D\u2019Artagnan promises that he will take care of the account, which is already upwards of twenty pistoles.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan enters Pothos\u2019s room to find him gambling with Mousqueton while food cooks over a fire. Empty wine bottles line the mantles.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos says hello, and soon entertains his company with highly embroidered stories. For instance, he says he beat up his adversary, but got a tiny little sprain in the process, which has confined him to his bed.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan fills Porthos in on his end of the story.<PARAGRAPH>It transpires that the faithful Mousqueton has been poaching animals and stealing wine to keep the two well fed.<PARAGRAPH>We learn a bit about Mousqueton\u2019s background here.<PARAGRAPH>During the war between Catholics and the Huguenots in France, Mousqueton\u2019s father opted for a mixed religious system. When he saw a Catholic, all his Protestant beliefs would rise up and he would pull out his gun and talk religion until the Catholic handed over his money. When he saw a Huguenot, the reverse would happen.<PARAGRAPH>In keeping with his mixed religious beliefs, Mousqueton\u2019s father raised Mousqueton as a Catholic, and his older brother as a Protestant.<PARAGRAPH>Mousqueton\u2019s father was killed one day when a Catholic and a Huguenot both recognized him. Being a devoted son, Mousqueton later killed the Huguenot, and his brother took care of the Catholic.<PARAGRAPH>Mousqueton\u2019s father was also a poacher in his spare time, and he taught Mousqueton the basics.<PARAGRAPH>The next story concerns the procuring of wine.<PARAGRAPH>In Spain Mousqueton learned a number of lassoing techniques that enable him to use the ventilation window in the wine cellar to steal bottles of wine without the innkeeper noticing.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan tells Porthos that a horse will be left in the stables for him, and that he (D\u2019Artagnan) must find Aramis and Athos.<PARAGRAPH>Planchet comes in to report the horses are ready, and they bid Porthos farewell.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112556/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-twenty-five-porthos"}
