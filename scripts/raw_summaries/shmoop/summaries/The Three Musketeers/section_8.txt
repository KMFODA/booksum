{"name": "Chapter Eight: Concerning a Court Intrigue", "summary": "The King\u2019s forty pistoles come to an end, and Athos supports everyone for a while. Then Porthos supports the four friends, then Aramis.<PARAGRAPH>Then Porthos, Aramis, and Athos hit up Tr\u00e9ville for some advances on their pay. D\u2019Artagnan, being a lowly Guard, doesn\u2019t get paid at all.<PARAGRAPH>When they start starving, they scrape together some money that they give to Porthos to gamble with. He loses the money.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, they start hitting up all their friends. Porthos, Aramis, Athos, and D\u2019Artagnan\u2014along with their servants\u2014visit various friends for dinner.<PARAGRAPH>This mooching method can only last for so long, however. D\u2019Artagnan is convinced that four \"young, brave, enterprising, and active men\" should be able to do better than this.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is concocting plans for the four of them when someone knocks at the door. D\u2019Artagnan wakes Planchet up and tells him to answer it. The narrator tells us that it\u2019s long past morning. Planchet was sleeping because there was no food to eat.<PARAGRAPH>A man with the \"appearance of a tradesman\" walks in and requests a private conversation with D\u2019Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>They stare awkwardly at each other before the man asks if he can share a secret.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan crosses his heart, hopes to die before repeating the secret.<PARAGRAPH>Turns out the man\u2019s wife works as the Queen\u2019s seamstress. The Queen\u2019s cloak bearer happens to be the man\u2019s wife\u2019s godfather.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s okay to be confused at this point. The main thing to get out of the conversation is that the man\u2019s wife has been kidnapped\u2014and he has a suspect.<PARAGRAPH>The man is moreover convinced that the issue is politics, not sex.<PARAGRAPH>We learn that the delicate issue at hand is the Queen\u2019s illicit relationship with the Duke of Buckingham.<PARAGRAPH>The Cardinal is angry about this, not because of any real moral reasons that you might attribute to a churchman, but because he\u2019s been hot for the Queen himself. He was so hot for her, in fact, that he once dressed up as a clown and danced the saraband for her. (We looked up \"saraband\", and thanks to dictionary.com, and found this: 1.) A fast, erotic dance of the 16th century of Mexico and Spain. 2.) A stately court dance of the 17th and 18th centuries, in slow triple time. 3.) The music for either of these dances.)<PARAGRAPH>The book doesn\u2019t tell us which kind of saraband the Cardinal used to woo the Queen, but we\u2019re guessing neither was very effective.<PARAGRAPH>Although we give the Cardinal props for trying, the truth remains that he is out for some revenge.<PARAGRAPH>The Queen is convinced that someone has written to the Duke of Buckingham using her name.<PARAGRAPH>The bad guys have kidnapped the man\u2019s wife in order to use the woman against the Queen.<PARAGRAPH>Although the man knows who abducted his wife, he doesn\u2019t know the abductor\u2019s name. All he knows is that the man is an agent of the Cardinal.<PARAGRAPH>After getting a description of the abductor, D\u2019Artagnan identifies the abductor as the Man from Meung.<PARAGRAPH>Finally we learn the visitor\u2019s name\u2014Monsieur Bonacieux. (The visitor also happens to be D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s landlord, and politely reminds the young Gascon that he\u2019s three months behind on rent!)<PARAGRAPH>But Monsieur Bonacieux strikes a deal with D\u2019Artagnan\u2014if D\u2019Artagnan agrees to save Madame Bonacieux, he gets fifty pistoles and never has to pay rent again.<PARAGRAPH>Their conversation is cut short when they both spot the Man from Meung standing across the street.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan immediately draws his sword and runs outside, on the way bumping into Athos and Porthos, (who want to live up to that Inseparables title).<PARAGRAPH>They stay out of D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s way and go into his apartment to wait for his return.<PARAGRAPH>When they get there, Bonacieux is gone.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112556/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-eight-concerning-a-court-intrigue"}
