{"name": "Chapter Twenty: The Journey", "summary": "(Advance warning: a map of 17th Century England and France would be useful here if you want to track the path taken by our young adventurers.)<PARAGRAPH>They leave at two o\u2019clock in the morning slightly fearful, but by the time morning hits they\u2019re in a great and sunny mood.<PARAGRAPH>They reach Chantilly (a city north of Paris) at about eight in the morning ready to eat breakfast. They dismount at an inn and tell the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses in case they need to make a quick getaway.<PARAGRAPH>A gentleman is eating at the same table as they are, and insists on making small talk. When Mousqueton (Porthos\u2019s servant) comes in to announce that the horses are ready, the stranger asks Porthos to toast to the health of the Cardinal. Porthos says he will do so only if the stranger drinks to the health of the King.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger says he bows only to the Cardinal, and Porthos calls him a drunk, at which point it\u2019s all over and the two draw their swords.<PARAGRAPH>Athos yells \"Good luck!\" as the other three mount their horses, leaving Porthos behind to fight.<PARAGRAPH>They stop later in the trip, but Porthos does not rejoin them.<PARAGRAPH>Later, they come across \"eight or ten men who\u2026 appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with mud.\"<PARAGRAPH>Aramis is upset at getting his boots dirty and says so, at which point the workers start insulting them. And then they pull out some guns.<PARAGRAPH>Aramis and Mousqueton are both hit. Mousqueton falls from his horse.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan yells for them to move forward, and Mousqueton\u2019s horse rejoins them as they continue down the road.<PARAGRAPH>They continue on, but their horses are tired. And Aramis is wounded. At Cr\u00e8vecoeur (another city in France), they leave Aramis and Bazin behind to recuperate.<PARAGRAPH>So to recount: we have Athos and D\u2019Artagnan, along with their lackeys Grimaud and Planchet. Athos swears he will not fall into any more verbal traps and the four press forward. They reach Amiens at midnight.<PARAGRAPH>The host of their hotel is nice, which is naturally suspicious. Despite being offered rooms at opposite ends of the hotel, D\u2019Artagnan and Athos opt to sleep together in the common room.<PARAGRAPH>Planchet and Grimaud show up.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s decided that Grimaud will stay with the horses to make sure they\u2019re ready to go at five in the morning (that would be five hours from now), and that Planchet will serve as a bodyguard by sleeping outside their door.<PARAGRAPH>At four o\u2019clock they find Grimaud beaten unconscious. Planchet goes down to get the horses ready, but none of them are in any fit condition to ride.<PARAGRAPH>Athos goes to pay their bill while Planchet notices two nice horses all ready to go.<PARAGRAPH>When Athos goes to pay his bill, the innkeeper takes a look at the money and calls Athos and his companions frauds and yells for them to be arrested. Athos yells for D\u2019Artagnan to run while he fights four armed men.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan and Planchet grab two horses and leave.<PARAGRAPH>The two horses completely give up as they\u2019re about to reach Calais. (Calais is the port city of France from which they can leave for England.)<PARAGRAPH>They run to the docks. But wait! There\u2019s someone already there with his servant. This gentleman is also in a huge rush to get across the channel.<PARAGRAPH>There\u2019s a ship captain waiting conveniently by the docks, but he informs both D\u2019Artagnan and the stranger that no one can sail without the permission of the Cardinal.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger has permission, but needs the governor of the port to countersign it.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan picks a fight with the stranger and beats him up. Planchet beats up the stranger\u2019s servant.<PARAGRAPH>Our hero then finds the necessary permission slip and notes that the stranger\u2019s identity is \"Comte de Wardes.\" He takes a look at the unconscious young man and has a moment of remorse for the fact that both of them are risking their lives for other people\u2019s messes.<PARAGRAPH>They drag Comte de Wardes over to a tree and tie his servant to the tree.<PARAGRAPH>They head over to the governor\u2019s house and D\u2019Artagnan announces himself as the Comte de Wardes. While chatting with the governor, D\u2019Artagnan drops the hint that a dastardly man, by the name of D\u2019Artagnan, is trying to cross the Channel. D\u2019Artagnan then gives the governor a description of the Comte de Wardes. Very tricky...<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan heads back to the wharf and jumps on board the ship to England.<PARAGRAPH>They reach the other side of the Channel at ten-thirty in the morning and then arrive in London a few hours later. Although he doesn\u2019t speak English, D\u2019Artagnan is soon directed to the Duke\u2019s residence.<PARAGRAPH>It turns out the Duke is out hunting with the King.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan manages to convince the Duke\u2019s servant that he needs to talk to the most powerful man in England, and they go track the Duke down.<PARAGRAPH>The Duke immediately asks if the Queen is okay, and D\u2019Artagnan hands him the letter. The Duke reads it and tells his servant to make his excuses to the King because he needs to get back to London immediately.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112556/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-twenty-the-journey"}
