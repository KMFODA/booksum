{"name": "Chapter One: The Three Presents of D\u2019Artagnan the Elder", "summary": "We start our tale with a historical info-dump.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s the first Monday of April, 1625, and we\u2019re in a small town experiencing a lot of pandemonium.<PARAGRAPH>This kind of activity is apparently quite usual, and we get a quick overview of the types of conflict common at this point in history: nobles vs. nobles, King vs. Cardinal, Spain vs. King, lots of bad people vs. citizens.<PARAGRAPH>This story is also taking place in France.<PARAGRAPH>The cause of all the chaos is a young man the narrator describes as a \"Don Quixote of eighteen.\" If you\u2019re not up on your Spanish literature, Don Quixote is this ordinary guy who starts believing he\u2019s a gallant knight, so in other words, the young man in our story looks like an idealistic (though intelligent) fool. It\u2019s also clear, from his massive jawbone that he\u2019s from Gascony. According to our annotated edition, that means he\u2019s likely to have a quick temper and lots of courage.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator tells us that the young man would likely be taken for a farmer\u2019s son if it wasn\u2019t for the sword he (inexpertly) carries.<PARAGRAPH>The young man rides an old yellow horse with no hair in its tail; the old horse also walks funny.<PARAGRAPH>In short, the young man (who we finally learn is named D\u2019Artagnan) is riding the 17th century equivalent of a Ford Edsel.<PARAGRAPH>It turns out the horse is a gift from his father (also known as D\u2019Artagnan the elder).<PARAGRAPH>We get a flashback to the day dad gave away the horse. He tells D\u2019Artagnan the younger to never sell the horse and to take care of it like an old servant.<PARAGRAPH>He then launches into a long lecture which can be summed up like this: honor; courage; obey the Cardinal and the King; go out and have lots of adventures and pick a lot of fights even though they\u2019re illegal; here are fifteen crowns, a horse, and my advice; your mother is including some balsam which will take care of all the injuries you\u2019re going to have.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan the elder adds that he\u2019s buddy-buddy with a really important guy at court named Monsieur de Tr\u00e9ville, (also referred to as M. de Tr\u00e9ville or just Tr\u00e9ville), whom he\u2019s recommending as the role model for his son. He gives his D\u2019Artagnan the younger a letter of introduction, which reads something like: hello old friend, the guy who just handed you this letter is my son, please treat him well.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan the elder outfits his son with a sword and wishes him luck.<PARAGRAPH>Then D\u2019Artagnan (the younger) goes to say good-bye to his mom. They both cry. This doesn\u2019t indicate that D\u2019Artagnan is weak, just that he really loves his mom. Aww.<PARAGRAPH>And then our hero\u2019s off! He has fifteen crowns, a horse, and a letter of introduction (the three presents mentioned in the title of this chapter).<PARAGRAPH>During his journey, D\u2019Artagnan is always raring for a fight (because everyone keeps laughing at his ridiculous horse), but he manages to make it to Meung (another city in France) in one piece.<PARAGRAPH>He gets to an inn called the Jolly Miller, and as he\u2019s getting down from the horse he spies an authoritative man telling jokes to two other men.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s horse is the joke.<PARAGRAPH>Uh-oh.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan stares at the guy in charge for a good long while memorizing the his looks: he\u2019s about forty, with black eyes and fair skin.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan walks over to the man with his hand on his sword. He\u2019s ready for a big, eloquent speech but instead blurts out: \"What you laughing at?\" Or something like that.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger replies, \"Did I look like I was talking to you?\"<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan comes back with, \"But I\u2019m talking to you!\"<PARAGRAPH>The stranger ignores him.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan pulls out his sword.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger continues making fun of D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s horse. D\u2019Artagnan continues to threaten him, and the stranger continues to be polite and scornful at the same time. D\u2019Artagnan continues to demand a fight.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger sighs and says D\u2019Artagnan should really be a Musketeer if he wants to be so brave.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan nearly skewers the stranger.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, the stranger draws his sword.<PARAGRAPH>Before we get to see a swordfight, the innkeeper and the two men start beating on D\u2019Artagnan with \"sticks, shovels, and tongs.\"<PARAGRAPH>The stranger says that they should just shove D\u2019Artagnan back on the funny horse and send him on his way.<PARAGRAPH>As three men beat him with sticks, shovels, and tongs, D\u2019Artagnan says to the stranger, \"I\u2019m not leaving until you\u2019re dead.\"<PARAGRAPH>The stranger tells the three men to continue beating D\u2019Artagnan, figuring that the fight will end soon enough.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan continues to stand there and take the beating. His sword breaks in two. Finally, someone cracks him on the head and he falls over.<PARAGRAPH>The innkeeper takes him to the kitchen for some first aid.<PARAGRAPH>The innkeeper goes back to ask the stranger (who\u2019s apparently kind of a big deal) if he\u2019s okay. Because the stranger was totally involved in the \"fighting.\"<PARAGRAPH>The stranger says that he\u2019s fine, and asks how D\u2019Artagnan is doing.<PARAGRAPH>The innkeeper says that the young man has fainted again, but not before swearing to kill the stranger. Again.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger exclaims that D\u2019Artagnan must be the devil.<PARAGRAPH>No, says the innkeeper, we went through his stuff and found a shirt and some money. (Which means D\u2019Artagnan is definitely not the devil\u2026?)<PARAGRAPH>The innkeeper tells the stranger that D\u2019Artagnan stuck his hand into his pocket and mentioned the name of M. de Tr\u00e9ville. The innkeeper saw that D\u2019Artagnan has a letter addressed to Tr\u00e9ville.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger gets all excited, then goes to the window and mutters under his breath, \"Could M. de Tr\u00e9ville have sent this crazy young man here to kill me?\" He stares out the window contemplating the possibilities before finally turning back to the innkeeper and asking him to get rid of D\u2019Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger orders his horses ready for his departure.<PARAGRAPH>We learn that D\u2019Artagnan has been taken to another room to have his wounds treated.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger continues to mutter to himself, so we get to hear his dastardly plans: he doesn\u2019t want Milady to be seen by D\u2019Artagnan, and he is interested in seeing this letter addressed to Tr\u00e9ville.<PARAGRAPH>The innkeeper blames D\u2019Artagnan for the departure of the noble stranger; he goes straight to D\u2019Artagnan and insists that he leave the inn immediately.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan, still wounded, struggles to his feet and steps out of the room.<PARAGRAPH>The first thing he sees is the stranger talking to someone sitting in a carriage.<PARAGRAPH>This someone happens to be a beautiful young woman: blonde haired, blue-eyed, and with skin like alabaster. The stranger is relaying a set of orders to her. When she asks him if he\u2019s going to punish the \"insolent boy\" (meaning D\u2019Artagnan), D\u2019Artagnan has to pipe up, \"Are you talking about me?\"<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is convinced that the stranger would not dare to flee from a fight in front of a lady.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger does just that\u2014he gallops away on his horse as the innkeeper screams out, \"What about your bill?!?!\"<PARAGRAPH>The stranger yells for one of his servants to pay the innkeeper. D\u2019Artagnan chases after the stranger yelling \"Base Coward! False Gentleman!\"<PARAGRAPH>Then his head injuries get the best of him and he collapses.<PARAGRAPH>The innkeeper tries to make nice with D\u2019Artagnan since the other guy turned out to be a jerk.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan regains consciousness long enough to talk about the beautiful woman, then faints again.<PARAGRAPH>The innkeeper feels better when he anticipates that D\u2019Artagnan must stay at the inn and recuperate for quite some time.<PARAGRAPH>Wrong!<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan gets together the ingredients for his mother\u2019s balsam, and is essentially cured within two days.<PARAGRAPH>When he goes to pay for his lodging and meals, D\u2019Artagnan discovers that his letter of introduction to M. de Tr\u00e9ville is missing.<PARAGRAPH>He flies into a rage and demands that it be found. He does this over and over again until everyone grabs the sticks, shovels, and tongs they used earlier. They don\u2019t beat him quite yet, but they\u2019re close.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan pulls out his sword, forgetting that two inches of metal does not constitute a sword. (It was broken in the earlier fight, remember?)<PARAGRAPH>The narrator points out that this would probably not prevent D\u2019Artagnan from continuing to threaten the inn employees. Luckily, something penetrates the innkeeper\u2019s brain. He lowers his stick and asks rhetorically, \"But where is your letter?\"<PARAGRAPH>After putting their heads together, the innkeeper finally has an \"Aha!\" moment and tells D\u2019Artagnan that the stranger from earlier must have taken it.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan pays the innkeeper and sets off for Paris so he can complain to M. de Tr\u00e9ville.<PARAGRAPH>Once in Paris, D\u2019Artagnan sells off his horse (so much for listening to his old man!), rents a tiny garret, and falls asleep perfectly happy with his previous conduct.<PARAGRAPH>The next day he plans to see M. de Tr\u00e9ville.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112556/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-one-the-three-presents-of-dartagnan-the-elder"}
