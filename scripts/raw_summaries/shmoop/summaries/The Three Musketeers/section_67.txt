{"name": "Chapter Sixty-Seven: Conclusion", "summary": "The King is finally obliged to return to La Rochelle. His vacation in Paris is over. He sets off still astonished over the death of Buckingham, and he gloats about it to his wife.<PARAGRAPH>As the four friends escort the King, they just look sad. All the time.<PARAGRAPH>One day the four friends have stopped for drinks at an inn when a man walks in and spots D\u2019Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan grabs his sword: it\u2019s the Man from Meung!<PARAGRAPH>The man explains he is there to arrest D\u2019Artagnan. He announces himself as the Chevalier de Rochefort, under orders to take D\u2019Artagnan to the Cardinal.<PARAGRAPH>Athos points out that they are on their way to La Rochelle, and D\u2019Artagnan promises to go straight to the Cardinal when he arrives.<PARAGRAPH>Rochefort says that isn\u2019t good enough.<PARAGRAPH>Athos pledges that he, Porthos, and Aramis will act as guards and make sure that D\u2019Artagnan never leaves their side.<PARAGRAPH>Rochefort understands that it would come down to a fight with him against four men, and acquiesces to this plan, providing D\u2019Artagnan surrender his sword.<PARAGRAPH>Rochefort says this works well since he can now continue his journey. Athos says if Rochefort is journeying in search of Milady, it\u2019s a useless journey.<PARAGRAPH>Rochefort asks what happened; Athos tells him to return to camp and find out.<PARAGRAPH>The King meets up with the Cardinal at Surg\u00e8res. The Cardinal finds D\u2019Artagnan with his three (well-armed) friends, and beckons D\u2019Artagnan to go with him.<PARAGRAPH>Athos calls out that they (Porthos, Aramis, Athos) will wait for him.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is convinced he is going to receive a death sentence.<PARAGRAPH>The Cardinal says D\u2019Artagnan has been arrested. D\u2019Artagnan argues that he\u2019s only guilty of one thing, and there\u2019s no way the Cardinal could have known about it.<PARAGRAPH>The Cardinal lists D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s crimes, and D\u2019Artagnan wants to know who accuses him. D\u2019Artagnan then lists the crimes of his accuser (Milady). The Cardinal says that if the crimes are true, she will be punished.<PARAGRAPH>Too late, D\u2019Artagnan says. She\u2019s already dead.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan fills the Cardinal in on all the murdering and executing that\u2019s been going on.<PARAGRAPH>The Cardinal eventually relaxes. He asks if D\u2019Artagnan and his friends realize that, by judging without a license to do so, they are considered assassins.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan says he is willing to accept any punishment the Cardinal wants to dole out.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan mentions that he has the Cardinal\u2019s pardon in his pocket, but that he\u2019s nevertheless ready to be sentenced however the Cardinal sees fit.<PARAGRAPH>The Cardinal asks to see the pardon. He then reflects.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is positive he is going to die.<PARAGRAPH>Cardinal Richelieu continues thinking. He weighs D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s youth, devotion, and bravery against Milady\u2019s admittedly terrifying exploits.<PARAGRAPH>He hands D\u2019Artagnan a piece of paper: it is a lieutenant\u2019s commission in the Musketeers! D\u2019Artagnan falls at the Cardinal\u2019s feet and says he cannot accept it\u2014his friends, he says, are more worthy.<PARAGRAPH>The Cardinal points out that the name on the commission is blank. D\u2019Artagnan can give it to any one of his friends if he so desires. The Cardinal wants D\u2019Artagnan to remember, however, that the commission was given to him.<PARAGRAPH>The Cardinal calls for Rochefort and has him and D\u2019Artagnan put their differences behind them.<PARAGRAPH>The two men leave and make arrangements to have a duel, at some point in the future.<PARAGRAPH>Later that night, D\u2019Artagnan goes straight to Athos and offers him the commission. Athos responds that D\u2019Artagnan ought to keep it; for the Comte de la F\u00e8re it is too little, for Athos it is too much.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan next goes to visit Porthos, who refuses the commission. He\u2019s getting married to his recently widowed mistress.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan then goes in search of Aramis, who also refuses. He is determined to become a priest.<PARAGRAPH>Our young hero then returns to Athos, who writes in D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s name, saying that none is more worthy.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is not happy\u2014he no longer has friends!<PARAGRAPH>Athos tells him that feeling isolated is a product of youth. Over time, D\u2019Artagnan will feel better.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112556/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-sixty-seven-conclusion"}
