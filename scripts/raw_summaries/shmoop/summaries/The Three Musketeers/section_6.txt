{"name": "Chapter Six: His Majesty King Louis XIII", "summary": "Tr\u00e9ville pretends to be very ashamed of his Musketeers in public, but he congratulates them in private. It\u2019s important that he tell the King his version of events, so that evening he heads to the Louvre. (Today the Louvre is a museum, but it was once a royal palace.)<PARAGRAPH>That evening, the King is gambling. And winning, so he\u2019s happy. He spies Tr\u00e9ville and tells him to start controlling his crazy Musketeers.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville pretends to be surprised, and claims that his Musketeers are gentle creatures devoted to the King. He claims that the Cardinal\u2019s guards are the ones at fault.<PARAGRAPH>Further conversation between the two is delayed until the King starts losing.<PARAGRAPH>He tells someone to sub in for him and then goes off to chat with Tr\u00e9ville.<PARAGRAPH>The King asks Tr\u00e9ville for his version of the day\u2019s events. Tr\u00e9ville tells the King that three of his Musketeers were going to hang out with a young Gascon when they were interrupted by five Guardsmen who were clearly in the area to fight some duels. He doesn\u2019t outright accuse the guards of being there to fight duels, but the implication is clear, and the King, bright man that he is, seizes upon it.<PARAGRAPH>Periodically, Tr\u00e9ville flatters the King.<PARAGRAPH>Since the Musketeers and D\u2019Artagnan won, Tr\u00e9ville is perfectly at liberty to point out that one of the men was wounded and that D\u2019Artagnan is basically a boy.<PARAGRAPH>The King is pumped to have scored such a decisive victory over the Cardinal\u2019s men. Tr\u00e9ville takes the opportunity to recommend D\u2019Artagnan to the King.<PARAGRAPH>The King asks for the full story behind D\u2019Artagnan and is impressed to learn that the Gascon was able to injure Jussac, who is considered to be one of France\u2019s finest swordsmen.<PARAGRAPH>The King consents to meeting D\u2019Artagnan tomorrow at noon, and instructs Tr\u00e9ville to bring all four together. He also tells them to come by the back stairs so the Cardinal doesn\u2019t know.<PARAGRAPH>That night, the Musketeers aren\u2019t too impressed about the summons because they\u2019ve met the King a few times, but D\u2019Artagnan is excited.<PARAGRAPH>At eight the next morning, D\u2019Artagnan shows up at Athos\u2019s house. Athos had agreed to meet Porthos and Aramis for tennis. D\u2019Artagnan, having nothing else to do, tags along.<PARAGRAPH>Athos tries to play but he\u2019s still too wounded. D\u2019Artagnan doesn\u2019t know how to play tennis, but makes himself useful as a ball boy.<PARAGRAPH>When one of the balls almost smacks him in the face, D\u2019Artagnan decides that it\u2019s too risky to involve himself in the game since he wants his to look good for the King. He extricates himself from the courts.<PARAGRAPH>Unfortunately, one of the Guardsmen is watching, and he makes a snarky comment to D\u2019Artagnan along the lines of, \"You\u2019re afraid of tennis balls.\"<PARAGRAPH>Bad move.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan demands a retraction, which the Guardsman does not give.<PARAGRAPH>They decide to fight.<PARAGRAPH>The man\u2019s name is Bernajoux. The two exit the court. (Side note: Bernajoux is shocked that D\u2019Artagnan isn\u2019t scared of his name.)<PARAGRAPH>Bernajoux wants to find a more private place in which to duel (remember, dueling is illegal!) but D\u2019Artagnan says that he\u2019s in a hurry so they need to just fight in the street.<PARAGRAPH>The two start fighting. D\u2019Artagnan scores a hit on Bernajoux\u2019s shoulder and immediately gives him the chance to stop fighting. Bernajoux cries out that the wound doesn\u2019t matter and rushes forward\u2026 right onto D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s sword.<PARAGRAPH>Rather than surrender, however, he rushes over to the hotel of M. de la Tr\u00e9mouille. D\u2019Artagnan, unaware of the severity of his opponent\u2019s injuries, rushes after him, but is stopped by two of Bernajoux\u2019s friends, who rush out from the tennis court.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos, Aramis, and Athos also then show up, making the fight two against four. The Guardsmen call on the hotel de la Tr\u00e9mouille for help. All the servants of the hotel rush out to aid the Guardsmen. On their end, the Musketeers start shouting for help, and various soldiers of other companies run to their aid.<PARAGRAPH>Pandemonium and lots of great sword fights ensue.<PARAGRAPH>The Musketeers are in a better position, and so the Cardinal\u2019s supporters quickly withdraw into the hotel. Bernajoux is already inside receiving medical attention for his critical wounds.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone left outside debates setting fire to the hotel to punish the servants for daring to fight Musketeers.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan and his buddies remember, however, that they have an important appointment. They calm everyone down and head out to Tr\u00e9ville\u2019s hotel, where the man himself is already waiting for them. He\u2019s heard the latest news and wants to get to the King as soon as possible before the Cardinal tells his version of events. Tr\u00e9ville plans to pass off yesterday and today\u2019s events with one simple story.<PARAGRAPH>When they reach the palace, a servant tells Tr\u00e9ville that the King is out hunting.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville finds out that the King and the Cardinal have already interacted, and then advises his men to simply go home and wait for news.<PARAGRAPH>After getting back to his hotel, Tr\u00e9ville sends a servant to M. de la Tr\u00e9mouille with a message requesting that he kick out all the Cardinal\u2019s Guardsmen. The message also says something to the effect of, how dare your men try to mess with the King\u2019s Musketeers?<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9mouille sends a message back saying that the Musketeers started the fight. He\u2019s prejudiced because one of his men is related to Bernajoux.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville realizes that the servants are going to get very tired if they have to keep running back and forth between Tr\u00e9ville and Tr\u00e9mouille, and decides to end this foolishness by confronting Tr\u00e9mouille face-to-face.<PARAGRAPH>When Tr\u00e9ville shows up, Tr\u00e9mouille continues to maintain that the whole fight was the fault of the Musketeers.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville proposes that they let Bernajoux tell the full story. He\u2019s badly wounded, but the man can still talk.<PARAGRAPH>Since this proposal is so fair and just, Tr\u00e9mouille agrees.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville lets Tr\u00e9mouille do the questioning. Bernajoux tells the whole truth. Tr\u00e9ville, happy to hear it, takes off and sends for Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and D\u2019Artagnan to join him at lunch.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan turns out to be the guest of honor as everyone congratulates him on his mad fighting skills.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Tr\u00e9ville announces that it\u2019s time for them to pay a visit to the King. They wait in the King\u2019s antechamber with other nobles who are eager to say hi and ask for a favor.<PARAGRAPH>After some time, the King finally returns from his hunting trip.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s not happy. He didn\u2019t catch anything.<PARAGRAPH>All the nobles still press forward and try to be seen by the King. The three Musketeers do the same, but D\u2019Artagnan is too intimidated by his first real, actual brush with royalty.<PARAGRAPH>(It doesn\u2019t matter anyway since the King ignores them all on his way to his bedroom.)<PARAGRAPH>Athos has a dismal outlook on the situation. Tr\u00e9ville tells him to be patient. If Tr\u00e9ville doesn\u2019t come out in ten minutes, his men are to return to the hotel.<PARAGRAPH>The four men wait twenty minutes before leaving.<PARAGRAPH>When Tr\u00e9ville enters the King\u2019s room, the King complains of boredom and disappointment with the day\u2019s hunt.<PARAGRAPH>The King starts chastising Tr\u00e9ville again for the behavior of the Musketeers.<PARAGRAPH>His Majesty finds it hard to believe that the Musketeers weren\u2019t being reckless earlier. He tells Tr\u00e9ville to prove that Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D\u2019Artagnan did not unfairly ambush Bernajoux and then try to burn Tr\u00e9mouille\u2019s hotel.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville asks the King where he\u2019s getting this information. The King then talks about some guy who watches over him when he sleeps and handles all his affairs.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s clearly talking about the Cardinal, but Tr\u00e9ville asks if the King is possibly referring to God, because He\u2019s the only guy who could possibly be higher than the King.<PARAGRAPH>The King gently corrects Tr\u00e9ville and explicitly refers to the Cardinal as the source of information.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville retorts by pointing out that Cardinals are not immune from error.<PARAGRAPH>The King tells Tr\u00e9ville that the real source of information is the Duke, Monsieur de la Tr\u00e9mouille.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville requests that the King question the Duke alone with no witnesses, and that he (Tr\u00e9ville) get to see the King right after the interview.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville agrees to stand by Tr\u00e9mouille\u2019s testimony.<PARAGRAPH>The King sends a servant to find Monsieur de la Tr\u00e9mouille.<PARAGRAPH>The two men say their good-byes; Tr\u00e9ville has a sleepless night. He meets up with the Musketeers and D\u2019Artagnan at six-thirty in the morning and the five of them go anxiously to see the King.<PARAGRAPH>Soon they see Tr\u00e9mouille coming out of the King\u2019s room. Tr\u00e9mouille goes straight up to Tr\u00e9ville and apologizes. He has told the King the truth of what happened\u2014that it was all the fault of his men. Tr\u00e9ville replies in a very kind, gentleman-like way.<PARAGRAPH>The King overhears the whole conversation and compliments the two of them.<PARAGRAPH>More compliments.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, the King asks to see the Musketeers (and D\u2019Artagnan).<PARAGRAPH>The King begins to scold them. They have, after all, incapacitated seven of the Cardinal\u2019s guards in two days. In the King\u2019s opinion, that\u2019s way too much fighting.<PARAGRAPH>The King then asks D\u2019Artagnan to come closer, proclaiming him a mere boy and not quite a man. The King is astonished D\u2019Artagnan was the one to have debilitated Jussac and Bernajoux.<PARAGRAPH>Athos notes that D\u2019Artagnan saved his life.<PARAGRAPH>The King, very impressed, says that a lot of equipment must have been damaged in the course of all this sword fighting. He then asks if Gascons are always poor.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville says no, but points out that the King owes his position to the loyalty of Gascons.<PARAGRAPH>The King dispatches his servant to get forty pistoles. We have no idea how much money that is, but we\u2019ll probably find out soon.<PARAGRAPH>While the servant goes hunting for some spare money, the King asks D\u2019Artagnan for his life story.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan tells everything, and it all jives with Tr\u00e9mouille\u2019s testimony.<PARAGRAPH>The King asks the men to stop with all the fighting, because they\u2019ve done quite enough. Then he hands over the gold.<PARAGRAPH>Dumas then tells his readers that there was no shame in accepting money those days. The money is split evenly between the four adventurers.<PARAGRAPH>The King then dismisses the men.<PARAGRAPH>As everyone clears out, the King suggests to Tr\u00e9ville that he place D\u2019Artagnan with the Guards of Monsieur Dessessart (who happens to be Tr\u00e9ville\u2019s brother-in-law). It would be bad form for D\u2019Artagnan to be accepted straight away into the Musketeers.<PARAGRAPH>The King is really pleased that he can be fake and snarky around the Cardinal now. For example, he asks the Cardinal constantly how Jussac and Bernajoux are doing.<PARAGRAPH>Yes, this is kind of like two guys playing a \"mine is bigger than yours\" contest, except it\u2019s more along the lines of \"my soldiers can beat up your soldiers.\"", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112556/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-six-his-majesty-king-louis-xiii"}
