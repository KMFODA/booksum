{"name": "Chapter Five: The King\u2019s Musketeers and the Cardinal\u2019s Guards", "summary": "Historical Context Lesson: When dueling, you always bring along a \"second.\" This person is someone you trust enough to witness the fight, ensure that it\u2019s fair, and call for a doctor in case you start bleeding.<PARAGRAPH>Being a newbie in town, D\u2019Artagnan has no one he can ask to serve as his second. On his way to meet Athos, he comes up with a game plan for his upcoming fights. He decides to befriend Athos, frighten Porthos, and, as for Aramis, he figures he\u2019ll probably be dead by two o\u2019clock so he doesn\u2019t have to come up with a plan of action. But if he is alive, he decides to just slap Aramis in the face.<PARAGRAPH>He takes heart when he thinks of his father and runs to meet Athos.<PARAGRAPH>Athos is already waiting. He tells D\u2019Artagnan that his two seconds are late.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan confesses that he has no seconds, and that he doesn\u2019t even know anyone in Paris except for Tr\u00e9ville.<PARAGRAPH>Athos, talking out loud, says that if he kills D\u2019Artagnan, he\u2019s going to be known as a \"boy-slayer.\" That\u2019s definitely some bad press.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan disagrees. After all, Athos is still wounded.<PARAGRAPH>Athos warns D\u2019Artagnan that he can swordfight with either hand.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan thanks Athos for the information.<PARAGRAPH>Athos complains about his shoulder and D\u2019Artagnan offers his mother\u2019s remedy, convinced that it will cure Athos\u2019s wound.<PARAGRAPH>There\u2019s more dialogue, and it basically boils down to this: D\u2019Artagnan impresses Athos.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Porthos appears.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is surprised.<PARAGRAPH>Then Aramis appears.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is even more surprised.<PARAGRAPH>Athos asks if D\u2019Artagnan has been living in a hole. The three are famous for being absolutely inseparable, cradle-to-grave-BFFs.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos comes up and asks what\u2019s going on.<PARAGRAPH>Athos points to D\u2019Artagnan as his adversary.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos rightfully says, \"But I\u2019m fighting him!\"<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan says, \"Not until one o\u2019clock!\"<PARAGRAPH>Aramis comes up and says, \"But I\u2019m also fighting him!\"<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan says, \"But not until two o\u2019clock!\"<PARAGRAPH>Aramis asks Athos for the cause of the fight.<PARAGRAPH>Athos says that he can\u2019t even remember, something about his shoulder getting hurt. He then asks Porthos for his reasons for fighting D\u2019Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>Not wanting to confess the real reason, Porthos evades the question.<PARAGRAPH>Athos sees D\u2019Artagnan smile as he (Athos) says they disagreed about fashion.<PARAGRAPH>Aramis says that their disagreement was about God, and signals D\u2019Artagnan to stay silent.<PARAGRAPH>Athos again observes that D\u2019Artagnan is hiding something, even as the Gascon says he and Aramis disagreed about a passage of St. Augustine.<PARAGRAPH>Athos grows more impressed by the second with D\u2019Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>Now that everyone is present, D\u2019Artagnan apologizes to all three men. They don\u2019t take it well. Rapidly, D\u2019Artagnan tells them they\u2019re misinterpreting him. He is apologizing just in case he doesn\u2019t make it to the one o\u2019clock and two o\u2019clock fights. Then he draws his sword.<PARAGRAPH>The two barely start fighting when the Cardinal\u2019s Guards show up, commanded by a man named Jussac.<PARAGRAPH>Aramis and Porthos yell for the combatants to sheath their swords, but it\u2019s too late. There\u2019s clearly a duel going on, and Jussac calls them on it. (Remember, it\u2019s illegal to duel. Not that that stops anyone.)<PARAGRAPH>Jussac attempts to arrest them. Aramis \"regretfully\" declines. Jussac threatens a fight.<PARAGRAPH>The Musketeers take a knee so they can map out a game plan. Athos points out that it\u2019s three against five, and that the three of them are probably going to die, since he really, really doesn\u2019t want to lose again.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan pipes up and says, \"Heyo! What about me? There\u2019s four of us!\"<PARAGRAPH>Porthos points out that D\u2019Artagnan hardly counts as a Musketeer. Or a friend.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan offers ye olde underdog excuse: that he has heart. Even though he isn\u2019t a Musketeer, he says, he has the proper spirit.<PARAGRAPH>Jussac tells D\u2019Artagnan to beat it; the Guards will let him go.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, the three Musketeers feel kind of upset because D\u2019Artagnan is still a boy.<PARAGRAPH>Athos points out that when they lose, the story will be told as if it was four of them, instead of two men, a wounded man, and a boy.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan asks again if he can fight.<PARAGRAPH>Athos asks for his name. D\u2019Artagnan gives it, and the four of them press forward to fight the Cardinal\u2019s guards.<PARAGRAPH>(Mind you, this all takes place in the most polite ways.)<PARAGRAPH>Finally, we get a swordfight!<PARAGRAPH>Being the hot-headed young man he is, D\u2019Artagnan charges straight for Jussac. Aramis fights two at once, and the other two Musketeers have one adversary each.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan fights like \"a furious tiger\" and his street-fighting style gives him an edge over Jussac, who is a great swordsman in his own right.<PARAGRAPH>Frustrated, Jussac finally begins making mistakes. He thrusts at D\u2019Artagnan, who blocks the blow and then spears Jussac, who falls \"like a dead mass.\"<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan then looks around to see how the Musketeers are doing.<PARAGRAPH>Aramis has killed one of his opponents and is engaged with the other one. Porthos and his adversary each have minor wounds and are still going at it.<PARAGRAPH>Athos is wounded once more by his opponent (named Cahusac) and is now fighting with his left hand. He looks over at D\u2019Artagnan in a clear \"I\u2019m a man so I\u2019m not actually asking for help but I would seriously appreciate it\" kind of way.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan runs over to engage Cahusac. Athos sinks down to the ground for a much-needed rest, then tells D\u2019Artagnan to only disarm Cahusac because he wants the honor of actually killing the Guard.<PARAGRAPH>Momentarily, D\u2019Artagnan succeeds in disarming Cahusac. The man runs to retrieve his sword, but D\u2019Artagnan beats him to it.<PARAGRAPH>Cahusac runs to the dead Guard (the one killed by Aramis) and grabs his sword. On his way back to D\u2019Artagnan, he runs into Athos, who is now ready to fight again.<PARAGRAPH>Athos and D\u2019Artagnan together fight Cahusac, who soon dies.<PARAGRAPH>At the same moment, Aramis forces his opponent to yield.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos continues to fight his adversary (with a lot of trash talk thrown in for good measure). The man\u2019s name is Bicarat.<PARAGRAPH>(The men really need to wrap it up, however. Remember, dueling is illegal. Everyone is in danger of getting arrested!)<PARAGRAPH>Athos, Aramis, and D\u2019Artagnan surround Bicarat and tell him to quit.<PARAGRAPH>Bicarat wants to keep fighting, even as Jussac yells at him to stop. Finally, Jussac commands him to stop.<PARAGRAPH>Magic words! Bicarat immediately stops and then breaks his sword over his knee so that he won\u2019t have to surrender it.<PARAGRAPH>The Musketeers and D\u2019Artagnan salute Bicarat for his bravery, and then take the wounded to the convent. They leave the dead guy.<PARAGRAPH>The Musketeers and D\u2019Artagnan then go visit Tr\u00e9ville, but it turns into a bit of a parade as they relate the story to every Musketeer they pass.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is overjoyed to be hanging out with three such awesome men. He\u2019s hopeful that he can one day be a Musketeer just like them.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112556/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-five-the-kings-musketeers-and-the-cardinals-guards"}
