{"name": "Chapter Ten: A Mousetrap in the Seventeenth Century", "summary": "The narrator gives the definition of a mousetrap. When someone is arrested, the Guards keep it a secret and lie in wait. When unsuspecting people visit the man who was arrested, they\u2019re grabbed and held for interrogation.<PARAGRAPH>After two or three days, the Guards have everyone who associates with the prisoner.<PARAGRAPH>Bonacieux\u2019s apartment becomes a mousetrap and all the visitors are held for questioning.<PARAGRAPH>Since D\u2019Artagnan lives above Bonacieux\u2019s apartment and has his own entrance, his visitors avoid the trap.<PARAGRAPH>No one visits D\u2019Artagnan anyway except for the three Musketeers, who are busy trying to obtain information on Madame Bonacieux\u2019s abduction.<PARAGRAPH>Athos even asked Tr\u00e9ville for information, but Tr\u00e9ville has nothing to report except that the Cardinal has been looking thoughtful, the King uncomfortable, and the Queen sad. Apparently the Queen\u2019s sadness is old news\u2014she is unhappy in her marriage.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan stays in his apartment all day, observing all the visitors being caught and listening to all the interrogations being held in Bonacieux\u2019s apartment.<PARAGRAPH>The guards always ask the same questions, trying to determine if Madame Bonacieux has asked anyone to deliver packages.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan, being the clever hero of the story that he is, determines that the Guards currently have no information, but that they want to know if the Duke of Buckingham is in Paris and whether or not he\u2019s going to meet up with the Queen<PARAGRAPH>The mousetrap continues.<PARAGRAPH>Shortly thereafter, another person is taken into the mousetrap. D\u2019Artagnan gets in position to listen to the subsequent conversation.<PARAGRAPH>There is no questioning, only a lot of struggling.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan determines that the Guards have caught a woman and are using bodily force to restrain her.<PARAGRAPH>Being a gentleman, D\u2019Artagnan can barely contain himself from flying downstairs to fight the assailants.<PARAGRAPH>The woman turns out to be Madame Bonacieux and the Guards prepare to drag her away. D\u2019Artagnan grabs his sword and yells for Planchet. He instructs his servant to find Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. They are to bring their swords to D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s apartment.<PARAGRAPH>Planchet asks where D\u2019Artagnan is going, and worries that his master will be killed running after the guards.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan sneaks down to the ground floor and knocks on Bonacieux\u2019s door. He is caught in the mousetrap.<PARAGRAPH>The neighbors hear variations on \"POW\" and \"CLANG\".<PARAGRAPH>Four men fly out of the house. D\u2019Artagnan remains as the clear victor. Yeah, D\u2019Artagnan!<PARAGRAPH>(This sounds cooler than it is, since only one of the men had a sword.)<PARAGRAPH>Still, the beautiful Madame Bonacieux is tr\u00e8s grateful.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator notes that Madame Bonacieux\u2019s hands and feet betray her as a member of the lower ranks, but D\u2019Artagnan isn\u2019t up on these standards. He\u2019s rapidly falling for her.<PARAGRAPH>He fills her in on the latest\u2014the Cardinal\u2019s men are after her, her husband is in the Bastille, etc. He also manages to throw in a compliment to her looks.<PARAGRAPH>It turns out Madame Bonacieux had escaped her captors and ran home in order to tell her husband a secret.<PARAGRAPH>Naturally D\u2019Artagnan asks to be told this secret. Madame Bonacieux says, no, it\u2019s my secret.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan then suggests that they get out of there since the Bonacieux home is quite popular with the Cardinal\u2019s guards.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Bonacieux agrees and the two of them flee.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan asks Madame Bonacieux what she had planned to do. She says she wanted to contact her godfather Monsieur Laporte to find out what\u2019s been going down in the palace.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan points out that he can go to inform Monsieur Laporte.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Bonacieux argues that D\u2019Artagnan is unknown at the palace and would be unable to enter. D\u2019Artagnan pushes the issue, arguing that Madame Bonacieux probably knows someone who knows someone.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Bonaceiux agrees after D\u2019Artagnan agrees to forget the passwords that she will give him.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan then leaves Madame Bonacieux at Athos\u2019s house for safekeeping. They arrange to signal when D\u2019Artagnan returns.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Bonacieux then gives D\u2019Artagnan instructions for his trip to the palace.<PARAGRAPH>Everything happens as Madame Bonacieux says. Monsieur Laporte then takes off to meet up with Madame Bonacieux. Before he leaves, however, he suggests that D\u2019Artagnan figure out a suitable alibi.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan heads to Tr\u00e9ville\u2019s house. He goes straight to Tr\u00e9ville\u2019s office, asks to see the commander. While he waits for Tr\u00e9ville to show, D\u2019Artagnan changes the clock back by three-quarters of an hour, and then conveniently points out the time\u2014five minutes before 9:30.<PARAGRAPH>Then he babbles on to Tr\u00e9ville about the Queen, and leaves when the clock strikes ten.<PARAGRAPH>Before he goes home, he runs back to the room and changes the clock back to the correct time.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112556/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-ten-a-mousetrap-in-the-seventeenth-century"}
