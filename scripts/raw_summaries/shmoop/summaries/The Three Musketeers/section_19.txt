{"name": "Chapter Nineteen: Plan of Campaign", "summary": "D\u2019Artagnan shows up at Tr\u00e9ville\u2019s house all excited. He\u2019s about to embark on a mission for glory, money, and love. What more could you want?<PARAGRAPH>As soon as Tr\u00e9ville sees D\u2019Artagnan, he can tell that something\u2019s up.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is ready to tell Tr\u00e9ville everything since he\u2019s such a good friend, but as soon as D\u2019Artagnan tells Tr\u00e9ville that the issue deals with the honor and the life of the Queen, Tr\u00e9ville tells him not to say a word, and then asks if he can do anything for D\u2019Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan asks for a fifteen-day leave of absence, to be enacted immediately.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville tells D\u2019Artagnan that if he leaves alone, he will be assassinated.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos, Aramis, and Athos are going to accompany D\u2019Artagnan. Tr\u00e9ville signs the orders under the pretense that the three Musketeers are going to the waters of Forges so that Athos can heal his wound.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville tells D\u2019Artagnan that the leaves of absence will be completed and signed by two in the morning. D\u2019Artagnan heads for Aramis\u2019s place. Aramis has been looking gloomy lately, and especially so tonight, but he says he\u2019s been writing an important religious piece. After the two chat for a few minutes, a servant shows up with a leave of absence for Aramis, who is properly shocked because he doesn\u2019t recall asking for one.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan realizes that Aramis is still pining for the woman with the embroidered handkerchief who helped the Duke of Buckingham meet up with the Queen (remember the woman in Tours?).<PARAGRAPH>It turns out Aramis has been feeling rejected, but D\u2019Artagnan tells him that, a) the woman went back to Tours because she didn\u2019t want to be arrested, and b) she didn\u2019t write to Aramis because she didn\u2019t want him to get arrested. Glad that\u2019s all sorted out; Aramis is perfectly happy to go to England with D\u2019Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>Along with Aramis\u2019s servant Bazin, they head to Athos\u2019s house.<PARAGRAPH>On their way D\u2019Artagnan assures Aramis that no one else knows about the lady.<PARAGRAPH>When they arrive at Athos\u2019s house, they find him holding his leave of absence and looking confused.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan explains that Athos is to follow him in service of the King and Queen.<PARAGRAPH>Porthos shows up, also confused about his leave of absence.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan explains that the whole gang is going to London. And then he pulls out the three hundred pistoles and says that everyone gets seventy-five each. He then also points out that not all of them are going to make it, which sounds vaguely ominous.<PARAGRAPH>Athos, Porthos, and Aramis say that they still don\u2019t know what this cause worth dying for is, exactly.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan asks if the King ever needs to give a reason.<PARAGRAPH>And then they say, good point!<PARAGRAPH>The four men call for their servants and tell them to prepare for the journey.<PARAGRAPH>They talk about how to proceed, and settle on traveling together. If D\u2019Artagnan is killed, someone else will carry the letter. If that person is killed, then someone else will carry the letter and so on until they\u2019re all dead or the letter has reached Buckingham.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone agrees to the plan and they set off.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112556/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-nineteen-plan-of-campaign"}
