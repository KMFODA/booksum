It is now three o\u2019clock in the morning.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan runs back to his apartment (where Planchet has returned from London), and asks if anyone has brought a letter.<PARAGRAPH>Planchet says no, but that a letter has mysteriously appeared. He found a letter in D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s bedroom and left it untouched. He thinks it\u2019s unnatural and warns D\u2019Artagnan that it is evil.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan rushes over and opens the letter.<PARAGRAPH>It tells D\u2019Artagnan to go to a pavilion in St. Cloud at ten o\u2019clock.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan is overcome with joy, but Planchet gets worried.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan gives Planchet some money. It doesn\u2019t appease Planchet, however, because he still wants to know where the letter came from and what it said.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan says it came from heaven.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan goes to bed snuggling his letter.<PARAGRAPH>At seven in the morning, D\u2019Artagnan leaves the house and tells Planchet that he will return at seven in the evening and he expects two horses to be ready.<PARAGRAPH>Planchet is not happy; he is convinced they\u2019re about to go off on another dangerous adventure.<PARAGRAPH>The two argue some more, and D\u2019Artagnan wins by questioning Planchet\u2019s manliness.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan leaves, but on his way out bumps into Monsieur Bonacieux.<PARAGRAPH>They start talking about Bonacieux\u2019s brief stint in jail. Bonacieux then asks where D\u2019Artagnan has been the past few days, and D\u2019Artagnan replies that he has been on a journey with his friends. D\u2019Artagnan tells his landlord not to worry if he stays out all night. Bonacieux turns pale and tries to excuse his violent reaction. He then tells D\u2019Artagnan that his wife is spending the night at the palace.<PARAGRAPH>The two finally part, D\u2019Artagnan having failed to notice during their conversation that Bonacieux may have been up to something.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan visits Tr\u00e9ville and discusses the previous night. The Cardinal had been really angry and had left early, but the King and Queen had danced until six in the morning.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville then inquires into D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s well being. He warns D\u2019Artagnan that the Cardinal is angry and wants to know who thwarted his plan of embarrassing the Queen.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville notices D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s diamond ring; D\u2019Artagnan explains that the ring is from the Queen.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville advises him to sell it. He warns D\u2019Artagnan that the ring will give him away\u2014he has to be on his guard.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan asks if he should look out for anything in particular, but Tr\u00e9ville says that the Cardinal has all sorts of tricks up his sleeve. He tells D\u2019Artagnan that the least he can expect is arrest. Finally Tr\u00e9ville tells D\u2019Artagnan to trust no one\u2014especially his mistress.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan blushes.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville says that the Cardinal\u2019s favorite means of bringing down a man is through a beautiful woman. D\u2019Artagnan thinks of Madame Bonacieux but does not suspect her at all.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville changes the subject and asks how D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s three friends are doing. D\u2019Artagnan has no idea. (To recap: Porthos was last seen fighting a duel at Chantilly, Aramis was left recuperating at Cr\u00e8vecoeur, and Athos had to fight accusations of forgery at Amiens.)<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan himself only barely escaped by fighting the Comte de Wardes. Tr\u00e9ville notes that De Wardes is Rochefort\u2019s cousin and one of the Cardinal\u2019s men.<PARAGRAPH>Tr\u00e9ville suggests that D\u2019Artagnan seek out his three friends.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan says he will leave tomorrow, which immediately rouses Tr\u00e9ville\u2019s suspicion, and he again cautions D\u2019Artagnan to be wary of women.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan leaves Tr\u00e9ville feeling touched by the man\u2019s concern.<PARAGRAPH>He visits each of his friends\u2019 homes, but there is no new information. D\u2019Artagnan then finds Planchet grooming the horses. Planchet asks his master if he trusts Monsieur Bonacieux, and notes that D\u2019Artagnan changed color several times throughout the course of their conversation. Planchet says that Bonacieux left right after D\u2019Artagnan, only heading in the opposite direction.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan refuses to Planchet\u2019s warnings seriously, and is determined to keep his ten o\u2019clock appointment.<PARAGRAPH>He instructs Planchet to be ready by nine o\u2019clock.<PARAGRAPH>D\u2019Artagnan, being cautious, visits a Gascon priest for dinner instead of returning home.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112556/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-twenty-three-the-rendezvous"}
