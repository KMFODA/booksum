{"name": "Chapter 6", "summary": "Catherine and Isabella have known each other around ten days. They meet in the Pump-room, Bath's best hot-spot, for some gossip.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella gripes that Catherine kept her waiting forever. Catherine thought she made good time.<PARAGRAPH>The two discuss reading Anne Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho.  Catherine is reading it for the first time and is spoiler-free, so Isabella won't tell her plot points.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine says that she would spend her entire life reading Udolpho, except she wanted to see Isabella, so she tore herself away.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella gives Catherine a list of some of her favorite Gothic novels, thus ensuring that Catherine won't read anything particularly educational for at least a few months.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella switches topics and gossips about her friend Miss Andrews, who is not admired by men.

Mrs. Morland does read novels, but not the Gothic ones that Isabella and Catherine enjoy.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella insists that she and Catherine dress the same for tonight's ball. She claims that men notice such things.<PARAGRAPH>After ragging on men in general for a bit, Isabella asks what type of guy Catherine finds attractive.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine flounders a bit and then settles on a guy with a bit of a tan. Isabella latches onto that and notes how that describes Henry Tilney.<PARAGRAPH>She then says that she herself likes fair complexions and then stops, saying she's giving too much away.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine is confused.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella says some men are bothering her and insists that she and Catherine move.<PARAGRAPH>The men depart soon after and Isabella now insists that she has to show Catherine a hat in a shop, so they take off in the direction the men walked.
