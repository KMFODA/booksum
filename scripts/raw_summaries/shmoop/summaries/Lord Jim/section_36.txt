{"name": "Chapter 37", "summary": "If you thought we were done with Marlow's storytelling, we hate to break it to you. We've got another round coming.<PARAGRAPH>In the letters, Marlow describes an encounter he has with a dying pirate named Gentleman Brown. According to Marlow, Brown's story will help fill in the gaps at the end of Jim's story.<PARAGRAPH>Marlow then jumps back in time (he has a nasty habit of doing that) to when he first learned of this story at Stein's house. He was there visiting Stein, and ran into Jewel and Tamb' Itam.<PARAGRAPH>Tamb' Itam said that Jim wouldn't fight, and Jewel woodenly said that Jim left her. We're not quite sure what they're talking about, but we have a bad feeling about this.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118112654/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/lord-jim/summary/chapter-37"}
