Instead of listening to Bel-Imperia's concerns, the lovers talk lovey-like.<PARAGRAPH>While they are busy smooching, Lorenzo, Balthazar, Serberine (a helpful henchman), and Pedringano (in disguise) enter the scene to get the drop on Horatio. They quickly hang Horatio from a tree, and as if being hanged wasn't enough, they repeatedly stab and mangle his body.<PARAGRAPH>Bel-Imperia witnesses the merciless slaughter, crying bloody murder at the top of her lungs all the while.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630080946/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-spanish-tragedy/summary/act-2-scene-4"}
