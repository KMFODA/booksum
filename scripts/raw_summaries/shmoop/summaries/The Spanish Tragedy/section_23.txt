But the duke obviously knows his son is a scoundrel, because he makes Lorenzo promise that he will never mistreat Hieronimo. This is important because we learn that the duke isn't in on the murders.<PARAGRAPH>Lorenzo tells his dad that rumormongers are hating on him, and that he was merely trying to keep Hieronimo from embarrassing himself.<PARAGRAPH>The duke tells Lorenzo to immediately squash his beef with the knight marshal. And then he sends for Hieronimo so the two can kiss and make up.<PARAGRAPH>Bel-Imperia and Balthazar conveniently enter the scene to give time for Hieronimo to come along.<PARAGRAPH>Balthazar is still trying to chat up Bel-Imperia as they enter, but the duke interrupts them to say that he forgives Bel-Imperia for ever dating Andrea\u2014gee thanks, dad.<PARAGRAPH>When Hieronimo shows up, the duke plays peacemaker between his son and the knight marshal.<PARAGRAPH>But Hieronimo isn't having it. He draws his sword and challenges Lorenzo to a fight.<PARAGRAPH>The duke begs Hieronimo to forgive his son, inviting him to be a guest at their house for the wedding.
