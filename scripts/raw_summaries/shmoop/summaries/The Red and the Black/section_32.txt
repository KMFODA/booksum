But he's not very good on a horse, so he soon falls off in the middle of the street.<PARAGRAPH>The family is impressed with how easily Julien tells the story of his fall.

The marquis comes in and banishes the other guy from the library. His name is Monsieur Tanbeau and he's a young man who's also employed by the marquis. But it's clear that this guy isn't going to get the special treatment that Julien is. This of course makes them enemies.<PARAGRAPH>Julien asks Norbert to take him riding again.

Norbert praises Julien's bravery at the de La Mole's dinner table that night.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, Father Pirard leaves to take up his new position at a nearby parish.
