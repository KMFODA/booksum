Their parents often don't remember this.<PARAGRAPH>In June Jim stops at the Harlings' to tell them that a dancing pavilion has come to town. Three Italian immigrants came to town and found a vacant lot to set up a tent for dancing. In the winter they work in Kansas City and in the summer they settle down in some farming town to teach dancing. Whenever business starts to slow down they just move on to another town.<PARAGRAPH>Soon after the tent is put up everyone starts sending their kids there to learn how to dance.

Her husband, Mr. Vanni, plays the harp for them.<PARAGRAPH>Many of the mothers come and watch their children learn how to dance.
