The servant says they've been trying other cabs, but \"there's something wrong with them all\" (37.3).<PARAGRAPH>After that, Mr. Briggs is back on the good customer list, although he never again asks for a Sunday ride.<PARAGRAPH>However, Jerry does go out once on a Sunday, which Beauty explains. One Sunday Polly comes to Jerry with the news that her friend Dinah Brown's mother is seriously ill, and Dinah \"[\u2026] must go directly if she wishes to see her alive\" (37.9). Problem is, Dinah's mother lives ten miles out of town, a long walk from any train station, plus Dinah has a four-week-old baby.<PARAGRAPH>Polly asks Jerry to go, quoting the Golden Rule at him\u2014\"you know we should do to other people as we should like they should do to us\" (37.11)\u2014so Jerry agrees, saying that Polly is \"as good as the Minister\" (37.12).<PARAGRAPH>They ride out of town to deliver Dinah on a beautiful May day.
