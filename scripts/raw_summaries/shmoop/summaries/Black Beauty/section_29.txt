Although at first everything's fine\u2014the groom \"kept the stable clean and airy [\u2026] groomed me thoroughly and was never otherwise than gentle\" (30.2)\u2014after a while Beauty thinks his food is coming up short. However, being a horse, Beauty can't say a word about this, and instead \"I wondered why my master did not see that something was the matter\" (30.2).<PARAGRAPH>One day when Beauty is out with his new master, a helpful passing gentlemen (we've seen a lot of those, haven't we?) stops them to remark on how unhealthy Beauty looks. He tells Beauty's master to look into the situation and check out things in the stable.<PARAGRAPH>Beauty relates his frustration at watching the groom and a little boy steal (or, you know, filch) the oats from his supply\u2014he knows what's been going on.
