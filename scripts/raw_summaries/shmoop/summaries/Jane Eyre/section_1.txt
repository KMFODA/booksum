{"name": "Volume 1, Chapter 2", "summary": "The nursemaid, Bessie, and Mrs. Reed\u2019s lady\u2019s-maid, Miss Abbot, physically drag Jane to the red room; she\u2019s fighting them the whole way, which, she tells us, is unusual for her, but she\u2019s half-crazed.<PARAGRAPH>Jane objects to John Reed being called her \"master,\" and Miss Abbot tells Jane that she is \"less than a servant\" because she doesn\u2019t even work or pay for her room and board. We think this is pretty harsh\u2014after all, she\u2019s ten, and the Reeds are rich.<PARAGRAPH>Bessie and Abbot plunk Jane down on a stool; they threaten to tie her down, but she promises to stay in place.<PARAGRAPH>The servants spend a few minutes reminding Jane again that she\u2019s just a poor orphan, that she ought to be grateful to her aunt for taking her in, and so on. They even claim that God will strike her down if she keeps having tantrums, and then they leave and lock her in.<PARAGRAPH>Jane tells us about the red room, which is a spare bedroom furnished in, you guessed it, red\u2014red curtains, red carpet, red tablecloth, reddish wood (mahogany) furniture\u2014although there are a few white things in it, too. It\u2019s cold, quiet, and lonely, and\u2026 here\u2019s the creepiest bit\u2026 it\u2019s the room in which her uncle, Mr. Reed, died (of natural causes).<PARAGRAPH>Jane gets up to make sure she\u2019s locked in\u2014yep, she is. Then she looks in the mirror, and the room looks even weirder in the mirror, especially because her reflection looks sort of like a ghost. Hint: this isn\u2019t the last time that Jane herself will seem almost supernatural.<PARAGRAPH>Jane thinks about how unfair her situation is\u2014she\u2019s bullied by her cousins, her aunt hates her for no reason, and even the servants are snotty to her. She knows that she\u2019s the best behaved of the four children, but everyone dislikes her and indulges the others, and this unfairness really bothers her. Her keen ethical sense is awakening!<PARAGRAPH>Jane the child, whom we\u2019re following in the story, can\u2019t understand why she\u2019s being mistreated, but Jane the adult, who is telling the story (see \"Narrator Point of View\"), can. It\u2019s not because she\u2019s poor, but because she\u2019s different than the Reeds\u2014different in temperament. Maybe, she thinks, it\u2019s also because Jane is only Mrs. Reed\u2019s niece by marriage; she was related to Mr. Reed, but she and Mrs. Reed aren\u2019t blood relatives.<PARAGRAPH>It\u2019s starting to get dark and the wind and rain are still raging outside\u2014Jane\u2019s beginning to freak out in this creepy red room.<PARAGRAPH>Jane decides that if Mr. Reed were here now, he would be nicer to her than his widow and children are\u2026 but then she starts to worry that he might come back from the grave to try to comfort her, and that would be creepy.<PARAGRAPH>Jane tries to calm down so that Mr. Reed\u2019s ghost doesn\u2019t appear to reassure her, but then she sees a weird streak of light. Where is it coming from? It\u2019s not the moon. Is it a lantern? Maybe. Is it a ghost? Eeek! Jane screams. Well, actually, she \"utter[s] a wild involuntary cry\" (1.2.32), but you get the idea.<PARAGRAPH>Bessie and Abbot come running and ask what\u2019s the matter. Bessie seems sympathetic when Jane tells her that she thought she saw a ghost\u2014she lets Jane hold her hand\u2014but Abbot thinks that Jane is just trying to trick them into letting her out.<PARAGRAPH>Next Mrs. Reed comes to see what all the noise was. Uh-oh. She\u2019s mad that the servants didn\u2019t obey her orders to leave Jane alone and, like Abbot, she thinks that Jane\u2019s being manipulative.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Reed punishes Jane with another hour alone in the red room, and as she leaves Jane faints.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210506211142/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/jane-eyre/summary/volume-1-chapter-2"}
