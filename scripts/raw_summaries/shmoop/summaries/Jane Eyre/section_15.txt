{"name": "Volume 2, Chapter 1", "summary": "Jane is convinced that Rochester will come and visit her and Ad\u00e8le in the schoolroom the next day, but he doesn\u2019t.<PARAGRAPH>She overhears the other servants talking\u2014they are under the impression that Rochester was sleeping with a lit candle beside his bed, woke up with the bed on fire, and put it out himself. None of them know about Jane\u2019s involvement or about the strange visit from someone on the third floor.<PARAGRAPH>When she passes Rochester\u2019s bedroom, Jane sees Grace Poole sitting beside the bed, sewing new curtains. She can\u2019t believe that Grace is just sitting there, behaving normally, and she questions the servant about the incident to trick her into betraying her guilt.<PARAGRAPH>Grace doesn\u2019t seem guilty, but she does seem to know something, and asks if Jane heard anything last night.<PARAGRAPH>Jane tells Grace about the eerie laugh, insisting that she wasn\u2019t dreaming. Grace asks if she saw anything, and Jane tells her that instead of looking outside, she locked her door\u2014which is true, although she went outside a little later.<PARAGRAPH>Grace advises Jane to keep her door locked every night, which Jane takes as either hypocrisy about safety, or a weird threat.<PARAGRAPH>Jane tries to figure out why Rochester has insisted that she keep the events of the night a secret, and what power Grace Poole could have over him to prevent him from having her arrested, or at least firing her, after she tried to murder him in his bed.<PARAGRAPH>She briefly speculates that perhaps Grace is Mr. Rochester\u2019s ex-lover, and that he has to do what she says so that she doesn\u2019t expose him, but she can\u2019t quite believe this: Grace is so plain-looking and matronly, almost ugly, and they just don\u2019t seem to be a match. Of course, Rochester seems to like Jane, and she\u2019s no looker, so maybe it could be true.<PARAGRAPH>Jane reminds herself that even if she\u2019s not pretty, she is ladylike, which Grace isn\u2019t, and then she trembles, remembering Rochester\u2019s behavior the night before. She\u2019s teaching Ad\u00e8le at the moment, and the girl notices her daydreaming.<PARAGRAPH>That evening, Jane expects Rochester to send for her so that they can talk further about the murder attempt, but when she goes downstairs to have tea with Mrs. Fairfax, she discovers that Rochester left right after breakfast to stay with some friends ten miles away at a house called \"the Leas.\" Mrs. Fairfax thinks he will stay there for a week.<PARAGRAPH>Jane\u2019s first question is whether there are any ladies at the Leas\u2014and there are several, including the local beauty, Blanche Ingram. Blanche, according to Mrs. Fairfax, is gorgeous and accomplished and sang duets with Mr. Rochester.<PARAGRAPH>Jane suggests to Mrs. Fairfax that Rochester might be interested in marrying Blanche Ingram. Mrs. Fairfax thinks the age difference is too much: Blanche is only twenty-five. Jane\u2019s about to push the issue, but Ad\u00e8le comes in and they have to start talking about something else.<PARAGRAPH>Later, alone in her room, Jane kicks herself for being such an idiot and thinking that Rochester would actually be interested in her.<PARAGRAPH>Jane decides that, the next day, she will make two sketches, one of herself with all her flaws, and one of a beautiful woman who fits the description Mrs. Fairfax gave of Blanche Ingram. Whenever she starts to think of Mr. Rochester fondly, she\u2019ll compare these two portraits, and remind herself that she can\u2019t compete with women like Blanche. Doesn\u2019t that sound healthy?<PARAGRAPH>The next morning, she spends an hour or two drawing her own portrait, and two weeks making one of her imagined version of Blanche.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210506211142/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/jane-eyre/summary/volume-2-chapter-1"}
