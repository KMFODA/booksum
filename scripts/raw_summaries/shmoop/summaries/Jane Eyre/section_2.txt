{"name": "Volume 1, Chapter 3", "summary": "Jane wakes up, confused and disoriented. Someone is holding her gently; she\u2019s never been held gently before.<PARAGRAPH>She starts to realize where she is\u2014in her own bed. Bessie and a gentleman are there, looking after her.<PARAGRAPH>Jane\u2019s glad to see the gentleman, because he\u2019s not one of the Reeds. She looks at him closely and realizes that she knows him. It\u2019s Mr. Lloyd, a local apothecary (sort of like a pharmacist\u2014he can give out prescriptions and medicines, but he doesn\u2019t have a doctor\u2019s training).<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lloyd gives Bessie instructions about looking after Jane and says he\u2019ll come back tomorrow, then leaves. Jane feels really depressed after he leaves; he\u2019s much nicer to her than anyone else who lives at Gateshead (Mrs. Reed\u2019s home).<PARAGRAPH>Bessie offers to get Jane something to eat or drink and is generally really nice to her. Jane\u2019s pretty confused by this kindness.<PARAGRAPH>Bessie goes into another room, and Jane overhears her ask the housemaid, Sarah, to sleep in the nursery because she\u2019s scared that Jane could die.<PARAGRAPH>Sarah and Bessie come back to sleep in the nursery; Jane listens as they whisper about strange figures and visions that were seen around Jane earlier\u2014something dressed in white, a black dog, lights, noises. They fall asleep, but Jane\u2019s wide awake in terror.<PARAGRAPH>Jane tells us that, even though she doesn\u2019t get sick after this shock, her nerves never really recover. She blames Mrs. Reed, even though she knows that maybe she shouldn\u2019t.<PARAGRAPH>When Jane gets up the next day, she sits by the fire wrapped in a shawl; the Reeds have gone out somewhere, Abbot is sewing, and Bessie\u2019s tidying up. Jane should be happy to be left alone for once, instead of bullied and tormented, but she can\u2019t stop crying silently to herself.<PARAGRAPH>Bessie brings Jane a treat\u2014a tart, and on a beautiful china plate that Jane\u2019s always liked. She can\u2019t bring herself to eat it.<PARAGRAPH>Next Bessie asks if Jane wants a book; she asks for Gulliver\u2019s Travels, which she\u2019s always loved (and thinks is nonfiction). But even reading can\u2019t comfort her now; Gulliver seems lonely and beset by terrible dangers.<PARAGRAPH>As she works, Bessie starts singing a song that Jane has always liked in the past. But this time\u2014can you guess?\u2014yep, it just sounds sad. We\u2019re starting to wonder if Jane will ever enjoy anything again.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lloyd comes to see how Jane is doing. She\u2019s not sick, and he starts trying to figure out why she\u2019s so miserable.<PARAGRAPH>Bessie tells Mr. Lloyd things that make Jane sound babyish: that she\u2019s crying because she didn\u2019t get to go out in the carriage with everyone else, and that she was sick because she had a fall. Jane\u2019s pretty indignant about these charges and denies them both\u2014and explains that the \"fall\" was actually when John Reed knocked her down.<PARAGRAPH>A bell rings and Bessie has to go have dinner with the other servants, so Mr. Lloyd is left alone with Jane.<PARAGRAPH>Jane tells Mr. Lloyd about the ghost, and he finds that pretty silly.<PARAGRAPH>Jane protests that she\u2019s miserable for lots of other reasons: she doesn\u2019t have any immediate family, Mrs. Reed and her son John are cruel to her, and she\u2019s made to feel that she doesn\u2019t have any right to live at Gateshead.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lloyd starts asking about different ways Jane could leave Gateshead. Does she have any other family? She\u2019s not sure, but she doesn\u2019t think so, and she wouldn\u2019t want to live with them if they were poor anyway. Could she go to school?<PARAGRAPH>Jane thinks about school. She\u2019s heard bad stuff about school from Bessie and John, but she doesn\u2019t really trust either of them, and she is interested in learning to paint and sing and sew and read French and stuff\u2014the things she knows young ladies get taught in school. Plus, she\u2019d be able to get away from the Reeds.<PARAGRAPH>Jane tells Mr. Lloyd that she does want to go to school, and he advises Mrs. Reed to send her to one.<PARAGRAPH>Jane hears Abbot tell Bessie that Mrs. Reed will send Jane to school, if only to get rid of her. Jane also hears Abbot talk about her (Jane\u2019s) own family: her dad was a poor clergyman (like a minister), her grandfather disinherited her mother for marrying him, and both of them (Jane\u2019s mom and dad) died while taking care of sick people during a typhus outbreak. Well, at least now she knows where she comes from.<PARAGRAPH>Bessie and Abbot agree that they would be able to feel sorry for Jane \"if she were a nice, pretty child\" (1.3.78) or \"a beauty like Miss Georgiana\" (1.3.79), but they can\u2019t really feel bad for her because she\u2019s unpleasant and ugly. We think they\u2019re jerks, especially for saying this in front of Jane. Hollywood movies may not show it, but you don\u2019t have to be stunningly gorgeous to suffer, you know.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210506211142/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/jane-eyre/summary/volume-1-chapter-3"}
