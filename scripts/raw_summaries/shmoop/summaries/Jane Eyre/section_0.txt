{"name": "Volume 1, Chapter 1", "summary": "Jane Eyre begins with the adult Jane looking back at her life. She jumps into the story at a moment in her childhood when she\u2019s ten years old.<PARAGRAPH>On this particular day, Jane and her cousins John, Eliza, and Georgiana aren\u2019t going to do something: they\u2019re not going to take a walk, because it\u2019s too wet. Jane is relieved; she hates walks, because it\u2019s depressing to realize that she\u2019s not as physically hardy as her cousins.<PARAGRAPH>Jane\u2019s cousins are \"clustered round their mama\" (1.1.3), but Jane\u2019s not allowed to join them, because her aunt, Mrs. Reed, and her nursemaid, Bessie, claim that she\u2019s been naughty. Jane has no idea what she\u2019s supposed to have done.<PARAGRAPH>Jane goes into the breakfast room, climbs up into the window seat, pulls the red velvet curtains around her (apparently the Reeds are pretty rich), and reads Bewick\u2019s History of British Birds, which is sort of like an illustrated field guide. She likes the pictures and the descriptions of icy landscapes\u2014maybe this penchant for arctic places is supposed to tell us something about her?<PARAGRAPH>Jane\u2019s cousin, John Reed, goes looking for her and, with the help of his sister Eliza, finds her in the window seat. We can tell that he\u2019s seriously bad news.<PARAGRAPH>Jane tells us a little bit about John Reed: he\u2019s fourteen, big, a greedy eater, pampered by his mom, doesn\u2019t really like his family, and especially hates Jane. He is, basically, a big fat bully.<PARAGRAPH>After a long pause, John smacks Jane really hard. He makes her show him which book she was reading, and then lords it over her that she\u2019s dependent on his family and tells her she can\u2019t read his books. Then he throws the book at her hard enough to knock her down, and she cuts her head on the door.<PARAGRAPH>Jane jumps up and tells John off, calling him \"wicked and cruel\" and \"like a murderer\" or \"like a slave driver\" or \"like the Roman emperors\" (1.1.33). He grabs her and they start fighting. Jane\u2019s not sure what she does, but she must hurt him somehow because she makes John holler.<PARAGRAPH>Eliza and Georgiana go and get their mother, Mrs. Reed, and the nursemaid Bessie, like the little tattletales they are.<PARAGRAPH>Jane\u2019s blamed for the fight, and Mrs. Reed orders that she be locked in \"the red room\" \u2026that doesn\u2019t sound sinister or anything, right?", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210506211142/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/jane-eyre/summary/volume-1-chapter-1"}
