{"name": "Volume 3, Chapter 4", "summary": "Jane continues to regain her strength living at Moor House. She\u2019s especially happy because, now that she\u2019s met Diana and Mary, she finally has some real friends of her own. The three women spend a lot of time together reading, talking, and walking on the moor. Diana starts teaching Jane German.<PARAGRAPH>Jane doesn\u2019t really develop a friendship with St. John. For one thing, he\u2019s not around a lot; he goes out visiting the sick and needy all the time, in all weathers. For another, he\u2019s a bit too reserved and cold to get friendly with her very fast.<PARAGRAPH>When Jane hears St. John preach, she\u2019s amazed at how powerful and intense he is, but also realizes that he\u2019s a really unhappy person.<PARAGRAPH>Diana and Mary prepare to move away and become governesses.<PARAGRAPH>Jane talks to St. John about the job he\u2019s promised to find for her. He says that he\u2019s been waiting until after his sisters leave to start their new jobs.<PARAGRAPH>St. John tells Jane about his family\u2019s poverty and warns her that he won\u2019t be able to get her a really great job, but he thinks she\u2019ll take what he found.<PARAGRAPH>St. John explains that he is the clergyman in the little town of Morton and that, when he came there two years ago, it didn\u2019t have a school. He established a boys\u2019 school and he\u2019s been meaning to establish a girls\u2019 school, too, funded by the rich factory owner in the town, Mr. Oliver. He asks Jane to run this school; she\u2019ll have a salary of thirty pounds a year (the same as at Thornfield!) and even a little house of her own beside the school.<PARAGRAPH>Jane accepts the post, which involves teaching village girls to read, write, do math, sew, and knit.<PARAGRAPH>Diana and Mary are very sad about having to leave; they might not see their brother again for a long time after they take up their new jobs.<PARAGRAPH>St. John gets a letter stating that the Rivers\u2019 Uncle John is dead. Jane watches as all the members of the Rivers family behave somewhat strangely about this\u2014they\u2019re not exactly sad; she\u2019s not sure what they\u2019re feeling. St. John explains that their uncle had argued with their father long before, and that he had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, but decided to leave all the money to another relative.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210506211142/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/jane-eyre/summary/volume-3-chapter-4"}
