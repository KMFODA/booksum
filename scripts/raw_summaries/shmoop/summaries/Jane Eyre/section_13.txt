{"name": "Volume 1, Chapter 14", "summary": "For a little while, Jane doesn\u2019t see Rochester much; he has a lot of business and goes out riding frequently. Sometimes he is haughty or cold, but she can tell that he\u2019s just moody, and that his attitude doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with her.<PARAGRAPH>One evening, Rochester sends for Jane and Ad\u00e8le after dinner. A box of presents that Rochester has bought for Ad\u00e8le has arrived, and he parks her in the corner with it, exactly the way some parents might park a kid in the corner with the TV to keep them busy.<PARAGRAPH>He calls in Mrs. Fairfax, so that Ad\u00e8le can talk to her about the presents while he talks to Jane.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester keeps insisting that Jane bring her chair closer to him instead of moving back into the shadows so that he can\u2019t see her face. He seems to be in a better mood than usual, but he\u2019s still not very good at being polite; he tends to order her around.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, because she is staring at him, Rochester asks Jane if she thinks he\u2019s handsome. Without thinking, she gives an honest answer: no.<PARAGRAPH>Jane\u2019s immediately sorry that she didn\u2019t say something more socially acceptable, like \"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,\" but Rochester doesn\u2019t seem to mind\u2014in fact, he seems glad that she\u2019s honest.<PARAGRAPH>He asks her to criticize him, and she examines his skull and face. (This is more weird nineteenth-century pseudo-science: it was a common belief in the Victorian period that you could determine someone\u2019s character from the shape of their skull. The technical name for this is \"phrenology.\")<PARAGRAPH>Based on the shape of Rochester\u2019s skull, Jane suggests that he might not be very charitable\u2014and, from his reaction, she\u2019s absolutely right.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester explains a little bit about himself, suggesting that, when he was younger, he used to give people the benefit of the doubt, but these days he\u2019s pretty jaded. He asks Jane if she thinks he can turn back into \"flesh\" (i.e., into his old self), but she doesn\u2019t know enough about his past to make the call.<PARAGRAPH>He\u2019s glad, however, that he confused her, because it keeps her from staring piercingly at his face. This is really heating up! Too bad he\u2019s almost twice her age (remember that she\u2019s 18 and he\u2019s 35).<PARAGRAPH>Jane continues to think about Rochester\u2019s appearance; she thinks that a lot of people might find him ugly, but something about the way he carries himself makes him imposing.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester tells her that he\u2019s feeling chatty tonight, and orders Jane to chat with him about something. He\u2019s really not very good at this small-talk stuff. Jane doesn\u2019t know what he likes to talk about, so she doesn\u2019t say anything.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester tries to explain his attitude toward Jane a little; even though he\u2019s kind of abrupt and tends to order her to do things instead of asking, he doesn\u2019t want to treat her as an inferior.<PARAGRAPH>At least, he explains, he only considers himself her superior because he\u2019s so much older and more experienced than she is. And so he will sometimes order her around and be \"masterful,\" he says, but she\u2019ll have to forgive him.<PARAGRAPH>Jane contradicts him: just because he\u2019s older and has done more doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s wiser, she tells him. It depends on what he\u2019s done with those seventeen years he has on her; maybe he hasn\u2019t learned anything. He has to admit that she\u2019s right, but he still wants to be able to order her around sometimes, and tries to think of an excuse.<PARAGRAPH>Jane smiles at this\u2014after all, he\u2019s paying her to take his orders, which he seems to have forgotten. She reminds him, and he leaps on this: will she agree to let him order her around a bit because she\u2019s getting paid?<PARAGRAPH>No, Jane says, getting paid isn\u2019t enough, but she will let him order her around simply because he was worried about her feelings and wanted her to be comfortable with how he treated her.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester presses the point: is it okay if he drops a lot of the polite nonsense? She won\u2019t just think he\u2019s being rude?<PARAGRAPH>Jane\u2019s a bit careful on this point; she\u2019s okay with him being informal, but not with him actually being a jerk. No salary would make up, she says, for actually being treated badly.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester thinks that a lot of people don\u2019t have Jane\u2019s principles and would let themselves get mistreated for money, but he\u2019s impressed with her answers, her tendency to stand up for herself, and her strong personality.<PARAGRAPH>Then Rochester changes his mind a little: Jane is unusual, he says, but maybe she has flaws that make up for her good points. Jane doesn\u2019t say anything, but it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s thinking the same thing about him.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester admits that he has a checkered past, but a lot of it he blames on the circumstances. Again, Jane doesn\u2019t know\u2014and we don\u2019t yet know\u2014exactly what he\u2019s talking about, but it sounds pretty sordid\u2026 and really interesting.<PARAGRAPH>Next Rochester tells Jane that one of her major roles in life is to listen. Did you ever have that one friend who somehow gets to hear everybody\u2019s personal problems? Like, they don\u2019t really ask, but something makes everyone tell that particular person everything?<PARAGRAPH>Rochester thinks Jane is going to be one of those people, but maybe he\u2019s just making excuses for having told her so much already.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester talks about remorse and regretting his past mistakes, whatever those are. Jane advises him to repent, and Rochester says that reform is better than repentance, but that there\u2019s something standing in the way of his reform.<PARAGRAPH>Jane says he\u2019ll just get worse and worse if he keeps grabbing for pleasure without changing, and that eventually his pleasures will sour anyway. He doesn\u2019t like being preached to and objects to this, but Jane holds her ground.<PARAGRAPH>Now Rochester tries to claim that the \"temptation\" he is feeling is actually an \"inspiration,\" that it\u2019s an angel and not a devil. We\u2019re going crazy to know what the heck it is he\u2019s tempted to do. Jane tells him that it\u2019s still a temptation, no matter what he says, and he should resist.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester gets a bit over-excited here and dramatically mimes taking the \"angel\" or \"demon\" or whatever this idea is into himself. Jane\u2019s really confused at this point, but insists that, if Rochester feels like he\u2019s not a good person, that he should make a genuine effort to change.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester tells Jane that he is going to change, and that, if what he\u2019s doing is immoral, then he\u2019ll declare a new moral law to make it right. Jane claims that anything that needs morals to change in order to be okay is obviously immoral.<PARAGRAPH>They argue about ethics for a bit, and Jane keeps getting the better of him. Basically, Rochester really wants to do something, we don\u2019t know what, and Jane can tell from how he talks about it that it\u2019s wrong, even though she doesn\u2019t know what it is or why.<PARAGRAPH>Jane ends the conversation by getting up and going to put Ad\u00e8le to bed. Rochester is worried that he drove her away by saying such weird things, but she assures him that she\u2019s not afraid of him, even though she is a little confused.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester discerns that Jane isn\u2019t naturally so stern and repressed\u2014it\u2019s the effect of Lowood, he says, and it will wear off. He describes her as a caged bird that wants to be free. She doesn\u2019t really say anything to this, but it seems a lot like how she described herself at the beginning of the last chapter.<PARAGRAPH>While Jane and Rochester have been talking, Ad\u00e8le has run out to try on one of the dresses that were among her new presents from Rochester. When she comes back and frolics around in the dress, she looks just like her mother.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester hints at his involvement with Ad\u00e8le\u2019s mother\u2014C\u00e9line Varens. It\u2019s not clear yet what Rochester\u2019s actual relationship to Ad\u00e8le is, but if he was \"involved\" with her mother, then we can guess that maybe he\u2019s her pops.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210506211142/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/jane-eyre/summary/volume-1-chapter-14"}
