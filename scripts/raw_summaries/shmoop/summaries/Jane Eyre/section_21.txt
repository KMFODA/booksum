{"name": "Volume 2, Chapter 7", "summary": "Jane stays at Gateshead for several weeks after Mrs. Reed dies, first to keep Georgiana company until she goes back to London, then to take care of the house while Eliza gets ready to move to a nunnery in France. (There are no nunneries in England at this point because it\u2019s not a Catholic country.)<PARAGRAPH>While traveling back to Thornfield, Jane realizes that she\u2019s never felt happy to go back to a place that has been her home\u2014returning to Lowood or to Gateshead wasn\u2019t much fun.<PARAGRAPH>She wonders if returning to Thornfield might be nicer, but she\u2019s not sure how long she\u2019ll live there if Mr. Rochester is marrying Blanche Ingram. Still, at least she\u2019ll get to see the man she loves for a few weeks. She knows he won\u2019t be there when she arrives; Mrs. Fairfax told her in a letter that he had gone to London to get things for his wedding.<PARAGRAPH>Jane walks the last few miles to Thornfield, and, coming around a corner, sees Mr. Rochester sitting on a stile (a set of steps you use to climb over a fence) writing in a book. She freezes and trembles, and then he sees her and calls her over to him.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester scolds Jane for staying away from him for so long and accuses her of forgetting him. Then he tells her about the carriage he bought for the soon-to-be Mrs. Rochester, and asks if she can\u2019t use her fairy magic to make him handsome. Jane insists that his ugliness is impossible to cure, but the way she\u2019s looking at him suggests otherwise.<PARAGRAPH>Rochester moves a little and lets her cross over the stile, and before she keeps going she thanks him for his kindness and tells him that wherever he is, that\u2019s her true home. Then she walks away really fast before he can answer her.<PARAGRAPH>When Jane arrives at Thornfield, everyone is glad to see her. After dinner, Mr. Rochester, Jane, Mrs. Fairfax, and Ad\u00e8le almost seem like a family.<PARAGRAPH>Interestingly, Blanche Ingram isn\u2019t around anymore; Rochester doesn\u2019t visit her, she doesn\u2019t visit him, and nobody\u2019s talking about marriage. Jane secretly hopes that the engagement is off.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210506211142/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/jane-eyre/summary/volume-2-chapter-7"}
