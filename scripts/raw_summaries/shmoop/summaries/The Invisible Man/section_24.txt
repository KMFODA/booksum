{"name": "Chapter 25", "summary": "Kemp explains to Adye that they have to take measures against Griffin because he's insane, a person of \"pure selfishness\" (25.2).<PARAGRAPH>They have some advantages, though. For one thing, they know that Griffin wants to get to Marvel and his stolen books.<PARAGRAPH>Also, Griffin basically told Kemp his life story, so they have all that information. Kemp knows that they can keep him unstable by making sure he doesn't get a moment to eat or sleep. And of course, he knows that they can use dogs against Griffin.<PARAGRAPH>Kemp even suggests that they put powdered glass on the roads, but Adye objects that \"[i]t's unsportsmanlike\" (25.17). At least someone's worried about that.<PARAGRAPH>Kemp counters that Griffin is inhuman, that \"[h]e has cut himself off from his kind. His blood be upon his own head\" (25.18). Man, we wish we could think of a joke to put here, but this is dark.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126034801/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/invisible-man-wells/summary/chapter-25"}
