Moth comes up with Hercules and Sampson, and a lot of nonsense about Delilah looking like an ogre.<PARAGRAPH>When Armado describes his love as white and red, Moth quips that lust usually comes in those colors. And they can't be trusted in a woman\u2014they might be makeup.<PARAGRAPH>Armado confesses that his crush is Jaquenetta.
