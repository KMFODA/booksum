{"name": "Chapter 29", "summary": "Alan knocks violently on the door until Ebenezer appears from the upstairs window holding his blunderbuss, just as he did when Davie first arrived.<PARAGRAPH>Alan calls up that he's here to speak to Ebenezer about Davie.<PARAGRAPH>Ebenezer says he'll let Alan in.<PARAGRAPH>Alan says he has no plans to enter Ebenezer's house. He wants to have this conversation on the man's doorstep.<PARAGRAPH>Ebenezer comes downstairs to talk to Alan.<PARAGRAPH>Alan tells Ebenezer that his own story is of no consequence, but that he has friends currently living near the island of Mull.<PARAGRAPH>Alan lies to Ebenezer and says that his friends took Davie in after the wreck of the Covenant and spent a lot of money on him. Now they've come to collect silver for his return.<PARAGRAPH>Ebenezer says Davie isn't worth much, and he doesn't plan to pay his debts.<PARAGRAPH>Alan warns Ebenezer that, if his friends learn that Ebenezer isn't going to fork over some money for Davie, they'll toss him out. Ebenezer doesn't care.<PARAGRAPH>Alan argues that he had imagined two possibilities: either Ebenezer loves Davie and would pay to have Davie back, or Ebenezer hates Davie, and would pay Alan's friends to keep him away.<PARAGRAPH>To be clearer, Alan asks Ebenezer point blank: \"what do ye want done with him, and how much will ye pay?\" (29.30). Will Ebenezer pay to have Davie kept a prisoner, or will he pay to have Davie killed?<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Ebenezer says he'll pay to have Davie kept \u2013 after all, Davie is his nephew.<PARAGRAPH>Alan then asks how much Ebenezer paid Hoseason to take Davie. Ebenezer's freaked out that Alan knows Hoseason, and Alan claims that they're partners in this thing.<PARAGRAPH>Ebenezer exclaims that anything Hoseason says is a giant lie. Davie wasn't kidnapped! But, well, it is true that Ebenezer gave Hoseason twenty pounds, and that Hoseason was to have the profits of Davie's sale in the Carolinas.<PARAGRAPH>At this, Rankeillor steps out of his hiding place, along with Davie and Torrance.<PARAGRAPH>Ebenezer is in such shock at seeing these people that he doesn't protest when Alan takes away his gun.<PARAGRAPH>Torrance, Alan, and Davie settle in for supper and wine in Ebenezer's kitchen while Rankeillor goes off to talk seriously with Ebenezer about his fate.<PARAGRAPH>In the end, Davie and Ebenezer agree that Ebenezer will pay Davie two thirds of the income that comes from the Shaws tenants.<PARAGRAPH>So all's well that ends well.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422032710/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/kidnapped/summary/chapter-29"}
