{"name": "Chapter 2", "summary": "(Here's a quick vocabulary lesson in Kipling's Anglo-Indian writing. A babu means a low-level Indian clerk in the British Indian government administration, but it is also a racist term for an Indian who doesn't speak \"proper\"\u2014a.k.a. Anglo\u2014English. In this chapter, the book uses babu to mean a clerk, but the racist implications of the term are still there. For more on Kipling's Anglo-Indian background, check out our \"In a Nutshell\" section.)<PARAGRAPH>At the train station, a babu tries to cheat Kim when he goes to buy tickets for himself and the lama.<PARAGRAPH>Kim is too smart for the guy though, and insists on tickets that go all the way to Umballa.<PARAGRAPH>He also buys a ticket to Amritzar (now spelled Amritsar), which is another big city in the Punjab.<PARAGRAPH>The lama has never traveled by train before, and he is frightened of all the noise.<PARAGRAPH>Kim and the lama board a crowded train car filled with a diverse group of people: a Sikh craftsman, a wealthy Hindu Jat farmer and his wife, an Amritsar courtesan (a.k.a. a prostitute), a Hindu banker, and a Dogra soldier.<PARAGRAPH>They all start chatting more or less nicely (though the farmer's wife clearly does not approve of the Amritzar girl).<PARAGRAPH>The train stops at Amritzar so that the ticket collector can take everybody's tickets.<PARAGRAPH>Remember how we said that Kim bought two tickets, one to Umballa (which is far) and one to Amritzar (which is closer to Lahore)?<PARAGRAPH>Now we find out why.<PARAGRAPH>He gives the Umballa ticket to the lama and keeps the ticket for Amritzar for himself.<PARAGRAPH>At Amritzar, the ticket collector tries to boot Kim off the train for not having the full fare to Umballa.<PARAGRAPH>(We imagine the ticket collector was hoping for something like the classic \"No ticket\" scene in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.)<PARAGRAPH>Kim kicks up a huge fuss about being an orphan who can't leave the poor lama alone with no one to take care of him.<PARAGRAPH>The lama tries to pay Kim's fare, but Kim shushes him: he's working a con here.<PARAGRAPH>The Amritzar girl feels so sorry for Kim that she gives him money for the train ticket and for some extra food.<PARAGRAPH>Kim and the lama continue on the train to Umballa.<PARAGRAPH>The lama gets into a conversation about gods with his fellow passengers, and none of them recognize his Buddhist beliefs; in fact, they all think he's crazy.<PARAGRAPH>The lama seems to be confused by the train, and he worries that they are traveling too fast over the rivers that could be his River of the Arrow.<PARAGRAPH>The farmer's wife is pretty skeptical of all of the lama's talk, but she still offers them a place to stay for the night in Umballa.<PARAGRAPH>Kim slips away to deliver Mahbub Ali's message to the Englishman.<PARAGRAPH>He is pretty sure this is all secret business, so he hides in a nearby hedge and throws Mahbub Ali's message at the Englishman's feet; the Englishman drops a coin on the ground to pay Kim for his troubles.<PARAGRAPH>Kim quietly follows the Englishman and watches him reading Mahbub Ali's message.<PARAGRAPH>The Englishman shares the message with a tall, older man with black hair, who agrees that Mahbub Ali's message is the last straw\u2014they have to send troops north to settle things.<PARAGRAPH>Kim goes to the kitchens to find out who is eating at the house that night.<PARAGRAPH>Creighton Sahib and the Commander-in-Chief\u2014the guest of honor\u2014are both dining there.<PARAGRAPH>(Sahib means sir or master, and in Kipling's Anglo-Indian context, it is usually a word specifically used by Indian Urdu or Hindi speakers towards British or European men.)<PARAGRAPH>So Kim gets excited: He thought Mahbub Ali was probably tangled up with some woman, but it turns out that Mahbub Ali's message is big, serious news to do with real fighting.<PARAGRAPH>Back at the farmer's house in Umballa, the farmer's wife has invited her family's Hindu priest over.<PARAGRAPH>This priest is impressed with the lama's holy manner, even if they don't share beliefs.<PARAGRAPH>They all talk over Kim's prophecy that he will find his fortune when he meets a Red Bull in a green field, and two men will arrive first to make way for his arrival.<PARAGRAPH>The Hindu priest checks out Kim's horoscope and makes a prediction: in three days, the prophecy's two men will come to clear the way for the Bull.<PARAGRAPH>But hanging over the Bull, there is a star sign of war.<PARAGRAPH>So war is in Kim's near future.<PARAGRAPH>The lama goes into a nearby field to look at a small river to see if it is his River.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201020010731/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/kim-rudyard-kipling/summary/chapter-2"}
