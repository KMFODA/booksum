It's also the ingredient in tonic water that gives it that bitter taste.)<PARAGRAPH>Kim recognizes that, yes, the kid has a fever, but the real problem is that he is malnourished.<PARAGRAPH>So Kim gives the boy a cube of beef bouillon to suck on (which sounds revolting: concentrated beef juice\u2014ugh).<PARAGRAPH>He also gives the father six cubes to boil up in water or milk.<PARAGRAPH>And he hands over a quinine pill.<PARAGRAPH>Kim tells the Punjabi farmer to come back the next day with his son, who should be fine now that he has food and medicine.<PARAGRAPH>The lama is deeply impressed by how much Kim has learned.<PARAGRAPH>But he isn't totally surprised\u2014it turns out the lama has been keeping track of Kim, first through letters from Father Victor, and then through direct news from the Babu.<PARAGRAPH>The lama is glad to see that Kim is ready, because the time has come: they need to set out once again to search for the River of the Arrow.<PARAGRAPH>They wait until the next morning to see what news the Punjabi father brings of his son's health.<PARAGRAPH>The son is much better, and the lama brags about Kim's mad skillz in healing to the watching Jain monks.<PARAGRAPH>Kim offers the Punjabi farmer more medicine in case the sickness comes back\u2014but this time, he has to pay with food.<PARAGRAPH>At this temple, Kim has to eat lightly, and it's all vegetarian.
