{"name": "Chapter 23", "summary": "The newlyweds go for a walk around their cottage, but Victor has the I'm-about-to-fight-a-monster wedding night jitters.<PARAGRAPH>Inside the cottage, he sends Elizabeth to bed so he can search the house for the monster. Uh, we're pretty sure this isn't how a wedding night is supposed to go down.<PARAGRAPH>And in the grand tradition of horror movies everywhere, splitting up is a majorly bad idea.<PARAGRAPH>He hears Elizabeth scream. It suddenly hits Victor what we've all known for chapters now: the monster didn't want to kill him. He wanted to kill Elizabeth.<PARAGRAPH>(If you're keeping track, this brings the body count up to four.)<PARAGRAPH>Poor Victor really hates himself at this point. He goes home to Geneva to tell his father the sad news, and the man drops dead from grief. That makes five.<PARAGRAPH>Just like the monster he created, Victor is now alone and miserable.<PARAGRAPH>He goes to a magistrate to try and tell him about the monster and Elizabeth's death, but the magistrate obviously doesn't believe him and probably thinks seriously about locking the guy up.<PARAGRAPH>Since Victor has nothing left to live for, he decides to spend the rest of his life hunting down the monster.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507234146/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/frankenstein/summary/chapter-23"}
