One of the first things he learns is that fire is good (it keeps you warm) and bad (it hurts if you touch it).<PARAGRAPH>He tries to get food by going into a hut, but the inhabitants scream in fear and run out. The same thing happens to him every time he goes into a village, or actually, anywhere people live.<PARAGRAPH>The monster realizes that people hate him because he's ugly. It's pretty sad.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, he finds a small hovel near a cottage and settles in there, watching the family, which consists of a blind old man, and two younger people.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507234146/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/frankenstein/summary/chapter-11"}
