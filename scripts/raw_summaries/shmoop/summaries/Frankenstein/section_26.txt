Elizabeth is unfazed, so they get married and head off to a family cottage in the middle of nowhere.<PARAGRAPH>(Just a hint, Shmoopers: never marry someone who has a big secret they can't reveal until after the wedding.)", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507234146/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/frankenstein/summary/chapter-22"}
