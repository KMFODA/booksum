Henry just tried to toss Fanny into the deep end of the pool, so to speak.<PARAGRAPH>Henry comes back to woo Fanny some more.<PARAGRAPH>He tries to impress her by reading some Shakespeare aloud. He and Edmund discuss plays and the art of reading aloud and oration, or public speaking.<PARAGRAPH>Lady Bertram is impressed, however, and says that Henry is a rather good actor.<PARAGRAPH>Even Fanny is interested when Henry is reading aloud but tries to ignore him for the sake of keeping up her stance.<PARAGRAPH>Lady Bertram asks if Henry will ever do any theater at his house and Henry says no quite loudly since Fanny definitely wouldn't like him to come over.<PARAGRAPH>Edmund and Henry discuss public speaking and sermons, but this just makes Fanny disapprove of Henry more as he makes light of sermons and the like.<PARAGRAPH>Henry notices his love is frowning and pesters her until she finally tells him that he's not serious or steady enough for her taste.<PARAGRAPH>Henry finally understands what her problem is and tells her that he'll prove to her that he really can be constant and responsible.<PARAGRAPH>He insists that he loves her and that he'll prove himself worthy of marrying her.<PARAGRAPH>Fanny is still miserable since Henry just won't quit.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061744/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/mansfield-park/summary/chapter-34"}
