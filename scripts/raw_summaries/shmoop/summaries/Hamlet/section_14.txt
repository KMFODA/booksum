More specifically, he's on the Danish coast near the Danish castle.<PARAGRAPH>And what does he see but the armies of Prince Fortinbras of Norway, who it seems has decided to wage war with Poland instead of with Denmark.<PARAGRAPH>Hamlet assumes Fortinbras must be taking on the whole country, but after talking with one of his Captains he learns that this is a huge conflict being waged over a tiny, unimportant piece of territory.<PARAGRAPH>This makes Hamlet think. He concludes that, if Fortinbras can lead 20,000 men to their death over a little patch of land, then he should be able to rain vengeance upon the man who has killed his father and \"stained\" his mother.<PARAGRAPH>Right?<PARAGRAPH>He swears to follow Fortinbras' example, stop delaying and finally carry out his revenge.<PARAGRAPH>Suuuuuuuure he will.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227102129/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/hamlet/summary/act-iv-scene-iv"}
