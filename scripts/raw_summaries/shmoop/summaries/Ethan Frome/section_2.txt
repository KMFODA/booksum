{"name": "Chapter 2", "summary": "As the youths rush out of the church basement Ethan stands back and watches.<PARAGRAPH>It is a merry scene.<PARAGRAPH>He hears a woman call out to Mattie, asking her if she plans on doing a little sledding tonight.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan feels his pulse suddenly race.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie declines the offer to sled, citing weather.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan is very near Mattie, though they can't see each other.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan knows Mattie will show herself soon, and that as his eyes are adjusted to the dark, he'll be able to see her clearly.<PARAGRAPH>(Though she won't be able to see him.)<PARAGRAPH>Shyness takes him and he hides a little more.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie's who Ethan thinks is a brighter, easier person than himself, had helped bring him out of his shell, and had helped lighten him up.<PARAGRAPH>But now Ethan feels uneasy, like back when he was in college, and \"had tried to 'jolly' the [\u2026] girls\" (2.3).<PARAGRAPH>(It's implied that Ethan wasn't too successful in his jollying.)<PARAGRAPH>Mattie, one of the last to exit the dance, looks around, maybe like she's looking for Ethan.<PARAGRAPH>A man walks near her.<PARAGRAPH>The man insinuates that Mattie has been stood-up by Ethan, and says he has his dad's \"cutter\" to help rectify the situation.<PARAGRAPH>He wants to use it to sled with Mattie.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan is in suspense.<PARAGRAPH>Denis fetches the old cutter, but Mattie laughingly refuses his advances.<PARAGRAPH>He continues trying to persuade her, and they move beyond Ethan's range of sight and vision.<PARAGRAPH>(Finally) Ethan hears Eady drive up, and he runs to Mattie, and asks her if she thought he'd stood her up.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie says she didn't; but that she thought maybe Zeena was sick.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan assures her this is not the case, and asks Mattie if she intended to walk home all by herself.<PARAGRAPH>Excitedly, she says she is not afraid of the long walk home.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan asks why she didn't accept Denis' offer to drive her.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie asks how he knew about the Denis thing, laughing.<PARAGRAPH>They walk on, arm in arm, in the darkness.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan desires to rub his check on Mattie's scarf.<PARAGRAPH>Instead, he asks Mattie if she'd like to make a coasting date with him.<PARAGRAPH>They decide to have a little coasting adventure the following night, provided the moon is bright.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie tells Ethan that the other night Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum had almost met their deaths by accidentally crashing into an elm tree at the bottom of the slope.<PARAGRAPH>It would have been so sad, because Ned and Ruth are happy and in love.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan claims he can take that elm tree with his sled anytime, and asks if Mattie would still be afraid of the elm if he were driving the sled.<PARAGRAPH>She says she's not the fearful kind, but she says it like she doesn't care.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie is a person of quickly changing moods.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan doesn't feel he has \"the right to show his feelings\" and find out hers (2.38).<PARAGRAPH>So he's constantly trying to read every little thing she does and says to see if she likes him, and knows he likes her.<PARAGRAPH>Right now he thinks she doesn't care.<PARAGRAPH>When she dissed Denis Eady he felt joy.<PARAGRAPH>Now he feels almost like there is no hope.<PARAGRAPH>But Ethan needs to know if she likes him, and so he tries to provoke her a little.<PARAGRAPH>He suggests that if she hadn't danced that extra dance with Denis Eady, she would have seen Ethan right away.<PARAGRAPH>She doesn't try to defend herself.<PARAGRAPH>He takes the more direct approach and says he imagines that the rumors are true.<PARAGRAPH>She wants to know what rumors he's talking about.<PARAGRAPH>Rumors, he tells her, that she'll be leaving the Frome household soon.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie begins to freak out, and she asks Ethan if Zeena has had enough of her.<PARAGRAPH>She says she knows she's not the most excellent helper in the world, but that she could do better if Zeena would just express her needs a little more.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie can tell by Zeena's face that she isn't happy with her.<PARAGRAPH>She begs Ethan to tell her what Zeena needs \u2013 unless he too wants to see her gone.<PARAGRAPH>Of course he doesn't want her to go. Her words soothe him. He knows she wants to stay.<PARAGRAPH>They walk together quietly.<PARAGRAPH>When they hear a gunshot, and then a fox bark, Mattie snuggles up closer to Ethan and then begins to walk faster.<PARAGRAPH>He asks her if she for sure doesn't want to leave the Frome house.<PARAGRAPH>She asks him where she would possibly go if she left, and Ethan thinks she might be crying, though she denies it when he asks her.<PARAGRAPH>He feels her warm body next to his.<PARAGRAPH>They walk in though the gate of the Frome house, and passed \"the Frome grave-stones slanted at crazy angles through the snow\" (2.55).<PARAGRAPH>The gravestones seem to speak to Ethan. Taunting him they seem to say, if they couldn't escape Starkfield, how could Ethan?<PARAGRAPH>Ethan has the sudden thought that he will be stuck in Starkfield until he dies.<PARAGRAPH>He knows he has to find a way to keep Mattie with him forever, and he imagines being buried with her when they both die.<PARAGRAPH>When he has thoughts like that he feels happy.<PARAGRAPH>Mattie trips and steadies herself by yanking on Ethan's sleeve.<PARAGRAPH>He puts his arms around her for the first time.<PARAGRAPH>She doesn't try to stop him. They walk together this way.<PARAGRAPH>Zeena is probably in bed.<PARAGRAPH>She always goes to bed right after she eats.<PARAGRAPH>The windows of the house are dark.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan sees \"a dead cucumber vine\" drooping off the porch (2.58).<PARAGRAPH>Sometimes people tie a streamer to a door handle when a person formerly living in the house has died. The vine reminds Ethan of one of those.<PARAGRAPH>He imagines it might be for Zeena.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan imagines her lying upstairs now, in bed, with her mouth open. Zeena doesn't have any of her own teeth left. He imagines her fake teeth, in a cup by their bed.<PARAGRAPH>Zeena usually locks the door and leaves the key under the mat for Ethan and Mattie.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan and Mattie stop groping each other, and Ethan goes for the key.<PARAGRAPH>Alas! The key is not to be found. A bit of a panic ensues.<PARAGRAPH>Something stirs from within the house.<PARAGRAPH>The door opens.<PARAGRAPH>Zeena appears.<PARAGRAPH>She has a blanket wrapped around herself with one hand, and is holding onto a lamp with the other.<PARAGRAPH>Her face is cast in shadows.<PARAGRAPH>She looks very different to Ethan, than ever before.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan and Mattie walk into the bitterly cold kitchen.<PARAGRAPH>He asks Zeena if she forgot the key.<PARAGRAPH>She says, \"No. I just felt so mean I couldn't sleep\" (2.70)<PARAGRAPH>(These phrase is rather ambiguous, at least until we know more. Click here for some meanings of the word \"mean\" and see which ones you think apply.)<PARAGRAPH>Mattie understands this to mean that Zeena has been feeling physically ill and rushes to her offering sympathy and help.<PARAGRAPH>Zeena refuses, and gripes at her for not stomping her boots before entering the house.<PARAGRAPH>Then she walks over to the stairs.<PARAGRAPH>Ethan wants make sure that Mattie goes up before he does.<PARAGRAPH>Otherwise, she might seem him walking into the bedroom with Zeena, and he doesn't like the idea of this.<PARAGRAPH>So, Ethan says he's going to stay down and do a little accounting work.<PARAGRAPH>Zeena says he'll get sick if he works without heat.<PARAGRAPH>(In the early 1900s, when this book is set there wasn't too much central heating going on, certainly not in Starkfield.)<PARAGRAPH>He looks at Mattie as he walks away toward the kitchen, and she looks a little afraid.<PARAGRAPH>When she's safely headed up the stairs, he agrees with Zeena about the cold, and follows her up the stairs.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210420064521/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ethan-frome/summary/chapter-2"}
