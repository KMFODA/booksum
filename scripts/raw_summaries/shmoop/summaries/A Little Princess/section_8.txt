{"name": "Chapter 9", "summary": "The other person who helps Sara get through some rough times is Lottie, who adores her and can't figure why Sara looks all shabby now.<PARAGRAPH>Lottie somehow gets up to Sara's room and starts crying because it's so bad.<PARAGRAPH>(Lottie has also never seen a princess movie, so she doesn't know how this story is going to end.)<PARAGRAPH>Sara bravely tells her that the room isn't so bad and that she can see all sorts of things from the attic.<PARAGRAPH>They look out the window. The house next door is empty and Sara says she wishes someone lived over there so she'd have someone to talk to.<PARAGRAPH>They feed crumbs to the sparrows and Sara talks dreamily about all the amazing things that she can see from up there.<PARAGRAPH>She even pretends that her room is full of nice furniture.<PARAGRAPH>Lottie is convinced, but Sara isn't quite. Once Lottie leaves, she sits around feeling pretty sorry for herself.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, a large rat emerges from the wall with its eye on some of the crumbs that Lottie dropped.<PARAGRAPH>Sara doesn't scream like other little girls (and Shmoop) would. Instead, she watches the rat and encourages him to come out.<PARAGRAPH>Though he's pretty scared, the rat finally takes the crumbs and then darts back into the wall<PARAGRAPH>A week later, Ermengarde comes to join Sara in her room and overhears Sara speaking to someone named Melchisedec.<PARAGRAPH>Who is Melchisedec, you (and Ermengarde) ask, and why is his name such a mouthful?<PARAGRAPH>Oh, it's just the rat, no biggie.<PARAGRAPH>Sara says that she imagines Melchisedec's whole life and his family.<PARAGRAPH>Then, they hear a knock from the other room. It's Becky, who communicates with Sara through the wall.<PARAGRAPH>Sara tells Ermengarde stories for the rest of the night, and they're all like one big happy family.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508042453/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/little-princess/summary/chapter-9"}
