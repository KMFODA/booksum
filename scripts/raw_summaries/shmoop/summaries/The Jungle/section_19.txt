{"name": "Chapter 20", "summary": "Jurgis sobers up and goes home.<PARAGRAPH>Ona is going to be buried the next day in Chicago's \"potter's field,\" a public cemetery for people too poor to afford their own burial plot.<PARAGRAPH>Teta Elzbieta is begging around the neighborhood for money to give Ona a proper Catholic funeral mass.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Jukniene scolds Jurgis for going out and spending the last of their money while they owe rent and the children are all starving.<PARAGRAPH>In the attic room, Marija is sitting holding Antanas, and Juozapas Lukoszaite is crying with hunger.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis sits thinking of Ona and how much he loves her.<PARAGRAPH>Teta Elzbieta comes home. She has gotten the money for Ona's mass.<PARAGRAPH>Teta Elzbieta sits next to Jurgis and pleads with him. She begs Jurgis to pull himself together, get a job, and help the family.<PARAGRAPH>Teta Elzbieta is afraid that Jurgis will abandon his family now, as Jonas had done.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis agrees to try, for his son's sake.<PARAGRAPH>So the next morning, Jurgis goes out to his fertilizer plant. Yet there is no job waiting for him there.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis tries at place after place to find a job.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, Elzbieta is still feeding her children with the money that she has been begging for in Chicago's Hyde Park.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, Jurgis lucks out. He thinks he's found a job at Jones's meatpacking plant pushing carts. (BTW, this is the job that Jonas had before he ran away.)<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis appears the next morning to start work under the foreman he spoke to the day before.<PARAGRAPH>The foreman apologizes: he's made a mistake. He can't use Jurgis.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis's friends at one of the bars explain to him that he has been blacklisted. After beating the stuffing out of a boss in the yards, does Jurgis really think anyone at the meatpacking plants will hire him again? He's got no chance for another job at Packingtown.<PARAGRAPH>He, Teta Elzbieta, and Marija discuss the possibility of moving.<PARAGRAPH>Moving would bring them closer to the children's workplace.<PARAGRAPH>But Marija's hand is feeling better, and she wants to try and find a meatpacking job.<PARAGRAPH>What's more, Marija can't quite bring herself to abandon Tamoszius Kuszleika, even though she only sees him about once a month nowadays.<PARAGRAPH>Teta Elzbieta also thinks she might be able to get a job cleaning at Durham's offices.<PARAGRAPH>So the family decides that Jurgis should go downtown by himself to look for work and then they can decide.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis goes downtown, homeless and alone.<PARAGRAPH>He begs and gets small jobs here and there, but he doesn't find solid work for two weeks.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Jurgis gets a position thanks to a union friend of his.<PARAGRAPH>This friend points Jurgis in the direction of a well-meaning, enlightened factory that makes farm implements.<PARAGRAPH>This place is called Harvester Trust, and it pays good money. It also has airy, nice workshops, and even a reading room.<PARAGRAPH>Even if Harvester Trust seems well-meaning, it's still a factory with an assembly line and lots of big machines.<PARAGRAPH>The work is boring and repetitive, and the company employs child workers.<PARAGRAPH>Even so, Jurgis is making money again \u2013 he has enough to pay his rent and to pick up his coat from the pawn shop.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis wants to start over and to save money for his (remaining) family now that the interest from the house is no longer draining him dry.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis starts to have hope again.<PARAGRAPH>Then, of course, Jurgis is ruined again: when he goes to Harvester Trust for work, he finds that the company has been shut down until further notice.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210123044944/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-jungle/summary/chapter-20"}
