They're supposed to write a story.<PARAGRAPH>Diana's daunted by the assignment, but Anne's already done hers.<PARAGRAPH>Anne tells Diana her entire amazingly melodramatic story. It's about two friends, Cordelia Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour, who love the same man, Bertram DeVere.<PARAGRAPH>We won't spoil the ending for you, but it's a tragedy.<PARAGRAPH>Anne and Diana start a story club where they write stories for practice. Eventually they add two other friends, Jane Andrews and Ruby Gillis.<PARAGRAPH>Jane's stories are too sensible, Ruby's have too much love in them, and Diana's have too many murders (according to Anne).
