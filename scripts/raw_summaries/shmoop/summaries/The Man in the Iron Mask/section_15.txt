{"name": "Chapter Sixteen: Jealousy", "summary": "The fireworks begin.<PARAGRAPH>King Louis XIV reads the piece of paper, which he assumes is a love note for himself. Wrong. It is a letter from Fouquet to La Valliere proclaiming his love for her.<PARAGRAPH>The King is angry. Fouquet notices the change in the King's mood and asks for the source of the problem. The King says \"nothing\" and heads back to the chateau. The entire court is obliged to follow.<PARAGRAPH>Fouquet assumes the King has had a quarrel with La Valliere. Fouquet sends for D'Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>The King requests that Fouquet be arrested.<PARAGRAPH>D'Artagnan is astonished. Finally, he asks the King for a written order, mindful that the King may later change his mind.<PARAGRAPH>D'Artagnan protests the arrest.<PARAGRAPH>Before he leaves, the King asks D'Artagnan to keep it a private affair.<PARAGRAPH>D'Artagnan says that is a rather difficult proposition.<PARAGRAPH>The King then asks D'Artagnan to simply watch over Fouquet until the morning, when a final decision will be made.<PARAGRAPH>The King dismisses D'Artagnan, then paces all around his room, fuming. He now (incorrectly) assumes La Valliere defended Fouquet because she loves him too.<PARAGRAPH>The King has an fit, knocks over a table, and throws himself onto his bed.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507123624/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/man-in-the-iron-mask/summary/chapter-sixteen-jealousy"}
