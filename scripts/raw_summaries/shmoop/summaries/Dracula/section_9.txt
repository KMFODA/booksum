{"name": "Chapter 10", "summary": "Seward writes to Arthur Holmwood to tell him that Lucy isn't so good.<PARAGRAPH>He disguises just how bad she is, though, because he knows that Arthur is with his sick father and can't very well leave him.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing arrives and examines Lucy again.<PARAGRAPH>He has some idea of what's wrong with her, but he won't tell Seward yet.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy is very pale and her face seems more bony than usual.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing says she needs a blood transfusion immediately. (This was very high-tech at that time\u2014and it was a pretty messy procedure. Nothing like donating blood at a blood drive nowadays, where you sit in a chair and hardly feel a thing, then eat cookies. Back in 1897, it was a new procedure, and the needles they used were huge.)<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Seward volunteers because he's younger and stronger than Van Helsing (who used to be his teacher and is probably in his late forties or fifties).<PARAGRAPH>Besides, Dr. Seward is still in love with Lucy, remember? Of course he wants to donate blood to her.<PARAGRAPH>But before he can, Arthur Holmwood arrives.<PARAGRAPH>As Lucy's fianc\u00e9, he gets dibs on giving her a blood transfusion.<PARAGRAPH>After the transfusion, Lucy is sleeping peacefully and looks a little better.<PARAGRAPH>The black ribbon around her neck slips aside, and Van Helsing sees a \"red mark\" (10.29) on her throat and seems alarmed by it.<PARAGRAPH>But he doesn't explain it to Arthur and Seward.<PARAGRAPH>Reassured that Lucy's going to be okay, Arthur leaves to go back to his father, who is on his deathbed.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing instructs Dr. Seward to stay with Lucy all night and to call him if anything happens.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy sleeps well (partly because they gave her a sleeping drug with opium in it; that helped).<PARAGRAPH>She wakes up and tells Dr. Seward that she's afraid to go back to sleep because of all the terrible dreams she's been having.<PARAGRAPH>He assures her that he'll stay with her all night, and that if he sees that she's having a nightmare he'll wake her up.<PARAGRAPH>This makes her feel better, and she goes right to sleep.<PARAGRAPH>The next morning, Seward heads back to his office at the asylum to check on his patients.<PARAGRAPH>Seward is getting pretty worn out\u2014he didn't sleep at all during the day of September 8 because he was working at the asylum, and he has now sat up with Lucy for two nights in a row.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy takes one look at him and tells him to sleep on the couch just outside her room\u2014she'll call him if she needs anything during the night.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy writes in her diary that she is feeling a lot better, especially knowing that Dr. Seward is just outside her room in case she needs him.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Seward is woken up by Dr. Van Helsing.<PARAGRAPH>He tells Van Helsing that Lucy looked pretty good the night before, and even insisted that he catch up on his sleep there on the couch.<PARAGRAPH>They go into her room to check on her, and find her worse than ever.<PARAGRAPH>She needs another blood transfusion ASAP.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Seward donates the blood this time, but with the understanding that neither of them will tell Arthur about it\u2014he might get jealous.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy sleeps for a long time, and still looks weak, although better than she did before.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Seward goes home to sleep that night, and Van Helsing agrees to stay and watch Lucy during the night.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy seems much better, and Van Helsing seems cheerful.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing puts a bunch of garlic flowers in Lucy's room, and tells her that they are medicinal, so she shouldn't throw them out or move them without his permission.<PARAGRAPH>He puts some of them over her window and around her neck.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy is skeptical at first, but then accepts them and thanks him.<PARAGRAPH>Seward doesn't get it either, but Van Helsing won't explain it to him.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219141110/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/dracula/summary/chapter-10"}
