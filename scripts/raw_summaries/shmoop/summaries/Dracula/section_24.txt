{"name": "Chapter 25", "summary": "That evening, Mina calls them all together around sunset (when she's best able to talk without restraint or influence from the Count).<PARAGRAPH>She asks them to promise that they'll kill her if she gets vampire-y.<PARAGRAPH>They all promise, even Jonathan.<PARAGRAPH>Then she asks them to read the burial service to her, in case she's too vampire-y in the future to have it read at her funeral.<PARAGRAPH>Jonathan reads it, and everyone gets all choked up.<PARAGRAPH>They're in Varna, now (a port on the Black Sea), waiting for the Czarina Catherine to arrive.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing has been hypnotizing Mina every day at sunrise and sunset, just to check on where the Count is.<PARAGRAPH>The answer is always the same: He's still in his box on a boat.<PARAGRAPH>They bribe the officials at the port to keep them posted on the Czarina Catherine's progress and to warn them when the ship is getting close.<PARAGRAPH>Everything's still the same.<PARAGRAPH>They're all ready!<PARAGRAPH>Still waiting.<PARAGRAPH>But they receive a telegram saying that the Czarina Catherine just entered the Dardanelles (the narrow strip of water separating the Black Sea from the Mediterranean).<PARAGRAPH>He's writing in his journal by hand, now, because the phonograph was too big and clunky to take on the long trip.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone's excited that Dracula's ship is so close\u2014only 24 hours away, tops.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Seward and Van Helsing are worried about Mina: She's sometimes restless, and sometimes sleepy, but rarely like her old self.<PARAGRAPH>Still no word of the ship. It should be in the port by now.<PARAGRAPH>Mina still reports that she hears \"lapping water,\" so they know the Count is still in the boat somewhere\u2026<PARAGRAPH>They receive a telegram that the Czarina Catherine has arrived in Galatz, a different port city.<PARAGRAPH>The next train for Galatz leaves early the next morning.<PARAGRAPH>Mina feels better and freer than she has in a long time\u2014it's like the weight of the Count's influence has been lifted.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing thinks that the Count has realized that they've been using the connection with Mina to their advantage, and has withdrawn his influence.<PARAGRAPH>This is good and bad: It's better for Mina, but now they can't hypnotize her to check on where the Count is.<PARAGRAPH>So they have to deduce where the Count is going to go based on what they know about him already.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing and Dr. Seward compare the Count's mind to a criminal's and use what they know about criminal psychology to guess where he'll go next.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219141110/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/dracula/summary/chapter-25"}
