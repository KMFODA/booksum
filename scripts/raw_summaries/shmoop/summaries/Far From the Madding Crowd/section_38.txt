{"name": "Chapter 39", "summary": "Bathsheba and Sergeant Troy are travelling to the local market to deal with some business. Bathsheba is sitting up in a cart, while Sergeant Troy is on the road leading the horses. They argue briefly about how much of Bathsheba's money Troy has been blowing at horse races.<PARAGRAPH>Troy tells her that if he'd known she was such a nag he wouldn't have married her.<PARAGRAPH>As they travel, a homeless-looking woman walks past them and asks Troy what time the local shelter in Casterbridge closes for the night.<PARAGRAPH>Troy is clearly concerned by the sound of this woman's voice, but he pretends to be chill and tells her he's not sure about the closing time.<PARAGRAPH>When the woman sees Troy's face, she utters a cry and falls to the ground. Bathsheba tries to help, but Troy orders her to stay where she is.<PARAGRAPH>In a hushed voice, Troy asks the woman why she didn't just write to him for money. He then gives her every last penny he has on him.<PARAGRAPH>Before they part ways, Troy tells her to meet him at a place called Grey's Bridge on the next Monday. While he's saying this, he calls her Fanny.<PARAGRAPH>So we know that this woman is Fanny Robin, Troy's jilted ex-fianc\u00e9.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Troy hurries Fanny away and returns to his cart and Bathsheba. Bathsheba asks him if he knew the woman, but he denies it, saying he only knows her face from around town.<PARAGRAPH>Bathsheba isn't convinced, though, and she's certain that Troy has had some previous contact with this woman. Good call, Bathsheba.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219162644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/far-from-the-madding-crowd/summary/chapter-39"}
