{"name": "Chapter 27", "summary": "David decides to catch up with his old school friend, Traddles.<PARAGRAPH>He finds Traddles's lodging house in a shabby little side street. The house actually reminds him a lot of the days he spent boarding with the Micawbers.<PARAGRAPH>Indeed, just as David arrives, he sees a milkman asking the servant girl at the house if anyone is going to pay his bill: this really reminds him of his days with the Micawbers.<PARAGRAPH>David approaches the door and asks the servant girl if someone named Traddles lives there.<PARAGRAPH>He does! And Traddles welcomes David to his room.<PARAGRAPH>David notices that both Traddles's good nature and his bad luck seem not to have changed: Traddles is having serious money troubles.<PARAGRAPH>The two of them remind each other of the old days back with Mr. Creakle at Salem House.<PARAGRAPH>Traddles seems (weirdly) to have forgotten how brutal Mr. Creakle was to him, or at least, to have let it go.<PARAGRAPH>The uncle who raised Traddles died soon after Traddles left Salem House.<PARAGRAPH>Unfortunately, the uncle didn't like Traddles much, so he didn't leave Traddles any money in his will.<PARAGRAPH>So, Traddles was left alone without much money or any professional training.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, a friend of his from school (named Yawler, who came to the school after David left) helped Traddles become a law clerk.<PARAGRAPH>Traddles has been tying to climb into the law business through working hard and making lots of connections (including with Mr. Waterbrook).<PARAGRAPH>David's old friend has managed to make enough money to take the bar exams, which is what he's studying for now.<PARAGRAPH>Traddles is really happy with his situation, because he's gotten engaged to a lovely clergyman's daughter.<PARAGRAPH>Even though it'll be a long time before Traddles will be able to scrape together enough money to get married, he's still happy as a clam waiting to marry the girl he loves.<PARAGRAPH>Traddles tells David that Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, his landlords, are great company.<PARAGRAPH>David is absolutely astonished at the news that he is going to reunite with the Micawbers yet again.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, there is a distinctive knock at the door: it's Mr. Micawber!<PARAGRAPH>David asks how Mr. Micawber is, and how his wife and children are doing.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Micawber answers that they are fine, all the while not recognizing David.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, when he sees David smile, Mr. Micawber startles and exclaims that it is Copperfield!<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Micawber calls down to Mrs. Micawber that they have a visitor she should see.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Micawber asks after all the people he knew in Canterbury, where they last met.<PARAGRAPH>All the while, David can hear the sounds of Mrs. Micawber in the room next door, opening and shutting drawers: she's getting ready to receive guests.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Mrs. Micawber comes in, looking a little sloppier than she used to but still making an effort for company.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Micawber faints at the sight of David.<PARAGRAPH>After reviving her with water from the well in the backyard, the Micawbers, David, and Traddles all chat for half an hour.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Micawber asks David to stay for dinner, but David can see that Mrs. Micawber is worried about how much food they have on hand, so he refuses.<PARAGRAPH>David invites Traddles and the Micawbers to come and eat with him at his house.<PARAGRAPH>As David is leaving, Mr. Micawber pulls him aside.<PARAGRAPH>He explains that it is delightful to have someone as smart and pleasant around the house as Traddles, because otherwise, the neighborhood is disappointing.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Micawber is currently involved in the corn trade, which (as usual) is not making him much money.<PARAGRAPH>David's old landlord is hoping that something will turn up soon because Mrs. Micawber is, in fact, pregnant (or, as Mr. Micawber puts it, \"an addition may be ultimately made [...] in short, to the infantine group\" (27.88).", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200929182814/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/david-copperfield/summary/chapter-27"}
