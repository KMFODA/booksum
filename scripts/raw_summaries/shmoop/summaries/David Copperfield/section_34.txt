{"name": "Chapter 35", "summary": "David suggests that Mr. Dick could stay in the same place where Mr. Peggotty slept during his stay in London.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Dick tells David that he has no idea how Miss Betsey came to lose all her money.<PARAGRAPH>David is so frustrated that he takes it out on Mr. Dick, and explains that no money means starvation for Miss Betsey and Mr. Dick.<PARAGRAPH>This really freaks Mr. Dick out.<PARAGRAPH>David tells Mr. Dick that the best thing they can do is to stay cheerful and not add to Miss Betsey's troubles.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Dick tries, but he keeps staring at Miss Betsey as though he is going to see her waste away to nothing right before his eyes.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey behaves with a calmness that really impresses David.<PARAGRAPH>David's aunt asks for ale instead of her usual glass of wine before bed, so that they can save the wine for later.<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty walks Mr. Dick back to the shop where he is staying.<PARAGRAPH>David brings back some ale for Miss Betsey.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey tells David that she has really come to like Peggotty.<PARAGRAPH>David's aunt starts to tear up, and informs David that Peggotty has offered her money, as though Peggotty has so much of it in the first place.<PARAGRAPH>While David was out getting ale, Miss Betsey and Peggotty were gossiping.<PARAGRAPH>Peggotty has told Miss Betsey all about little Emily, and Miss Betsey comments on her foolishness.<PARAGRAPH>David tells Miss Betsey that he has fallen in love with Dora.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey asks all about her: is she silly? Is she light-headed?<PARAGRAPH>David has never thought of these questions before.<PARAGRAPH>He answers that he is sure that he and Dora could never love anybody else.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey shakes her head and comments that David reminds her of his mother.<PARAGRAPH>David needs someone who is faithful and serious in his life.<PARAGRAPH>He promises that Dora is earnest, but Miss Betsey just shakes her head and tells him he is blind.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey says they should hope for better fortunes so that David can get married, if he really wants to.<PARAGRAPH>David's aunt goes to bed, and David takes the sofa.<PARAGRAPH>He lies there worrying about what will happen when he tells Dora about his poor fortune.<PARAGRAPH>The night feels ages long as David worries and has bad dreams, and Miss Betsey paces all around.<PARAGRAPH>The next morning, David walks to the office early to speak to Mr. Spenlow.<PARAGRAPH>David explains that he has had bad news from his aunt \u2013 that she is ruined \u2013 and wants to cancel his apprenticeship.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Spenlow says that it's neither common nor professional to cancel such a thing.<PARAGRAPH>David's boss claims that it's just Mr. Jorkins who would object; if it were up to Mr. Spenlow, he'd let David go.<PARAGRAPH>David asks if he can approach Mr. Jorkins directly.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Spenlow warns David that it will be useless.<PARAGRAPH>Still, David heads out to meet Mr. Jorkins.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Jorkins hears David's story and expresses sympathy, but he says that, if Mr. Spenlow objects, well, there's nothing he can do about it.<PARAGRAPH>David tells Mr. Jorkins that Mr. Spenlow doesn't object personally.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Jorkins says it's impossible, and anyway, he has an appointment at his bank.<PARAGRAPH>The man runs out the door and hides from the office for three days.<PARAGRAPH>David then begs Mr. Spenlow to use his influence to persuade Mr. Jorkins.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Spenlow promises David that nothing will change Mr. Jorkins's mind.<PARAGRAPH>David is confused: which of the two men, Spenlow or Jorkins, are really objecting to his request?<PARAGRAPH>Disappointed, David goes home: there's no way he's going to get his aunt's money back.<PARAGRAPH>As he's walking home, David sees someone passing by in a carriage: it's Agnes!<PARAGRAPH>David tells Agnes that she is the person he most wants to talk to in all the world (well, except maybe for Dora).<PARAGRAPH>Agnes is on her way to see Miss Betsey at David's rooms.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey left the Wickfields a very short and unclear note stating that she has been ruined, but that no one needs to worry about her because she'll be fine.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Wickfield and Uriah Heep had business in London, and Agnes hitched a ride to check on Miss Betsey.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Mr. Wickfield and Uriah Heep have become partners.<PARAGRAPH>It gets worse: Uriah Heep and his mother have moved in to Mr. Wickfield's house.<PARAGRAPH>Uriah Heep has David's old room.<PARAGRAPH>Agnes fondly remembers the old days when David lived with them.<PARAGRAPH>She hates that she can't stick as close to her father as she wants: Agnes worries that Uriah Heep is plotting some kind of betrayal of Mr. Wickfield.<PARAGRAPH>Agnes asks if David knows what has happened to Miss Betsey's money; of course, he doesn't yet.<PARAGRAPH>They walk in to David's rooms to find Miss Betsey alone.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, she has been arguing with Mrs. Crupp, who would like Miss Betsey to leave.<PARAGRAPH>But she's calmed down a bit now.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Dick is out with Peggotty looking at the sights of London.<PARAGRAPH>David explains that he tried to cancel his work with Spenlow and Jorkins, but was refused.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey says that was kind of him, but stupid.<PARAGRAPH>She then presents her own personal history (weirdly, in third person).<PARAGRAPH>What has happened is this: Miss Betsey has had a number of secure investments that netted her a lot of money.<PARAGRAPH>However, her business manager (Agnes's father, Mr. Wickfield) hasn't been doing as well with her money as he used to.<PARAGRAPH>So, Miss Betsey got fed up investing through Mr. Wickfield, and decided to try various markets herself.<PARAGRAPH>Unfortunately, this has proved disastrous, and Miss Betsey has lost all of her money.<PARAGRAPH>Agnes seems oddly relieved to hear this news.<PARAGRAPH>David realizes that she had been worrying that Mr. Wickfield had ruined Miss Betsey.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey turns to Agnes and David and asks what she should do.<PARAGRAPH>She can count on about 70 pounds a year in rent money from the cottage (which is about U.S. $7,800 in today's money; see this website).<PARAGRAPH>How is she supposed to keep herself and David alive on that kind of money? (Mr. Dick has his own income, so he's safe.)<PARAGRAPH>David says he's got to do something.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey is worried that David will join the army and get himself killed.<PARAGRAPH>Agnes asks if David has signed a lease for his apartment?<PARAGRAPH>Yes, he has.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey agrees that she has enough cash to pay the rent for the term of his lease \u2013 the next six months.<PARAGRAPH>So, Miss Betsey decides that she will stay with David and they will rent a room for Mr. Dick nearby.<PARAGRAPH>Agnes suggests that, if David has time, he might take on the job of secretary to Dr. Strong.<PARAGRAPH>David is delighted at this news and thanks Agnes for being so helpful.<PARAGRAPH>As Miss Betsey, Peggotty, and Agnes set to work rearranging and tidying David's rooms, Mr. Wickfield and Uriah Heep arrive.<PARAGRAPH>David is absolutely horrified at the change between the two men: Mr. Wickfield now seems totally dependent, basically bowing down to Uriah Heep.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey compliments Agnes's good sense to Mr. Wickfield. She adds that Agnes is worth more than his whole firm.<PARAGRAPH>Uriah Heep chimes in that he'd be happy to see Agnes become a partner.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey shuts him down: she tells Uriah that he's already become a partner himself, and that should be enough for him.<PARAGRAPH>Uriah Heep tells David that he's happy to see David even under such awful circumstances.<PARAGRAPH>David is sure that Uriah is only too happy to see David brought low like this.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey scolds Uriah Heep for jerking around and waving his arms like an eel.<PARAGRAPH>In a dull, forced-sounding voice, Mr. Wickfield claims that anything Uriah Heep says, Mr. Wickfield agrees with.<PARAGRAPH>David is sure that Uriah Heep has made Mr. Wickfield say this to impress David.<PARAGRAPH>Uriah Heep heads out, and Mr. Wickfield and Agnes stay for a chat.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Wickfield brightens up without Uriah Heep's presence.<PARAGRAPH>Agnes and David go out to dinner, along with Mr. Wickfield, and it really is like old times.<PARAGRAPH>David is so moved by Agnes's goodness and kindness that his heart feels stronger for her presence.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200929182814/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/david-copperfield/summary/chapter-35"}
