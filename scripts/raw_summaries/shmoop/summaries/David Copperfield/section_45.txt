{"name": "Chapter 46", "summary": "One night, about a year after his marriage, David is walking home.<PARAGRAPH>He happens to go past Mrs. Steerforth's house.<PARAGRAPH>David sees the blinds drawn and the whole house shut up.<PARAGRAPH>He feels a bit depressed and doesn't notice anyone around him until suddenly, a woman's voice rings out.<PARAGRAPH>It's the voice of Mrs. Steerforth's maid asking David to come in and have a word with Miss Dartle.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Dartle saw David passing and would like him to speak with her.<PARAGRAPH>The maid tells David that Mrs. Steerforth is not well and stays in her room most of the time.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Dartle looks disdainfully at David. She asks if Emily has been found.<PARAGRAPH>She seems pleased to tell David that Emily has run away from Steerforth.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Dartle hopes openly that Emily has died.<PARAGRAPH>The woman asks if David wants to know what is known about Emily's whereabouts?<PARAGRAPH>David answers yes.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Dartle calls to Littimer to come out.<PARAGRAPH>Littimer informs David that he and Steerforth have been abroad with Emily. They have traveled through France, Switzerland, and Italy.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Emily has been quick to learn the languages of these places and has been much admired wherever they went.<PARAGRAPH>Littimer explains that, though they were happy for a time, Emily grew more and more depressed, and her low spirits dragged down Steerforth.<PARAGRAPH>After many arguments, Steerforth finally left Emily in Naples, Italy.<PARAGRAPH>But Steerforth (thinking that he was being generous) offered to arrange a marriage between Emily and another man who wouldn't mind her past indiscretions.<PARAGRAPH>(Hearing Littimer talk about this, both David and Miss Dartle are sure that Littimer is talking about himself.)<PARAGRAPH>Once Littimer explained to Emily that Steerforth had gone away, she tried desperately to kill herself.<PARAGRAPH>(Miss Dartle seems delighted by this news.)<PARAGRAPH>Littimer continues: Emily's behavior was awful, and Littimer was sure that she would murder him if she got the chance.<PARAGRAPH>(David thinks Emily would be quite right to try.)<PARAGRAPH>In the end, Littimer locked her up with nothing at hand to hurt herself or anyone else.<PARAGRAPH>But Emily still managed to escape by knocking the bars out of the window of her room and climbing down the wall.<PARAGRAPH>There has been no news of her since.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Dartle smiles at the thought that she may be dead.<PARAGRAPH>Littimer agrees that Emily may have drowned herself, or she may have found a way to join the local boatmen.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, after Emily's escape, Littimer went to meet with Steerforth.<PARAGRAPH>Steerforth injured Littimer, and so Littimer left Steerforth's service and headed back to England to tell Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle this news (for a sum of money).<PARAGRAPH>Now, Littimer is looking for another job.<PARAGRAPH>All David wants to know is if Emily received a letter from home, or if he and Steerforth intercepted it.<PARAGRAPH>Littimer isn't willing to tell David straight out, but he strongly implies that Steerforth prevented Emily from getting her letter from Mr. Peggotty.<PARAGRAPH>David finishes up by telling Littimer that he plans to tell Mr. Peggotty this story, so Littimer had better watch himself.<PARAGRAPH>Littimer informs David that he is not afraid, and that this is a free country.<PARAGRAPH>Steerforth's servant takes off.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Dartle adds that Steerforth is sailing off the coast of Spain.<PARAGRAPH>She tells David that they share a common goal: David wants Emily saved, and Miss Dartle wants to make sure that Emily never has another chance to hurt Steerforth again.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Steerforth comes up behind Miss Dartle and greets David.<PARAGRAPH>Steerforth's mother reaffirms Miss Dartle's suspicions that Emily is going to try to get something more out of Steerforth.<PARAGRAPH>David respectfully disagrees: Emily, who has been so badly treated, would not accept a cup of water from Steerforth now.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Dartle looks like she wants to say something, but Mrs. Steerforth stops her.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Steerforth asks how David is \u2013 he's starting to get famous, she believes.<PARAGRAPH>David says that he has been lucky to get good reviews.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Steerforth asks if David's mother is alive.<PARAGRAPH>She tells David that it's a shame, because his mother would have been proud of him.<PARAGRAPH>David shakes her hand and leaves.<PARAGRAPH>He now seeks out Mr. Peggotty, who happens to be in London, lodging at that place where Mr. Dick stayed briefly.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Peggotty greets David warmly.<PARAGRAPH>David passes on the news that he has heard from Littimer: that Emily has left Steerforth.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Peggotty asks if David thinks she is still alive?<PARAGRAPH>David thinks she is, and Mr. Peggotty agrees \u2013 he would know if she had died.<PARAGRAPH>David suggests that little Emily might come back to London, having nowhere else to go.<PARAGRAPH>He asks if Mr. Peggotty remembers Martha Endell?<PARAGRAPH>Both David and Mr. Peggotty have seen her on the London streets.<PARAGRAPH>David tells Mr. Peggotty that Emily used to be kind to Martha (before Emily's own disaster).<PARAGRAPH>David suggests that they should look for Martha to see if she might know where Emily is.<PARAGRAPH>As they walk out to search for Martha, David asks after Ham Peggotty.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Ham is still working too hard, but he's popular in the village.<PARAGRAPH>David worries that, if Ham ever finds Steerforth, he might do something dangerous.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Peggotty agrees that he has had similar concerns about Ham.<PARAGRAPH>David and Mr. Peggotty fall silent as they walk towards the lonely figure of a woman: it is Martha.<PARAGRAPH>They follow her through the London streets until she turns down a quiet alley.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200929182814/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/david-copperfield/summary/chapter-46"}
