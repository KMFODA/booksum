{"name": "Chapter 41", "summary": "David gets a reply from Dora's aunts: they ask him to come and meet them, and to bring a friend.<PARAGRAPH>He replies that it would be an honor and invites Traddles.<PARAGRAPH>David is disappointed because his old confidant, Miss Mills, has gone to India with her father.<PARAGRAPH>He worries endlessly over what to wear.<PARAGRAPH>David feels a little annoyed (though he loves Traddles) that his companion for the day keeps brushing his hair so weirdly.<PARAGRAPH>Traddles apologizes: his hair just won't stay down.<PARAGRAPH>Traddles's hair has given him a lot of trouble: his girlfriend, Sophy, doesn't mind it, but her oldest sister, \"the Beauty,\" does.<PARAGRAPH>Sophy is so necessary to her family that, when Traddles asks her parents if he can marry Sophy, Sophy's mother (Mrs. Crewler) faints.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, her father (the Reverend Horace Crewler) agrees.<PARAGRAPH>But Sophy's sister Sarah (who has some sort of problem with her spine) eats nothing but toast and water for two days at the news.<PARAGRAPH>They've all become resigned to it, but they all resent Traddles for taking Sophy away from them.<PARAGRAPH>Traddles and David arrive at the home of the Missses Spenlow.<PARAGRAPH>David feels like he's on display.<PARAGRAPH>He looks around for Dora, but doesn't see her \u2013 though he does hear the sound of Jip somewhere.<PARAGRAPH>The two Miss Spenlows are older than Mr. Spenlow was.<PARAGRAPH>The younger of the two, Miss Clarissa, addresses David \u2013 she thinks \u2013 but she's actually looking at Traddles.<PARAGRAPH>David corrects her mistake, but he feels weird right off the bat.<PARAGRAPH>The older of the two sisters, Miss Lavinia, is supposed to be experienced in the ways of the heart.<PARAGRAPH>This experience arises from a (possibly imaginary) relationship Miss Lavinia had long ago with a Mr. Pidger.<PARAGRAPH>Dora's aunts acknowledge that, with their brother's death, Dora's position in the world has changed.<PARAGRAPH>They also agree that David seems genuinely to love Dora.<PARAGRAPH>(There's a little digression about the source of the quarrel between Lavinia, Clarissa, and Mr. Spenlow: apparently, the issue was that Mr. Spenlow's wife didn't find room for the Dora's aunts at a dinner party long before.)<PARAGRAPH>(Miss Clarissa adds that it was no problem at all if Mr. and Mrs. Spenlow wanted to have their own friends; she and Lavinia could make do on their own, she's sure.)<PARAGRAPH>Miss Clarissa and Miss Lavinia are both undecided about what to do with David, since young love is so uncertain.<PARAGRAPH>David and Traddles both chime in to talk about how honest and faithful David has been with his love for Dora.<PARAGRAPH>The Spenlow sisters seem impressed with Traddles because he is a lawyer.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Lavinia asks Traddles to confirm that David's love is the real thing.<PARAGRAPH>She then tells Traddles that they want to put these feelings to the test by getting to know David.<PARAGRAPH>Still directing her attention to Traddles and not David, Miss Lavinia clarifies that these visits will be to Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa, not to Dora.<PARAGRAPH>Dora's aunts don't want an official engagement between David and Dora yet.<PARAGRAPH>Traddles agrees that this is reasonable and considerate, and David chimes in positively.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Lavinia also makes David promise that he won't try to contact Dora secretly outside of these visits.<PARAGRAPH>David promises happily.<PARAGRAPH>But Miss Lavinia insists that David talk over these conditions with Traddles for fifteen minutes before he agrees.<PARAGRAPH>So, they leave David and Traddles alone for a quarter of an hour, they come back, and David still agrees to all of their terms.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Clarissa invites David to come to dinner at 3 PM every Sunday, and to tea twice a week at 6:30 PM.<PARAGRAPH>They would also like to meet Miss Betsey Trotwood.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Lavinia guides David into the house to see Dora, who has been listening at the door.<PARAGRAPH>Dora tells David that she's frightened of his friend and wants him to leave \u2013 she's talking about Traddles, and she thinks he has no business being there.<PARAGRAPH>David pleads that Traddles is the best guy around.<PARAGRAPH>He also tells her that Miss Betsey will be visiting soon, but Dora doesn't want to meet her either.<PARAGRAPH>The two of them play with Jip and (as usual) avoid practical matters.<PARAGRAPH>David suggests that Dora come and meet Traddles, but she runs off to her room and locks herself in instead.<PARAGRAPH>Traddles congratulates David: he's sure that David will be married long before Traddles himself will.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey is pleased to see David so happy, but David notices that she paces back and forth in her room almost until dawn.<PARAGRAPH>David also writes to Agnes to thank her for advice, and she replies happily.<PARAGRAPH>He gets even busier than usual, with lots of work and now these extra visits to Highgate.<PARAGRAPH>David is relieved to see that Miss Betsey seems to be getting along with the Spenlow sisters, even though they think Miss Betsey is a bit eccentric.<PARAGRAPH>Sadly, Jip hates Miss Betsey, and growls whenever he sees her.<PARAGRAPH>The one thing that does worry David is that everyone seems willing to treat Dora like a toy or a doll.<PARAGRAPH>He brings it up with her one afternoon, telling her that, after all, Dora isn't a child.<PARAGRAPH>David tells her that she could still be happy and treated as an adult.<PARAGRAPH>Dora starts to cry and tells David that he shouldn't find fault with her.<PARAGRAPH>Dora eventually asks him to show her that cookbook he wanted her to learn.<PARAGRAPH>But she gets a headache from reading the cookbook, and trying to learn to add and subtract makes her cry.<PARAGRAPH>David asks her, if they were married and he wanted an Irish stew for dinner, if she would know what to do.<PARAGRAPH>Dora answers that she would ask the servant for one.<PARAGRAPH>So, David and Dora go back to being happy with playing their guitar and songs and painting flowers.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200929182814/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/david-copperfield/summary/chapter-41"}
