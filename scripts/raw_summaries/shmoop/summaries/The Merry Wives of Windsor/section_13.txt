{"name": "Act 4, Scene 2", "summary": "Falstaff show up at the Ford house and starts to sweet talk Mistress Ford.<PARAGRAPH>He's worried that her husband will show up, so Mistress Ford promises him that her husband's out bird hunting with his pals.<PARAGRAPH>Then Mistress Page shows up (as planned) and Falstaff hides in the next room.<PARAGRAPH>Mistress Page acts like she doesn't know Falstaff is hiding and pretend-warns her friend that Master Ford is on his way home to catch his wife cheating.<PARAGRAPH>Mistress Ford is all \"Oh, no! Falstaff is here. What are we going to do?!\"<PARAGRAPH>Falstaff wants to run away, but Mistress Page says that Ford's brothers are guarding the doors with pistols\u2014there's no escape.<PARAGRAPH>Falstaff refuses to climb back inside the stinky \"buck-basket\" and offers to hide in the chimney.<PARAGRAPH>Instead, the housewives convince Falstaff that he should put on a bunch of women's clothes and pretend to be the \"fat woman of Brentford.\"<PARAGRAPH>Brain Snack: Gillian of Brentford (aka \"the old woman of Brentford\") is a popular English folk figure who appears in a lot of comedies. She's most famous for leaving her friends \"a score of farts\" in her will (source).<PARAGRAPH>Mistress Page declares that they'll teach Falstaff and Ford a lesson they won't soon forget. Then she utters the most famous lines in the play: \"wives may be merry and yet honest, too.\" (Translation: Housewives can be fun-loving, practical jokers\u2014and maybe even flirt a little\u2014but that doesn't mean they're not faithful to their husbands.)<PARAGRAPH>Ford bursts into the room like a maniac and screams at the servants to drop the \"buck-basket.\"<PARAGRAPH>While he riffles through the dirty laundry, his friends urge him to stop acting like a total psycho.<PARAGRAPH>Mistress Ford sweetly tells her husband that her maid's aunt (the \"old woman of Brentford\") is visiting.<PARAGRAPH>Ford flips out and screams that he's forbidden that old \"witch\" from entering his home. He even grabs a cudgel to hit her with when he sees her. (Hmm. Starting to wonder why Ford hates women so much? Go to \"Themes: Gender\" for more on this.)<PARAGRAPH>Falstaff comes down the stairs in his old woman disguise. (Think Tyler Perry as \"Madea.\")<PARAGRAPH>Ford goes nuts, beats the \"old woman,\" calls \"her\" a bunch of names, and chases \"her\" out the door.<PARAGRAPH>Ford's friends don't know the \"old woman\" is actually Falstaff but they stand around and watch anyway. (This usually gets a big laugh from audiences but we have to confess that's we're a little freaked out when Ford beats up someone he thinks is an old lady.)<PARAGRAPH>Mistress Page and Mistress Ford think it's hilarious that Falstaff was beaten \"most pitifully,\" and they decide to 'fess us to their husbands.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219173213/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/merry-wives-of-windsor/summary/act-4-scene-2"}
