The mysterious man on the hill is none other than Holmes.<PARAGRAPH>Watson gets upset when he realizes that Holmes has been deliberately keeping him in the dark.<PARAGRAPH>And what about all those reports, which he so carefully wrote up and sent off to London?<PARAGRAPH>Holmes tries to make nice.<PARAGRAPH>He says he trusts Watson completely. But he also worried that Watson wouldn't have been able to resist making contact with Holmes on the moors.<PARAGRAPH>And Holmes has been getting the reports\u2014he arranged to have them delivered back to him on the moors from London.<PARAGRAPH>Holmes is fascinated by Watson's account of his conversation with Laura Lyons.<PARAGRAPH>Holmes knows that Stapleton and Laura Lyons have been hooking up.<PARAGRAPH>Holmes drops another bombshell: Beryl is actually Mrs. Stapleton. She's his wife, not his sister!<PARAGRAPH>Stapleton is the one who followed Sir Henry in London, and Beryl's the one who sent that warning to Sir Henry at his hotel.<PARAGRAPH>Holmes knows that Stapleton's pose as an unmarried man helped him enlist Laura in his plotting.<PARAGRAPH>And Laura's desperate for divorce money now because she believes that she can marry him.<PARAGRAPH>Holmes is almost ready to charge Stapleton with murder.<PARAGRAPH>But he needs Watson to wait at Baskerville Hall with Sir Henry for at least another day or two.<PARAGRAPH>Just as Holmes says this, they hear a horrible scream over the moors, followed by the growling of a dog.<PARAGRAPH>Holmes fears that they may be too late.<PARAGRAPH>At the side of a cliff, they find a body with a crushed skull.<PARAGRAPH>It's Sir Henry Baskerville.<PARAGRAPH>Besides feeling guilty that they were on the moors and still failed to save Sir Henry, Holmes is deeply frustrated.<PARAGRAPH>Even though Holmes and Watson are both sure that Stapleton is involved with the Hound murders, there's no definite proof linking him to the Baskerville deaths.<PARAGRAPH>Holmes goes over to the body to carry it to the hall.<PARAGRAPH>But suddenly, he starts dancing around and shaking Watson's hand.<PARAGRAPH>It's not Sir Henry at all! The body has a beard!<PARAGRAPH>(Um\u2014it may not be Sir Henry, but it's still a corpse with a shattered skull\u2026 is dancing the appropriate thing here?)<PARAGRAPH>In fact, the body belongs to Selden.<PARAGRAPH>Watson remembers that Sir Henry gave some of his old clothes to Barrymore; Barrymore probably passed them on to Selden.<PARAGRAPH>Stapleton's dog has obviously been trained to react to Sir Henry's smell, which lead him to attack Selden in Sir Henry's clothes.<PARAGRAPH>They see someone smoking and strolling towards them: it's Stapleton.<PARAGRAPH>Stapleton turns pale when he sees the body, since he realizes that it's not Sir Henry.<PARAGRAPH>Stapleton claims he invited Sir Henry to walk over to Merripit House and then got worried when he never turned up.<PARAGRAPH>Stapleton asks suspiciously if anybody heard the sounds of a dog, since the moors are supposed to be haunted.<PARAGRAPH>Neither Holmes nor Watson gives any sign that they might know why Stapleton's so interested in this mysterious dog.<PARAGRAPH>Watson claims to believe that Selden died from madness and stress, which drove him over a cliff.<PARAGRAPH>Holmes also pretends that he plans to go back to London the next day, since this has \"not been a satisfactory case\" (12.133).", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508135841/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/hound-of-the-baskervilles/summary/chapter-12"}
