{"name": "Act 2, Scene 1", "summary": "Elsewhere in the Greek camp, Ajax yells at his slave Thersites, who ignores him and talks smack about what it would be like if Agamemnon had a bunch of nasty, oozing boils and skin ulcers.<PARAGRAPH>(Gross! But go to \"Symbols\" if you want to know what's up with all the talk about disease and decay.)<PARAGRAPH>Ajax is enraged when his slave blows him off. He asks him if he's deaf and calls him a bunch of names like \"dog,\" \"b****-wolf's son,\" \"Toadstool,\" \"cobloaf,\" and so on.<PARAGRAPH>(Hey, quick brain snack: a \"cob loaf\" is an ugly, misshapen piece of bread; a \"toadstool\" is a poisonous mushroom.\"<PARAGRAPH>Also\u2014hmm. Looks like the Greek camp  really is in chaos and disorder.)<PARAGRAPH>Just in case Thersites doesn't know he's in trouble, Ajax beats him... repeatedly.<PARAGRAPH>What does Thersites do? He eggs on Ajax and encourages the guy to beat him some more.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Thersites calls Ajax an idiot and insists that when it comes to trash-talk, Thersites totally owns him.<PARAGRAPH>Tired of lazing about in their tent, Achilles and Patroclus show up and want to know what's going on.<PARAGRAPH>We find out that Ajax wants Thersites to find out about a proclamation that's just been issued, but Thersites refuses.<PARAGRAPH>Thersites keeps talking smack to his master and gets into a spat with Achilles. Then he storms off.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, Achilles knows what's up. He tells Ajax that the proclamation is about the lottery to see who's going to throw down with Hector.<PARAGRAPH>Achilles brags that if there wasn't going to be a lottery, he'd be the guy chosen to fight, since he's so awesome.<PARAGRAPH>Ajax is all, \"whatever, man.\"<PARAGRAPH>But hey! It looks like the plot might work.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219191630/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/troilus-cressida/summary/act-2-scene-1"}
