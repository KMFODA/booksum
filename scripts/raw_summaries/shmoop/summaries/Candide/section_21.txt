{"name": "Chapter 22", "summary": "Candide and Martin travel toward Venice. Candide wants to make a detour to Paris since he has heard it praised (except by Martin, who hates everything).<PARAGRAPH>Candide feels a little sick from his journey. Because everyone can see that he\u2019s rich, attendees quickly surround him to treat his illness.<PARAGRAPH>Because their medicine involves making Candide vomit and bleed, he becomes gradually sicker before ultimately recovering.<PARAGRAPH>Candide gambles and is astounded when he loses. Martin is not at all surprised.<PARAGRAPH>Candide goes to the theater and meets an Abb\u00e9 (the French word for abbot). He asks him how many \"theatrical pieces\" exist in France.<PARAGRAPH>The Abb\u00e9 tells him there are about five or six thousand (\"Wow!\" says Candide) and that about fifteen are good (\"Wow!\" says Martin).<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, one of the actresses, a Mademoiselle Clairon, reminds Candide of Cun\u00e9gonde.<PARAGRAPH>The Cun\u00e9gonde look-alike impresses him, and the Abb\u00e9 offers to introduce him to her.<PARAGRAPH>When that doesn\u2019t work (Clairon was either busy or uninterested), the Abb\u00e9 arranges for Candide and Martin to meet another woman called the Marchioness of Parolignac. (Note: at least one edition calls her the Marchioness of Doublestakesworth.)<PARAGRAPH>Candide gambles and is not concerned with his substantial loss of money.<PARAGRAPH>Over dinner, a scholar discusses literature and, in particular, tragedies. He tells us what makes great literature so great. This is interesting, and we suggest you flag this page in your book.<PARAGRAPH>Candide, after some inquiry, finds out that the scholar is brilliant and wrote a book that didn\u2019t sell so well. Candide declares him a wonderful man, a \"second Pangloss.\"<PARAGRAPH>Candide asks the scholar his opinion on the goodness of the universe. The scholar responds that he finds that things exist in a perpetual state of annoyance and disagreement with one another.<PARAGRAPH>Martin and Candide exchange more philosophical banter about whether absolute necessity is compatible with free will.<PARAGRAPH>The Marchioness of Parolignac seduces Candide, despite his stated dedication to Cun\u00e9gonde. Sex follows.<PARAGRAPH>After the sex, the Marchioness praises Candide\u2019s rings (which were part of the mass of treasure he brought from El Dorado); Candide allows her to keep them.<PARAGRAPH>The Abb\u00e9, who is a conniving fraud, pries Candide for information about Cun\u00e9gonde. He forges a letter from Cun\u00e9gonde to Candide, informing Candide that she is in France.<PARAGRAPH>When Candide receives the letter, he immediately leaves for her supposed hotel. Once in Cun\u00e9gonde\u2019s room, an officer arrives and threatens to arrest them.<PARAGRAPH>Quickly, Martin and Candide realize they\u2019ve been set up.<PARAGRAPH>Candide bribes the officer with some diamonds. Since bribes seem to be working, he gets the officer\u2019s brother to arrange a ship to England.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201024064035/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/candide/summary/chapter-22"}
