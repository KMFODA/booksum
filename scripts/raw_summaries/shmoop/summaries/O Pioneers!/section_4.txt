{"name": "Part 1, Chapter 5", "summary": "The chapter begins just as Emil and Alexandra are done with their trip to the river territory and are heading back to the Divide.<PARAGRAPH>They spent five days there, and Alexandra has learned a lot\nfrom talking to the farmers. But she doesn't see any reason for her family to\nmove there.<PARAGRAPH>Emil wonders why his sister looks so cheerful on the ride\nhome.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator comments that this might be the first time\nanyone looked upon this country with \"love and yearning\" (1.5.3). The\n\"Genius of the Divide\" has begun to bend to Alexandra's will.<PARAGRAPH>Later, Alexandra meets with her whole family to report on\nwhat she's seen in the river country. She tells them her new idea: rather than\nselling their property and moving, they should mortgage their farm and buy up as\nmuch property as possible, starting with the Linstrum land.<PARAGRAPH>Lou flips out when he hears Alexandra suggests that they\nwork to pay off another mortgage. Oscar is bewildered.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra starts to get nervous, but stands her ground. She\ninsists that the land will pay for itself in time.<PARAGRAPH>When Lou doesn't believe her, she tells him that she knows the land will\nmake them rich. She can \"feel it coming\" (1.5.10). Call it Farmer\nESP.<PARAGRAPH>Oscar, sounding defeated, says he doesn't know how they're\nsupposed to work all that land.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra assures him that they won't have to work the land\nthemselves; none of the rich landowners farm their own land. She wants her\nbrothers to be independent landowners, not farm laborers, and she hopes Emil\nwill be able to go to college.<PARAGRAPH>When Lou still thinks she's crazy, and asks her why no one\nelse is doing what she suggests, Alexandra reminds him that they descend from\nbetter people than their neighbors, and that they owe it to themselves to try.<PARAGRAPH>Dinner ends, and they all go their separate ways.<PARAGRAPH>A while later, Alexandra finds Oscar looking down in the\ndumps by the windmill.<PARAGRAPH>She tells him he doesn't have to do anything he doesn't\nwant. His biggest hang-up is agreeing to take on more debt.<PARAGRAPH>After Oscar takes off, Alexandra stays and looks at the\nstars, thinking about how much this land is part of her, and she is part of it.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-1-chapter-5"}
