{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 3", "summary": "Well, it turns out Ivar's problems aren't over. While Emil is away at Am\u00e9d\u00e9e's wedding in the French country, Alexandra invites herbrothers over for a family dinner. (Emil hates family gatherings, so it's\nbetter that he's away.) Check out what happens.<PARAGRAPH>But, first things first. The narrator tells us a little\nabout the setting and the characters present at Alexandra's dinner.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra had her dining room designed by a Hanover\nfurniture dealer. It looks like a display window, and has enough useless\nobjects and china to satisfy the expectations of society. Alexandra doesn't\nreally see the point, though.<PARAGRAPH>Oscar's there with his four boys. Oscar and Lou are pretty\nmuch unchanged. Lou looks older than his brother and Oscar still doesn't look\ntoo bright, even though he makes more money than Lou.<PARAGRAPH>Something about Lou seems untrustworthy, and people tend to\nthink he's \"tricky\" (2.3.2). Of course, the narrator notes dryly,\nthat makes him perfect for politics, and he's gotten himself quite involved on\nthat front.<PARAGRAPH>Lou's wife, Annie, is preoccupied with her appearance and\nher fine clothes. She's come to look sharper and more aggressive, just like her\nhusband.<PARAGRAPH>They all speak English at the table, since Oscar's wife\ndoesn't speak Swedish and is ashamed of having married a foreigner. Annie is\nherself ashamed of speaking the old language. Oscar has an accent, but Lou\nsounds native.<PARAGRAPH>Lou says he has spoken with the superintendent of an insane\nasylum, who claims that Ivar could become dangerous if he's not committed.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra dismisses this, saying Ivar probably has \"more\nsense\" than her farmhands (2.3.6).<PARAGRAPH>Lou isn't satisfied with that. He still thinks Ivar could\nset fire to the barn, or come after the girls with an axe. Alexandra laughs\nthis off.<PARAGRAPH>Lou reminds her that if one of their neighbors complains, he'll\nbe taken away by force.<PARAGRAPH>In that case, Alexandra tells him, she'll take them to\ncourt.<PARAGRAPH>Annie takes it up with Alexandra, saying that Ivar makes\npeople keep their distance from Alexandra. Her daughter, Milly, is scared of\nIvar.<PARAGRAPH>Milly, who resembles old Mrs. Bergson, smiles at Alexandra\nand Alexandra winks back at her.<PARAGRAPH>Ivar, says Alexandra, has as much a right as anyone to dress\nand act as he wishes. But she agrees to keep him at home from now on. She\nchanges the subject by asking them about their new bathtub.<PARAGRAPH>After Annie raves about the tub, Alexandra says she's\nthinking about getting one for Ivar and putting it in the barn. But not before\nshe buys Milly a piano.<PARAGRAPH>Oscar gets angry, saying she can just continue playing the\norgan in church. He's often jealous of the things Alexandra does for Lou's\nchildren.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra explains that playing the organ all the time is\nbad news for Milly's technique. So says her piano teacher.<PARAGRAPH>When Oscar scoffs at this again, Annie announces that Milly\nwants to play piano at her commencement next year.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra agrees that Milly deserves a piano, and remembers\nwhen Milly learned all the old Swedish songs that her father used to sing.<PARAGRAPH>Milly and her younger sister, Stella, both look at a picture\nof John Bergson hanging on the wall in the sitting room. Alexandra had it made\nfrom a photograph taken of her father just before he left Sweden.<PARAGRAPH>Dinner's over. Lou and Oscar go out to pick cherries (they\ndon't bother to grow an orchard themselves, the narrator tells us) and Annie\ngoes to talk with the maids, to see if she can find out more about how\nAlexandra keeps up her household.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra goes with her three nieces into the flower garden.\nJust as they're walking among the flowerbeds, a horse drawn buggy pulls up. A\nsmartly dressed man steps out and the young girls are delighted.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger approaches and asks Alexandra whether she\nrecognizes him or not.<PARAGRAPH>When Alexandra realizes that it's Carl Linstrum, she throws\nout her hands and runs toward him.<PARAGRAPH>Carl steps through the gate. He tells her how little she's\nchanged, and asks for a place to stay overnight. It turns out he's left his\nstuff in Hanover and is only staying for a few days, before he heads off again\nfor the coast.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra \"blushes\" when she remarks how much\ndifferent Carl seems with a beard (2.3.27).<PARAGRAPH>When Alexandra asks whether it's possible for him to stay a\nbit longer, he admits that he's in a bit of a hurry to find his fortune in\nAlaska.<PARAGRAPH>She asks him if he's going to Alaska to \"paint the\nIndians.\"<PARAGRAPH>When he reminds her that he's an engraver, not a painting,\nshe recalls the paintings she has of his hanging on her walls.<PARAGRAPH>He interrupts her, calling those painting \"water-color\nsketches\" (2.3.34). As he surveys her rich property, he tells Alexandra\nhow disappointed he is in himself and his lack of imagination, for leaving Nebraska\nall those years ago.<PARAGRAPH>Lou and Oscar come up the hill and Alexandra calls them\nover. They're in no hurry to see who's there.<PARAGRAPH>When they see that it's Carl, they're hardly any friendlier,\nand frankly, seem suspicious.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra explains that Carl's on his way to Alaska to\nstrike it rich. The brothers ask whether he's gone into business before.<PARAGRAPH>Carl hasn't, but he's definitely fed up with the engraver's\nlife. He's planning to meet up with a friend of his from New York who's had\nsome success in Alaska.<PARAGRAPH>As the conversation continues, we find out that Carl is\nplanning to spend the winter in Seattle before heading up to Alaska in the\nspring. It's been sixteen years since Carl left, and Marie Shabata now lives on\nhis family's old property with her husband Frank. Alexandra never let them plow\nover the Linstrums' old sod house.<PARAGRAPH>Annie Lee comes out from the house, wishing she was wearing\nsomething nicer, and is excited to see such an urban visitor. She talks loudly\nand embarrasses Milly by telling Carl he'd better wait to marry her.<PARAGRAPH>Carl likes Milly, and notices that how much she resembles\nMrs. Bergson, her grandmother. He asks whether Milly has the run of the land,\nlike Annie and Alexandra did when they were young.<PARAGRAPH>Annie explains that Milly has it very different, that she\ngoes to school and that the family is planning to rent the farm and move into\ntown as soon as the girls are old enough to look for husbands. Annie leaves to\ngather up her things.<PARAGRAPH>Lou turns to Carl and asks him what his thoughts are on William Jennings Bryan, a politician from the\nera who championed the wisdom of common people. (See \"Shout Outs\" for\nmore on this guy.) He starts to get flustered as he talks politics, saying, \"the\nWest is going to make itself heard\" (2.3.55).<PARAGRAPH>Carl laughs Lou's seriousness off, but Lou only gets\nangrier, saying that city people like Carl ought to go down to Wall Street and \"dynamite\nit\" (2.3.57).<PARAGRAPH>At first, Carl is at a loss for words. He asks Lou what he\nhas to complain about, with all the success they're experiencing now.<PARAGRAPH>Lou sounds threatening but vague when he says that they have\na lot more to say now than when they were poor.<PARAGRAPH>Annie returns with Ivar and a double carriage, and Carl goes\nto help.<PARAGRAPH>Lou asks Alexandra why Carl has returned. She figures it's\njust to pay them a visit, and she admits that he didn't let her know ahead of\ntime.<PARAGRAPH>Both Lou and Oscar agree that he doesn't seem to have made\nmuch of himself.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra leaves them to see Annie off. Lou joins her in the\nwagon and Oscar takes off, too.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-2-chapter-3"}
