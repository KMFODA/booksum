He avoids making eye contact with Alexandra, and she assumes that he's decided to takeoff.<PARAGRAPH>Carl confirms. He's sad that she's surrounded by such \"little\nmen,\" including himself (2.12.5). He's heading off tomorrow. He says he\ncan't promise that he'll return with something more to offer.<PARAGRAPH>But, Alexandra responds, money is not something she needs.\nShe's loaded. What she needs is him. She doesn't even know why she has all her\nmoney, if she has no one to be with.<PARAGRAPH>Carl says it's not just that he can't give her anything. It's\nthat he can't live with himself as a man with no means of his own. He needs to\ngo make his own money.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra has a feeling he won't come back if they don't act now. Something could happen to them in the meantime.<PARAGRAPH>Carl refuses. He has to go up North. He asks Alexandra to\nwait for him for a year.<PARAGRAPH>They both look at the portrait of John Bergson. Alexandra\nsays she's glad she can't see him now, when she has become prosperous but is\nlosing the people who matter to her, first Emil, and now Carl.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-2-chapter-12"}
