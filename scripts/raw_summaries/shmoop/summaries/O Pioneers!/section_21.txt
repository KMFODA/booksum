{"name": "Part 4, Chapter 3", "summary": "One week later, and Emil is busy packing up his books. He is getting ready to go study law with a Swedish lawyer in Omaha, before enrolling in law school in Michigan.<PARAGRAPH>He's not exactly enthusiastic about leaving. It feels like\nhe's finally leaving home once and for all, and embarking on adulthood.<PARAGRAPH>But still, he doesn't yet have a clear picture what that\nwill mean for him. At least, he thinks, he's pleasing his sister this way.<PARAGRAPH>He decides to rest for a bit and chat with Alexandra. When\nhe looks at her, he sees for the first time that she's an attractive woman, in\naddition to being a sister. Marie was the first person to point this out to\nhim.<PARAGRAPH>They start talking about their father, John Bergson, and\ntheir grandfather, who squandered all his fortune on a young woman. Alexandra\ntells Emil about all the letters their father used to write to his friends back\nin Sweden, and the plans he initially had to go back to Sweden and pay back the\nsailors who had lost money due to his father's extravagance.<PARAGRAPH>She goes on to explain that their father wasn't like their\nbrothers\u2014he was quiet, intelligent, and wanted to make something of himself.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra is glad to be able to talk proudly about their\nfather. She knows that Emil is ashamed of his brothers, and that the only thing\nthat would have pleased them is if Emil failed out of school. They resent\neverything about the different upbringing he has enjoyed.<PARAGRAPH>She continues telling Emil about John Bergson. When he was a\nyoung man in Stockholm, he used to sing in a male chorus. Alexandra used to go with\nher mother to watch him perform.<PARAGRAPH>Emil turns the conversation back to his brothers. He\nbelieves they would be happier if they were poor. He complains about the\nSwedes\u2014he thinks they're ignorant and self-satisfied, with no curiosity about\nthe world.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra reminds him to be fair to the Swedes. His father\nand uncle weren't like that, and neither were his brothers, when they were\nyounger.<PARAGRAPH>As she looks at Emil, Alexandra is satisfied with him, happy\nthat he has finally found his path in life.<PARAGRAPH>Before Emil heads up to his bedroom to go to sleep, he asks\nher if she remembers the duck they saw once down by the river. She says she\noften thinks about it.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-4-chapter-3"}
