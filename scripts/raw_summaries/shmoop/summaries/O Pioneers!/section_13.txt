{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 9", "summary": "About a month after his arrival, Carl rides with Emil to the French country for a Catholic fair.\u00a0Carl spends much of the time in the basement of the church, the narrator tellsus, and talks with Marie Shabata.<PARAGRAPH>Emil is walking with his friend Am\u00e9d\u00e9e back to the church,\nafter a practice baseball game. Am\u00e9d\u00e9e is described as a small, plucky young\nman, who has recently married Ang\u00e9lique.<PARAGRAPH>The two of them are discussing the game. Emil tells Am\u00e9d\u00e9e\nthat he's pitching better than ever, and Am\u00e9d\u00e9e chocks it up to being recently\nmarried. He tells Emil that he'd better get married, too.<PARAGRAPH>Emil laughs, and says he's not sure how he's supposed to get\nmarried when he doesn't have anyone to marry.<PARAGRAPH>Am\u00e9d\u00e9e tells him he should marry one of the French girls,\nand starts to name a few. Am\u00e9d\u00e9e laughs and asks whether Emil wants to be a\npriest, or something. He's 22 years old and still hasn't had a girlfriend.<PARAGRAPH>Am\u00e9d\u00e9e asks whether Emil has a fancy lady friend in the\ncity, and even when Emil pretends it's possible, his friend can tell he's\nlying. Am\u00e9d\u00e9e jokes that he better tell the French girls to stay away from him,\nbecause he doesn't seem to have a heart.<PARAGRAPH>When they reach the church, they decide to pole vault\nagainst each other, even though Emil is taller and better at the sport. Not\nsurprisingly, Emil does much better, but stops after a short while, saying he\ndoesn't want to spoil his appetite.<PARAGRAPH>Ang\u00e9lique returns, proclaiming that, even if Emil can jump\nhigher, it's only because he's taller, and she thinks Am\u00e9d\u00e9e is much more\ngraceful.<PARAGRAPH>Emil kisses her on the mouth, as she laughs and calls out\nfor help. He laughs that Am\u00e9d\u00e9e is too small to rescue her from him. He doesn't\nlet her go until he catches a furious glare from Marie.<PARAGRAPH>All the same, Emil is delighted by his friend's happiness.\nAs the narrator tells us, he and Am\u00e9d\u00e9e had been friends since they were 12\nyears old. Now, Emil thinks it's strange how his friend has had such good\nfortune, when he's so unhappy.<PARAGRAPH>It's like two rows of corn, Emil thinks. Sometimes one\nthrives, while the other dies, and nobody can tell why.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-2-chapter-9"}
