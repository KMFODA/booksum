{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 2", "summary": "When Emil gets home, his sister is at the kitchen table, eating with her farmhands. The three Swedish girls are running around, servingthe men, but also getting in each other's way and giggling. Alexandra could do\ntheir work herself, if she had too, but she likes having the girls around to\nkeep her company when Emil is off at school.<PARAGRAPH>One of the girls, Signa, seems to be the object of affection\nfor one of Alexandra's farmhands, Nelse Jensen. But since he makes no sign of\nit to anyone, it's anyone's guess what whether he'll ever propose to her.<PARAGRAPH>Old man Ivar is also sitting at Alexandra's table. He lost\nhis land through mismanagement, and Alexandra took him in. He looks after the\nlivestock. Since he doesn't like living the way most people do, Alexandra has\ngiven him space in the barn, where he feels more comfortable with the horses.\nThat way, as he says in his characteristic way, he's \"further from\ntemptations\" (2.2.3).<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra hasn't changed much in all these years. She is\njust as levelheaded as she was as a young girl. Her face is suntanned, but when\nshe pushes back her sleeves, her skin is smooth and fair.<PARAGRAPH>Two of the farmhands are unhappy about the silo Alexandra\nhad installed, saying that her brother Lou is also against it. Alexandra\ninsists calmly that everything is worth a try. One of the farmhands, an\nIrishman, heads out with Emil to inspect the silo.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra and Ivar move to the sitting room, because he has\nsomething to tell her. He still doesn't speak English, and addresses Alexandra\nin his old-fashioned Norwegian.<PARAGRAPH>Ivar complains to her that people have been talking about\nhim, saying that Alexandra should send him away to an insane asylum. They hate\nthem because they fear him, he is different and because he has \"visions.\"\nThey fear that he might do someone harm during one of his \"spells\" (2.2.18).\nIn the Old Country, he tells her, there were many people like him who had been \"touched\nby God\" (2.2.21). But here, people like him get locked away.<PARAGRAPH>As Ivar talks, he seems to feel better. Alexandra knows from\nexperience that listening to what Ivar has to say often brings him out of one\nof his spells.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra really gets how Ivar feels. She jokes that, especially\nafter the recent incident with the silo, the locals might be taking her off to the\nasylum, too. But seriously, she tells him, ignore the haters. Be true to you.<PARAGRAPH>Ivar humbly agrees not to bring this up with her again. He\npromises to keep washing his feet, as Alexandra has instructed him. Because he\nrefuses to wear shoes, they get pretty dirty.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra laughs and tells him not to worry so much about\nhis feet. Back when times were tough, a lot of people went around barefoot. Old\nMrs. Lee, mother of Annie (who's now married to Lou), probably wishes she could\nstill go around barefoot.<PARAGRAPH>Ivar tells Alexandra a story about old Mrs. Lee. In fact, he\nalmost whispers it. Last time he was at Lou's place, old Mrs. Lee showed him\ntheir huge porcelain tub, for bathing. The woman hates the thing, and still\nwashes herself secretly in a little wooden tub she keeps under her bed.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra laughs again, and says she should bring Mrs. Lee\nover to her place and start an asylum for old people who prefer the old ways.<PARAGRAPH>Ivar takes off, saying how happy he is to have gotten this\noff his chest.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra asks him to hitch a horse up to her carriage so\nshe can go into town to meet a potential customer for her alfalfa hay.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-2-chapter-2"}
