{"name": "Part 4, Chapter 7", "summary": "Frank gets home that night and finds Emil's horse in the stable. He goes through the house, but finds no one.<PARAGRAPH>Becoming more and more angry, he gets his shotgun, a\nWinchester 405.<PARAGRAPH>As he leaves the house, the narrator notes, he has no\nintention of using his weapon at all. He doesn't really believe he has any\nreason to do so. He only wants to feel \"like a desperate man\" (4.7.2).<PARAGRAPH>Frank stops before going into the orchard, and then decides\nto go back to the road, where a dense hedge conceals the orchard.<PARAGRAPH>As he goes there, he wonders to himself why Emil would have\nleft his horse in the stable.<PARAGRAPH>At the corner where the hedge ends and the wheat field\nbegins, Frank stops again. He hears some noise, a murmuring noise, like \"water\ncoming from a spring\" (4.7.4).<PARAGRAPH>He parts the leaves of the hedge and peers through. There,\nhe sees Emil lying in the grass with a woman, whom, for a second, he thinks\nmight be one of Alexandra's farm girls.<PARAGRAPH>But it's only a second. He hears a second murmuring, more\ndistinct than the first, and he acts mechanically. He grabs his shotgun and\nfires three times without stopping.<PARAGRAPH>The two fall away from each other, and Emil lies completely\nstill, except for spasms in his hand. But Marie is still alive, crying and\ntrying to crawl toward the hedge.<PARAGRAPH>Frank drops his gun and runs, hearing the cries fade, as it\nsounds like Marie begins to choke.<PARAGRAPH>He drops to his knees, and hears a moan from behind the\nhedge. Groaning and praying himself, he runs into the house, where he's used to\nbeing comforted when he's angry or in a \"frenzy\" (4.7.15).<PARAGRAPH>That's when he realizes that he's killed someone, that a\nwoman is bleeding to death in the orchard, and\u2026 that the woman is his wife.<PARAGRAPH>Frank often gets himself worked up by imagining himself in\ndesperate situations. But this is the real deal.<PARAGRAPH>He runs about, unable to figure out what to do. Finally, he\nuntethers Emil's horse, saddles it, and decides to ride to Hanover, where he\nhopes to catch the night train to Omaha.<PARAGRAPH>As he rides, he can't forget Marie's cries. He's terrified\nmost of having to go back, that she might still be alive, mutilated and\nsuffering.<PARAGRAPH>How could she let this happen? he thinks. He remembers the\ntimes when he got worked up into a frenzy and grabbed his shotgun, and she\nstruggled to take it away from him. Once it fired in the process.<PARAGRAPH>Why did she have to take this chance with Emil? he thinks.\nHe imagines her taking other men down into the orchard. But that would have\nbeen fine, he tells himself, as long as this had never happened.<PARAGRAPH>Frank stops his horse. She's not to blame, he thinks. He's\nthe one who's been trying to break her, he wanted his wife to be as bitter as\nhe is. He refused to share in any of the pleasures she made for herself.<PARAGRAPH>Why had she made him do this? he thinks furiously. Then he\nremembers her cries, and he sobs, \"Maria!\"<PARAGRAPH>Halfway to Hanover, Frank stops to vomit. All he wants is\nto be able to go back home, to his own bed, and be comforted by his wife.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-4-chapter-7"}
