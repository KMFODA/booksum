{"name": "Book 2, Chapter 1", "summary": "The seasons are changing and winter is arriving in the heath, making for much shorter and colder days.<PARAGRAPH>Eustacia is sitting inside and hears voices.<PARAGRAPH>But she's not going crazy \u2013 she's hearing the echoes of the furze-cutters outside through the chimney.<PARAGRAPH>What's a furze-cutter, you ask? Well it's someone who cuts furze, or gorse, which is a type of plant that grew on the heath. Gorse is edible and was used to feed livestock or as fire kindling.<PARAGRAPH>Eustacia eavesdrops and listens as Sam, Humphrey, and her grandfather talk about Clym Yeobright.<PARAGRAPH>Clym is apparently a golden boy, some sort of child prodigy with progressive political ideas and a fancy-pants job in Paris.<PARAGRAPH>Clym's father was a farmer and his mother came from some money. His dad died many years ago.<PARAGRAPH>They then discuss the scandal surrounding Thomasin, who's still unmarried.<PARAGRAPH>Thomasin has been ill and has secluded herself indoors since the scandal broke.<PARAGRAPH>Eustacia stops listening after this. Her imagination is full of Clym Yeobright and she spends the rest of the afternoon daydreaming about him and Paris.<PARAGRAPH>We learn that Eustacia is nineteen.<PARAGRAPH>Finally Eustacia heads outside for a walk.<PARAGRAPH>The sun is setting and she gazes out over the heath towards Clym's house and thinks about how someone from Paris is about to come there for a visit.<PARAGRAPH>Which makes Clym a Visitor, which means he may be a V, or an alien. Now that would be one heck of a plot twist.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219180101/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/return-of-native/summary/book-2-chapter-1"}
