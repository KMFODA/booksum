{"name": "Chapter 3", "summary": "Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters remain at Norland for a number of months while they're trying to figure out what to do. She's convinced that John means well, but grows increasingly unhappy about Fanny.<PARAGRAPH>However, mother and daughter-in-law continue to coexist in relative peace for a single, pressing reason \u2013 Mrs. Dashwood doesn't want to move away just yet. It turns out that Elinor is in love with Fanny's brother, the mild-mannered, perfectly pleasant Edward (who's exactly the opposite of his obnoxious, greedy sister).<PARAGRAPH>While Edward's mother and sister want him to become a successful, important man, these worldly things aren't so important to him \u2013 rather, he just wants to have a happy, quiet life.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Dashwood gets to know Edward a little better, and jumps to the conclusion that he and Elinor will be married in no time. She tells Marianne to get used to the idea.<PARAGRAPH>Personally, Marianne is very fond of Edward \u2013 she just doesn't really understand how her sister can be in love with someone so prosaic. She claims to only be able to love a more, well, dramatic and romantic (like herself) man.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Dashwood laughs this off \u2013 after all, Marianne is only seventeen, and shouldn't despair at this early point in her life.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421140324/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/sense-and-sensibility/summary/chapter-3"}
