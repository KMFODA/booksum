{"name": "Chapter 6", "summary": "Phoebe goes out into the garden.<PARAGRAPH>She sees signs that the garden has been well-cared for.<PARAGRAPH>She can't figure out who's doing the upkeep, but she's sure it's not Hepzibah.<PARAGRAPH>She finds a corner of the garden with a lovely old mossy fountain.<PARAGRAPH>There is also a chicken coop.<PARAGRAPH>Phoebe runs inside to get breadcrumbs for the chickens.<PARAGRAPH>As she feeds them, one of the baby chickens flies up to land on her shoulder.<PARAGRAPH>A voice says, \"That little fowl pays you a high compliment!\" (6.9).<PARAGRAPH>Phoebe turns around and sees the lodger, Mr. Holgrave.<PARAGRAPH>Phoebe introduces herself.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Holgrave tells her that he is the one who hoes and weeds the garden.<PARAGRAPH>He asks if Phoebe wants to see a portrait he has taken.<PARAGRAPH>(Mr. Holgrave is a daguerreotypist, which means that he is an early photographer.)<PARAGRAPH>He points out that this particular portrait is unusual.<PARAGRAPH>Generally, photographs show the faces of their subjects as they always appear.<PARAGRAPH>But this portrait is of a man who shows \"a very different expression\" (6.17) during his ordinary life.<PARAGRAPH>Phoebe identifies the face as that of her \"Puritan ancestor\" (6.18), Colonel Pyncheon.<PARAGRAPH>It's not Colonel Pyncheon, though, since it's a modern face.<PARAGRAPH>Usually this stern, hard man looks \"exceedingly pleasant, indicative of benevolence, openness of heart, [and] sunny good humor\" (6.20). But the photograph makes him look \"sly, subtle [...] and cold as ice\" (6.20).<PARAGRAPH>Phoebe points out the contrast between the man in this photograph and her cousin Hepzibah's miniature portrait.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Holgrave has never seen the portrait but he has heard of it.<PARAGRAPH>He asks if Phoebe can imagine that figure being guilty of a crime.<PARAGRAPH>Phoebe thinks he's talking a lot of nonsense: of course not.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Holgrave changes the subject.<PARAGRAPH>He suggests that Phoebe help out with the garden, since she will need something to do with her energy while she's staying with Hepzibah.<PARAGRAPH>Phoebe agrees, and they start working silently side by side.<PARAGRAPH>Phoebe doesn't really like Mr. Holgrave. He seems serious, almost stern, and she doesn't understand him.<PARAGRAPH>As the sun sets, Mr. Holgrave tells her good night.<PARAGRAPH>He suggests that Phoebe come and see him sometime.<PARAGRAPH>He also warns Phoebe not to drink or wash at Maule's Well (the fountain with the mossy stones). He says the fountain is bewitched.<PARAGRAPH>Then he goes inside.<PARAGRAPH>Phoebe returns to Hepzibah's part of the house.<PARAGRAPH>Hepzibah seems in a strange mood, as though she is listening for something.<PARAGRAPH>The room is very dark.<PARAGRAPH>Phoebe asks if Hepzibah has just said something.<PARAGRAPH>Hepzibah says no.<PARAGRAPH>Phoebe asks if there is someone in the room with them.<PARAGRAPH>Hepzibah suggests that Phoebe go and rest; she's had a busy day.<PARAGRAPH>Hepzibah hugs Phoebe before Phoebe goes to bed.<PARAGRAPH>As Phoebe lies down, she hears what sounds like the murmur of human voices.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200923164503/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/house-seven-gables/summary/chapter-6"}
