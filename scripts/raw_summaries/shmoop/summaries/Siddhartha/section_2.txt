There are a lot of Yellow-Robed Men.<PARAGRAPH>The Buddha appears endlessly peaceful, light, quiet, and contented.<PARAGRAPH>Although Siddhartha feels there is little new information he can learn from the Buddha\u2019s teachings, he intently studies the Buddha\u2019s behavior.<PARAGRAPH>The Buddha teaches all the usual stuff, including the Four Noble Truths and the Eight Fold path. Govinda asks to be accepted into his community of followers.<PARAGRAPH>Govinda is accepted and urges Siddhartha to join him.<PARAGRAPH>While Siddhartha recognizes the Buddha\u2019s holiness, he believes enlightenment must be experienced, not taught.<PARAGRAPH>The two men stop in the woods to speak with the Buddha.<PARAGRAPH>Siddhartha admires the Buddha\u2019s teaching that the world is a complete, unbroken chain of cause and effect. However, he doesn\u2019t understand the doctrine of salvation and escape from the world if in fact the world is eternally one.<PARAGRAPH>The Buddha admits the flaw, but reminds Siddhartha that the goal of his teachings is to relieve suffering, not to describe the universe.<PARAGRAPH>Siddhartha argues the impossibility of reaching enlightenment via others\u2019 teachings.
