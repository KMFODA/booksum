They don't say anything about it to the younger kids, though.<PARAGRAPH>Jessie wonders if the \"intruder\" was a rabbit, but Henry thinks it might have been a person.<PARAGRAPH>Henry says the dog will protect them. They'll just carry on as if nothing happened, though they can't let Benny go into the woods by himself.<PARAGRAPH>Henry is very excited to get to work, so he runs the whole way to the doctor's house.<PARAGRAPH>It's garden day, and the doctor's mother, Mrs. Moore, is going to tell Henry what's up in the garden.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Moore thins vegetables with Henry for a while before leaving him to work on his own.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, she comes back and sends Henry home for lunch. She doesn't want any of the vegetables he pulled, so he's taking those with him.<PARAGRAPH>Henry goes back to the boxcar, where Benny has been building a fireplace all day. Jessie and Violet helped, and they've set up the kettle over it and everything.<PARAGRAPH>The fireplace was good timing because Henry brought home all of those vegetables along with some meat he picked up at the store.<PARAGRAPH>The children prepare the food and start the fire. They're going to have stew for dinner, but in the meantime, it's another lunch of milk-soaked bread.<PARAGRAPH>Henry heads back to the doctor's house. Dr. Moore wants him to clean the garage. What a treat.<PARAGRAPH>No, seriously\u2014Henry thinks that's a treat.<PARAGRAPH>Henry begins to organize the garage, setting aside a pile of bent nails for his own use.<PARAGRAPH>When the doctor gets home, he's very excited to find the garage so organized.<PARAGRAPH>The doctor notices he has four hammers and, deciding he doesn't need that many, gives one to Henry.<PARAGRAPH>The doctor asks Henry to return on Monday to pick cherries from his orchard. He says he could use a few extra sets of hands. Hmm, do you think he knows about Henry's brother and sisters?<PARAGRAPH>Back to the boxcar. Henry smells the stew. Oh, and look\u2014Jessie has made a ladle from more garbage.<PARAGRAPH>The children feast on the stew. When they're finished, Henry begins to make Benny's cart. He decides he'll build the swimming pool the next day, which is Sunday.<PARAGRAPH>After Henry builds the cart, the children bed down in the boxcar.
