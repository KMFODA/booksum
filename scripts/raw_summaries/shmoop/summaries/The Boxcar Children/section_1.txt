They decide they need to bed down somewhere. Benny is already asleep again in Henry's arms.<PARAGRAPH>Violet finds a haystack, and Henry declares it a great place to sleep. Sure, Henry. Sounds great.<PARAGRAPH>The children make sleep nests in the haystack and fall asleep right away. They're super tired.<PARAGRAPH>When they wake up, everyone is hungry. Guess what's on the menu? Bread. That's it.<PARAGRAPH>Benny is thirsty, but Henry thinks they need to wait for dark to find water. At nightfall, they make their way to a water pump and drink their fill.<PARAGRAPH>As they set off on the road, Jessie says they should hide in the bushes if they hear anyone\u2014and then they immediately hear someone. Good timing, Jessie.<PARAGRAPH>The children hide in the bushes as planned. A horse and cart approach, and wouldn't you know, it's the baker and his wife. They're looking for the children.<PARAGRAPH>They say they're planning to look in Greenfield and then give up looking, which is useful info for the kids.<PARAGRAPH>After the baker and his wife are out of sight, the children emerge from the bushes and continue down the road.<PARAGRAPH>Around 2 a.m., they come to a crossroads. One road leads to Greenfield, while the other goes to Silver City. Knowing the plans of the baker and his wife, they choose Silver City.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, they come to a water fountain. It has three levels: one for people, one for horses, and one for dogs. Water fountains used to be way cooler, apparently.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone drinks some water, and then Benny starts to complain about feeling tired. Classic Benny.<PARAGRAPH>Henry decides they will sleep in the woods. Jessie thinks this sounds like a great plan since the woods seem deserted. Clearly these kids have never seen a horror movie.<PARAGRAPH>The kids make beds out of pine needles and prepare to go to sleep. As they drift off, Jessie observes that it looks like it might rain.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219155156/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/boxcar-children/summary/chapter-2"}
