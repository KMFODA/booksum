And at least then, he says, he could respect himself.<PARAGRAPH>Also, at least he would have certainty. If someone asked what he was, the answer would be clear: a lazy person!<PARAGRAPH>For example: the Underground Man once knew a guy who was a connoisseur of Lafitte (a French red wine). That was pretty much the guy's only defining feature, but at least he had a defining feature. So he died a happy (and probably drunk) man.<PARAGRAPH>The point is that the Underground Man has no such vocation. If he could pick something to be, he'd pick\u2026mmm\u2026a glutton (someone who eats huge amounts of food). A glutton who can appreciate \"everything sublime and beautiful.\" The more he thinks about it, the more he realizes that should have been what his life was about: appreciating the sublime and beautiful.<PARAGRAPH>He realizes that such a life would probably have meant a lot of crying. Any time someone did anything beautiful or sublime, he would have wept in awe.<PARAGRAPH>He also would have gotten fat and red in the nose.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227100412/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/notes-from-underground/summary/part-1-chapter-6"}
