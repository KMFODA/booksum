{"name": "Book 1, Chapter 30", "summary": "Blandois recognizes Flintwinch and is floored to see him.<PARAGRAPH>Flintwinch has no idea what's going on and starts choking Affery.<PARAGRAPH>After a little while, Blandois interrupts and kind of laughs off the domestic abuse, basically saying that Flintwinch puts the fun in dysfunctional.<PARAGRAPH>In any case, Blandois has a letter of introduction from a company in Paris that's well known to Clennam & Co.  This is basically how international banking was done back in the day. Now Blandois can withdraw money from Clennam & Co. with the understanding that the Paris bank will pay them back.<PARAGRAPH>Blandois asks for an inn to go freshen up in before meeting Mrs. Clennam.<PARAGRAPH>Flintwinch is sort of at a loss, since Blandois seems to be a gentleman and there are no fancy places anywhere in the neighborhood, but Blandois says he's fine anywhere.<PARAGRAPH>He eats alone and does a weird self-talk to psych himself up.<PARAGRAPH>After dinner Blandois comes back and goes upstairs.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Clennam is waiting for him with some tea.  They are clearly thinking he's some kind of reasonably important customer or client.<PARAGRAPH>There's some small talk.  Blandois is charming and terrifying at the same time. Mrs. Clennam is her usual half-catatonic self.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly Blandois notices the watch that Mr. Clennam left Mrs. Clennam.  It turns out the watch is engraved \"D.N.F.\" which stands for \"Do Not Forget,\" according to Mrs. Clennam.<PARAGRAPH>She goes off on a tirade about how she will never forget and how she lives her life just waiting to die and get to heaven. She thinks she's a shoo-in.<PARAGRAPH>Finally Blandois is ready to go, but first he asks for a tour of the house.<PARAGRAPH>This is bizarre, since it's just an old dump, but Flintwinch takes him around.<PARAGRAPH>It turns out, though, that Blandois is mostly just looking at Flintwinch and not the house itself.<PARAGRAPH>After the tour, Blandois invites Flintwinch for a drink, but as drunk as the two get, it's impossible to get any information out of Flintwinch.<PARAGRAPH>Finally Blandois says good night and promises that he'll be back.
