She hears a scary noise from somewhere within the walls of the house.<PARAGRAPH>When Flintwinch finds her, she is terrified, and his explanation of the noise as \"rats, cats, water, drains\" (1.15.70) doesn't make her feel any better.<PARAGRAPH>From then on, Affery spends her days wondering what on earth Flintwinch and Mrs. Clennam are up to, being scared of the crazy noises she keeps hearing, and trying to attract as little attention as possible.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419213154/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/little-dorrit/summary/book-1-chapter-15"}
