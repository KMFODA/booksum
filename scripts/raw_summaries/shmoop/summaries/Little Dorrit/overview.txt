{"name": "Overview", "summary": "A couple of prisoners, Cavalletto and Rigaud, are in a Marseilles \njail.  Cavalletto is a minor smuggler serving out his sentence.  Rigaud \nis a murderer who's about to go on trial.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile a boatful of \npeople are released from quarantine in England.  Arthur Clennam has just\n returned from 20 years in China.  His dad is dead, so he goes to visit \nhis mom, the cold, monstrous, wheelchair-bound Mrs. Clennam.  Mom and \ndad ran some kind of semi-shady business, and Arthur is visiting in part\n to tell his mom he doesn't want to work for Clennam & Co. anymore. \nHe has also come to ask his mom about the strange feeling he has that \nsomehow, somewhere, someone has been screwed over by the Clennams.  Mrs.\n Clennam is all stonewalling and denial.  And since Arthur has abandoned\n the family company, his part of the business is taken over by \nFlintwinch, Mrs. Clennam's manservant.<PARAGRAPH>In quarantine, Arthur \nbefriended the Meagleses.  Mr. Meagles is a retired businessman who now \ntravels with his family.  They have a beautiful but immature and spoiled\n daughter named Pet, and a maid whom they rescued from an orphanage and \nnamed Tattycoram.  When Arthur goes to visit the Meagles family at their\n house, he falls in love with Pet.  He also meets a rival, the cynical, \nsarcastic, and generally negative and unpleasant (though super-hot) \nHenry Gowan.  Obviously, Pet is totally into Gowan and just likes Arthur\n as a friend.<PARAGRAPH>At Mrs. Clennam's house, Arthur meets Little Amy \nDorrit, the youngest daughter of a guy who's in prison for debts.  She \ntakes care of her whole Dorrit family and makes sure to keep up her \nfather's charade of being a gentleman fallen on hard times.  The other \nDorrits are sister Fanny, a dancer who rejects the marriage proposal of \nEdmund Sparkler, stepson of the world's richest capitalist, Mr. Merdle; \nbrother Tip, general ne'er-do-well; and uncle Frederick, an old \nhalf-senile man.  Amy is super self-sacrificing, kind of masochistic, \nand looks like a high school freshman despite actually being 22.  Arthur\n befriends her and tries to figure out if she has some connection to his\n mother or to the person Clennam & Co. screwed over at some point.<PARAGRAPH>Arthur\n tries to deal with Mr. Dorrit's debts \u2013 or at least to figure out how \nmuch Dorrit owes and to whom.  This involves many infuriating and \nuseless trips to the giant, horrible central bureaucracy known as the \nCircumlocution Office.  All his efforts are totally fruitless, but \nArthur does meet Daniel Doyce, an inventor and factory owner in London \nwho is an all-around awesome guy.  They befriend one another, and Arthur\n becomes a partner in the Doyce's factory, doing accounting or some such\n thing.<PARAGRAPH>One day Arthur runs into Cavalletto, who himself has \njust been run into by a carriage (rim shot)! He takes Cavalletto to the \nhospital, then gets him a job at the factory and an apartment nearby.  \nAlso nearby is Flora Finching, Arthur's ex-girlfriend from about 20 \nyears ago, who is now silly and chubby.  Her dad, Mr. Casby, is the \nlandlord at the place where Cavalletto is renting a room, and Mr. Casby \nhas an assistant named Pancks. (Yep, all of these details do become \nimportant.)<PARAGRAPH>Little Dorrit and Arthur grow to be best buds, or faux father and daughter, or something platonic like that. Though sadly, Amy likes\n likes Arthur, he just wants to be friends. At the same time, Pet and \nGowan get more and more serious, until finally they get married. Arthur \nis totally crushed as Pet tells him she'll always think of him as a nice\n guy. Yeah, hot popular girls are like that.  Tattycoram, overcome with \njealousy and rage, runs away from the Meagleses and goes to stay with \nMiss Wade, a beautiful, lonely, totally miserable and mean woman they \nall met while traveling.<PARAGRAPH>Now we shift back to Rigaud, the prisoner\n in Marseille. Rigaud's trial ended because of lack of evidence and he \nwas let go.  Now he calls himself Blandois and comes to London with a \nletter of introduction and credit from some bank in Paris. He visits \nMrs. Clennam to do some mysterious business and seems menacing and evil.\n Arthur tries to figure out what kind of business this totally heinous \ndude would have with his mother but doesn't learn anything.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone\n who meets Little Dorrit thinks she's the best thing ever.  Flora \nFinching gives her work for Arthur's sake.  Pancks, meanwhile, starts \ndoing some research into the Dorrit family.  And his research shows \nthat\u2026 Mr. Dorrit is actually heir to a massive fortune! He's rich, not \npoor! Out of jail for him! Yay, everybody wins!<PARAGRAPH>OK, not exactly. But the Dorrits are\n suddenly very rich. Snobby, obnoxious, self-important Dorrit \nimmediately starts pretending that everyone he knew when he was in \nprison doesn't exist and the family goes abroad. Fanny and Amy get a \ngoverness (to teach them to be high-society ladies), Mrs. General, who \ngoes through life ignoring anything and everything unpleasant.  Fanny \nand Tip take to being rich and fancy right away.  Dorrit does too, \nalthough he's too pompous to really own it. But, to the annoyance of \neveryone around her, Amy can't get used to the their new lifestyle,<PARAGRAPH>In\n Italy the Dorrits bump into the Gowans, and Amy sees how miserable Pet \nis with her crappy new husband.  Oh, well, too late. Traveling with the \nGowans is Blandois, who for some reason is now Henry Gowan's BFF.  Pet \nand Amy are scared of him.<PARAGRAPH>Back in London everyone is sad.  The \nMeagleses miss their daughter.  Arthur misses Little Dorrit, but he \nstill doesn't get why.  He dedicates his life to his work and thinks of \nhimself as an old man.  Doyce gets sick of not being able to patent his \ninventions in England and goes abroad to Russia, where they actually \nvalue smart people with good ideas.  The business plugs along.<PARAGRAPH>In \nItaly Fanny again runs into the Merdles and Edmund Sparkler.  They all \npretend this Fanny is a totally new person, not at all the dancing girl \nSparkler liked before, and that's fine on all sides.  Sparkler is a \nboring idiot, but Fanny eventually decides to marry him anyway in order \nto make her mother-in-law's life miserable.<PARAGRAPH>Pet and Gowan \ncontinue along in unhappiness. Pet has a baby.  Everywhere they go Gowan\n somehow makes everyone think that he married a woman beneath him, and \nisn't he a wonderful romantic for doing so.  There's a crazy moment when\n Gowan's dog almost attacks Blandois and Gowan beats the dog \nmercilessly.  A few days later, the dog mysteriously dies.<PARAGRAPH>Dorrit\n invests all his money with Merdle, Fanny's new (step)father-in-law.  \nThen he goes back to Italy, all prepared to ask Mrs. General to marry \nhim. But he has a mental collapse of some kind, freaks out, and has to \nbe removed from a fancy dinner party when he starts acting as though \nhe's back in prison. A few days later he dies.  A few hours after that, \nhis brother Frederick dies too.<PARAGRAPH>Blandois keeps menacing Mrs. \nClennam, until one day he just disappears.  This looks bad for Mrs. \nClennam, because it kind of seems like maybe she had him killed. Arthur \nis worried and starts a bunch of investigations to look for Blandois.  \nMr. Meagles looks for him around Europe, Arthur goes to ask Miss Wade \nabout him, and Cavalletto goes to look for him among the various \nimmigrant communities in London.  At Miss Wade's, Arthur finds out that \nthe reason Blandois was hanging out with Gowan was that Miss Wade was \npaying him to spy on him and Pet.  Turns out Miss Wade was seduced by \nGowan, who promptly left her.  Oh, and also Miss Wade is some kind of \nsadomasochistic crazy lady, or something. Tattycoram is still with her.<PARAGRAPH>Back\n in London, things couldn't be going better for Merdle, except for the \nfact that he's scared of his butler.  He is making money hand over fist,\n he's about to get an aristocratic title, and the Circumlocution Office \nhas given stepson Edmund Sparkler a cushy no-work government job in \nexchange for the Parliament seats that Merdle controls.  Everyone wants \nto invest with him \u2013 even Pancks and Arthur.  Arthur puts all the \nfactory's money into Merdle industries.  OK, hands up everyone who \nthinks that's a good idea? Didn't you ever hear the word \"diversify,\" \nArthur?<PARAGRAPH>And then, just like that, it's all gone.  One evening \nMerdle goes out for a walk, visits his stepson and stepdaughter-in-law \n(Fanny), borrows a penknife, goes to the public bath, and slits his \nwrists.  Why? Well, it turns out he was no great mover and shaker after \nall, just a really great shakedown artist.  The whole thing was a giant \nPonzi scheme, and now everyone's investments are totally gone.<PARAGRAPH>Arthur\n has lost the whole of Doyce & Clennam's money.  He feels horrible, \ndeclares himself openly to be at fault, and is promptly arrested and \nthrown into debtor's prison. The same debtors prison, in fact, that the \nDorrits used to live in. In jail Arthur finally figures out that \u2013 duh \u2013\n Amy is in love with him and that \u2013 double duh \u2013 he's in love with her \ntoo. She comes back to London and takes care of him.  But now he feels \nlike a loser who shouldn't drag her down with him, so he kind of pushes \nback on the whole romance thing.<PARAGRAPH>One day Cavalletto comes back \nwith Blandois in tow.  But since Arthur is in jail, he can't do much \nabout the situation besides inform the authorities that that his mother \nis not a murderer. Done and done.<PARAGRAPH>Blandois goes about his \nbusiness: blackmailing Mrs. Clennam. It turns out he knows quite a few \nthings about her.  Remember that thing Arthur was worried about \u2013 that \nthe family had screwed someone over at some point? Oh, boy is that ever \ntrue. Turns out Mrs. Clennam took Arthur from his real mom to punish her\n for having had a relationship with Arthur's dad (Mrs. Clennam's \nhusband).  Also, Mrs. Clennam suppressed a will having to do with all of\n this, which would have made the Dorrits rich instead of having to rot \nin debtor's jail for years and years.  Confused? No doubt.  Check out \nthe \"What's Up with the Ending?\" section for a more detailed explanation\n of this rigmarole.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Clennam freaks out, somehow regains the\n ability to walk, and runs to tell Amy Dorrit the whole story, leaving \nBlandois in her house.  When Amy and Mrs. Clennam return, the house \ncollapses, killing Blandois.  Flintwinch escapes with all the Clennam \n& Co. money.  Mrs. Clennam becomes catatonic and paralyzed for the \nrest of her life.  Doyce comes back, forgives Arthur for his misdeeds, \nand sets him back up at the factory in his old job.  Amy proposes to \nArthur and they get married and live quietly ever after.
