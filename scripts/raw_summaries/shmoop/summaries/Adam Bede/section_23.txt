{"name": "Chapter 24", "summary": "Now you get to see how Hayslope parties. Dinner has ended and \"the great cask of birthday ale\" has just been trotted out (24.1).<PARAGRAPH>Fortunately, all Eliot's characters know how to hold their liquor (at least now that Thias is gone). There will be no drunken brawls, just good, clean, orderly speeches.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Poyser\u2014and a nervous Mr. Poyser, at that\u2014is the first to speak. He's no JFK, but he does a good job of thanking Arthur for his hospitality.<PARAGRAPH>Next Arthur stands up. He thanks Mr. Poyser, praises the local farmers as kind and knowledgeable men, proposes a toast for old Squire Irwine, and\u2014and actually, that's about it. Short but sweet.<PARAGRAPH>Even though \"they hated the old squire,\" the farmers toast him at Arthur's bidding (24.6). Arthur can do better than that. So he announces that Adam will be taking charge of the Donnithorne woods. There's a big, enthusiastic toast.<PARAGRAPH>Now Mr. Irwine gets up to speak. He speaks of Hayslope's values of community and hard work. And of one model resident of Hayslope\u2014Adam Bede. Mr. Irwine declares that he respects Adam \"as much as I respect any man living\" (24.8). Again, a huge toast follows.<PARAGRAPH>Adam gets up to thank everybody. But he's slightly abashed. As he describes himself, he's simply a hardworking guy who \"wishes to do the right thing, and to leave the world a bit better than he found it\" (24.12).<PARAGRAPH>It's been a good ceremony, but not 100% good. Some women heard Adam's speech and thought he \"didn't show himself thankful enough\" (24.13). And Hetty, sitting in the crowd, feels like Arthur is slighting her and neglecting her on his big day. Other than that, it's been a good ceremony.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-24"}
