{"name": "Chapter 42", "summary": "So here we are, once more, in Adam's \"dull upper room\" in Stoniton (42.1). Heavens, will we never leave this dreadful town? Adam himself feels trapped, crushed by the \"irremediable evil and suffering\" that surrounds Hetty's crime (42.1).<PARAGRAPH>Yet there is a silver lining. Adam now looks \"back on all the previous years as if they had been a dim sleepy existence, and he had only now awakened to full consciousness\" (42.2). Otherwise, he's too anguished to get in a square meal, or say a nice word to Bartle Massey (who's still hanging around). Don't worry, Bartle. We appreciate your efforts.<PARAGRAPH>The one thing that Bartle is good for, though, is telling Adam all about the trial. And not just the charges and evidence against Hetty\u2014also things like how Hetty looks (\"white as a sheet\") and how she reacts (\"she hung her head down\") (42.16). Wow, this is the most depressing chapter ever. Let's wind it up.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, when Bartle describes Mr. Irwine's kindness toward Hetty, Adam shows a little gratitude. \"God bless him, and you too, Mr. Massey,\" says Adam (42.17). Finally.<PARAGRAPH>But Bartle isn't one to sugarcoat. There is strong evidence against Hetty; the verdict could easily go against her. Adam, knowing this, decides it would be \"cowardly of me to keep away\" from the courtroom any longer (42.24). So we're leaving this dreary apartment\u2026 and heading to a dreary courtroom. Thanks a lot, Eliot.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210630082925/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/adam-bede/summary/chapter-42"}
