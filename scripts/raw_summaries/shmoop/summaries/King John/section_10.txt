{"name": "Act 4, Scene 3", "summary": "This scene opens high on the walls of the castle where Arthur is imprisoned. In fact, Arthur is at the top of the wall. Huh? What's he doing there?<PARAGRAPH>In a soliloquy, Arthur explains that he's going to make a run for it. He figures that he's dead meat if he stays where he is; even though he might die by falling from the wall, he thinks it's worth risking it.<PARAGRAPH>Arthur jumps\u2014and gets knocked silly. He regains consciousness just long enough to say a brief prayer for his soul. Then he dies.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, in walk the noblemen who were looking for Arthur: Pembroke, Salisbury, and Lord Bigot. They don't notice Arthur.<PARAGRAPH>We find out these English noblemen are secretly in cahoots with Louis the Dauphin (the Prince of France), against King John.<PARAGRAPH>Then the Bastard shows up. He tries to get a hearing from the noblemen, but they want nothing to do with him. They think King John is a murderer and don't want to give their loyalty to him again.<PARAGRAPH>Then Salisbury sees Arthur's dead body. The noblemen make a big show of their grief and anger.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, the Bastard manages to get a word in edgewise. He says that it's definitely a bad thing that all this has happened, but he points out that Arthur could have died by accident.<PARAGRAPH>Salisbury isn't buying it\u2014he's pretty sure Arthur was murdered by King John.<PARAGRAPH>Salisbury and the other nobles kneel in front of Arthur's corpse and swear allegiance to it.<PARAGRAPH>Just now, Hubert, who seems to have a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, walks in. Not only that, but the first words out of his mouth are: \"Hey! So glad I ran into you! You can stop worrying, Arthur's alive!\" Yeah, oops.<PARAGRAPH>As you might imagine, Salisbury is pretty outraged. In fact, he pulls out his sword and threatens to stab Hubert in the guts.<PARAGRAPH>The Bastard tries to calm Salisbury down, but he's pretty worked up. In the meantime, Hubert isn't budging an inch: he swears to defend himself.<PARAGRAPH>When it becomes clear that Hubert and the Bastard aren't backing down, Pembroke, Salisbury, and Lord Bigot head off to join Louis the Dauphin and his army.<PARAGRAPH>Now that they're alone, the Bastard says to Hubert, \"Hey man, tell me the truth: did you do it? Because, if you did, you are definitely\u2014and I mean definitely\u2014going to suffer in hell for all eternity.\"<PARAGRAPH>Hubert says, \"It wasn't me, I swear: I had nothing to do with it.\"<PARAGRAPH>The Bastard accepts Hubert's words. He tells Hubert to carry away the child's body. In the meantime, he plans to go see King John.<PARAGRAPH>Then the Bastard plans to help the king get ready to rumble with the rebellious English lords and the French invaders.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508171050/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/king-john/summary/act-4-scene-3"}
