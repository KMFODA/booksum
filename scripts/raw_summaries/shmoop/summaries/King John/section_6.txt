{"name": "Act 3, Scene 3", "summary": "King John and his posse come back on stage.<PARAGRAPH>Now Eleanor is with them. Arthur is still being held prisoner by King John's men.<PARAGRAPH>King John tells Arthur not to worry: he'll take good care of him.<PARAGRAPH>Next, King John tells the Bastard to go to England and plunder the riches of all the monasteries.<PARAGRAPH>The Bastard leaves to do his job.<PARAGRAPH>At this point, Eleanor calls Arthur over to her side to have a chat with him. This leaves King John free to have a private chat with Hubert.<PARAGRAPH>King John starts off by telling Hubert that he owes him one. Hubert says, \"Hey, no problem.\"<PARAGRAPH>Then King John starts acting weird. He says he wants to say something to Hubert, but he can't, because the time isn't right. If it were a dark, gloomy night, and they were standing in a graveyard, then the atmosphere would be right.<PARAGRAPH>(Gee, King John, just spit it out already.)<PARAGRAPH>Hubert is all, \"You can trust me, King John. I'm your loyal subject.\"<PARAGRAPH>King John says something like \"You see that little brat over there? He's like a little snake that's always in my way. You know what I'm sayin', Hubert? I sure wish someone would take care of him for me.\"<PARAGRAPH>Hubert gets the hint, but then King John can't resist stating the obvious: he tells Hubert that he wants the kid dead and buried ASAP.<PARAGRAPH>Hubert says, \"No problem.\"<PARAGRAPH>With that out of the way, King John announces that now he can be \"merry,\" and he gets ready to leave.<PARAGRAPH>King John says goodbye to his mom and tells Arthur not to worry: Uncle Hubert's going to take really good care of him. (Dang. That's cold-blooded.)<PARAGRAPH>Then they all leave the stage.<PARAGRAPH>History Snack: Shakespeare's Queen Elizabeth I signed the death warrant of her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots in 1587, just a few short years before Shakespeare wrote King John. Mary was involved in a plot to kill Elizabeth, who was standing between her and the English throne.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508171050/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/king-john/summary/act-3-scene-3"}
