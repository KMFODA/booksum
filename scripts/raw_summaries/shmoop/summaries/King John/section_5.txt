(Remember how we told you back in Act 2, Scene 1, that Austria's the dude who killed Richard the Lionheart? Well, it looks like the Bastard just avenged his dad's murder.)<PARAGRAPH>The Bastard complains that it's kind of hot outside and then puts Austria's head on the ground and tells us it's a shame that King Philip is still alive.<PARAGRAPH>Then, in walk King John, Hubert, and Arthur. John has taken little Arthur prisoner.<PARAGRAPH>King John tells Hubert to look after the little brat because he's got other things to worry about. (Like the possibility that his mom may have been taken prisoner by the French.)<PARAGRAPH>The Bastard goes, \"Don't worry, I rescued her.\"<PARAGRAPH>Everyone leaves the stage and the battle continues.<PARAGRAPH>(Note: In some editions of the play, this scene continues, but in our edition\u2014the 2008 Norton Shakespeare\u2014Act 3, Scene 2 ends here, and Shakespeare picks up the action in the next scene.)", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508171050/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/king-john/summary/act-3-scene-2"}
