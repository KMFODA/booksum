{"name": "Chapter 13", "summary": "Mary wakes up excited to start another day of gardening\u2014only to find that it's the middle of the night, and the rain is so loud that it woke her up.<PARAGRAPH>Mary sulks. How dare the weather turn bad when she finally has something to look forward to?<PARAGRAPH>But obviously, if you're living in a house with over a hundred rooms, there is probably something to look at.<PARAGRAPH>She hears that quiet crying sound again, and she decides to go find it, even though it's late at night.<PARAGRAPH>She turns down a number of passages and finds a big room with a low fire and expensive furniture.<PARAGRAPH>There is a boy lying in bed, looking tired and annoyed. His name is Colin.<PARAGRAPH>There's a lot of confusion between Colin and Mary: Are they both sure that the other isn't a ghost? How is it possible that they can both be real? Two unknown, lonely children in the same house? What's going on here?<PARAGRAPH>It turns out that Colin is Mr. Craven's son.<PARAGRAPH>Colin was born when Mrs. Craven died, and Mr. Craven can't stand to look at him because he reminds Mr. Craven too much of his beloved dead wife.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Craven is also worried that Colin is doomed to be \"a hunchback\" (13.42) since Mr. Craven's shoulders are crooked, and that Colin is too sickly to live to adulthood.<PARAGRAPH>So Colin spends most (or all, in fact) of his time inside his giant mansion being fussed over.<PARAGRAPH>All of the servants have to do exactly what he tells them, or he'll throw the most over-the-top tantrums. (This sounds a lot like pre-garden Mistress Mary Quite Contrary\u2026)<PARAGRAPH>But he doesn't really enjoy any of his hissy fits\u2014in fact, he doesn't enjoy anything.<PARAGRAPH>Colin admits that some great doctor said he would be fine if he got out more in the fresh air and was less spoiled.<PARAGRAPH>But Colin hates going outside, so that's the end of that.<PARAGRAPH>Mary tells Colin about the Secret Garden (which she pretends is just a story\u2014Mary is about as secretive as they come) and Colin seems interested at last. Colin decides that he would be willing to give fresh air a try if it's in the Secret Garden.<PARAGRAPH>Colin shows Mary a portrait hanging behind a curtain.<PARAGRAPH>It's of a beautiful woman who looks a lot like Colin. In fact, it's Colin's mother.<PARAGRAPH>Colin had the portrait covered because he's mad at her for dying and leaving him alone.<PARAGRAPH>Mary promises to come back to talk to Colin, and to tell him if she finds the Secret Garden<PARAGRAPH>Colin asks Mary to stay while he falls asleep, and she sings him a lullaby her Ayah used to sing to her.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125021046/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-secret-garden/summary/chapter-13"}
