{"name": "Act 5, Scene 3", "summary": "At Titus's house, everyone has gathered for the much-anticipated dinner banquet.<PARAGRAPH>Lucius, who knows Saturninus's promise of a peace treaty is probably a setup, tells his men to tie Aaron up and starve him until Tamora can be confronted.<PARAGRAPH>Saturninus shows up.  He and Lucius proceed to insult each other until Marcus steps in and tries to make peace.<PARAGRAPH>Titus enters in a chef's get-up and places the tasty entrees on the banquet table.<PARAGRAPH>Over dinner, Titus chit-chats with his guests, asking them what they think about the story of Virginius.  (FYI \u2013 Virginius, a Roman centurion, killed his daughter in order to prevent her rape. But in the play, the characters seem to think that Virginius killed his daughter after she was raped.)<PARAGRAPH>Saturninus says Virginius was right to kill his daughter because the girl wouldn't \"survive her shame\" (whatever that means). Plus, he says, if she lived, she would be a burden on her father, who would feel bad every time he looked at her.  (We wouldn't want that, now would we?)<PARAGRAPH>Titus says he couldn't agree more, then shocks everyone by killing Lavinia.<PARAGRAPH>Tamora is all, \"what'd you do that for?\" Titus says it's Demetrius's and Chiron's fault because they raped her and then cut out her tongue.<PARAGRAPH>Saturninus demands that Chiron and Demetrius be brought forward \u2013 they have some serious explaining to do.<PARAGRAPH>Titus says \"Why, there they are, both baked in this pie, / Whereof their mother daintily hath fed, / Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.\"<PARAGRAPH>(Check out how Julie Taymor adapts this scene in her film Titus.  A word of caution \u2013 the clip contains graphic violence.)<PARAGRAPH>Titus leaps up and stabs Tamora.<PARAGRAPH>Saturninus leaps up and stabs Titus.<PARAGRAPH>Lucius doesn't want to be left out, so he leaps up and stabs Saturninus.<PARAGRAPH>With all the dead bodies littering the stage, Marcus makes a big speech about how Rome is an absolute mess and needs to be restored.  First, though, Lucius should tell everyone about what Tamora and Aaron have been up to.<PARAGRAPH>Lucius obliges, and Marcus holds up Aaron and Tamora's love child as proof that they are bad people and that the Andronici have been completely justified in their recent actions.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone begins to shout that Lucius is awesome and should be Rome's new emperor.<PARAGRAPH>Lucius promises to \"heal Rome's harms,\" starting with Aaron's punishment, which involves being buried alive and left to starve.  (Oh, of course.  Let the \"healing\" begin!)<PARAGRAPH>Lucius announces that Titus and Lavinia will be placed in the family tomb.  Tamora, on the other hand, doesn't get a burial.  Instead, her body will be left for the animals to devour.<PARAGRAPH>The End.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200920141445/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/titus-andronicus-shakespeare/summary/act-5-scene-3"}
