{"name": "Book 1, Chapter 3", "summary": "We meet Mr. Riley, who is an auctioneer and an appraiser. He\u2019s an educated businessman.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Tulliver complains about lawyers some more. We learn that there\u2019s a man named Wakem involved in some dispute about water rights on the river with Mr. Tulliver.<PARAGRAPH>Once again, Mr. Tulliver begins his spiel about sending Tom to a nice school for a good education.<PARAGRAPH>This time Maggie is in the room reading, and she eavesdrops accordingly since the grown-ups are talking about her favorite person, Tom.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Riley has an inspirational poster view of education and talks about how Tom will be able to reach for the stars with a good one.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Tulliver says he wants Tom to have a different job some day. He doesn\u2019t want Tom to be a miller and a farmer like him because he\u2019s heard about sons taking over their fathers\u2019 businesses and causing problems. Paranoid much, Mr. Tulliver?<PARAGRAPH>Maggie pipes up and says that Tom would never behave that badly.<PARAGRAPH>She comes over and Mr. Tulliver brags about how smart she is to Mr. Riley.<PARAGRAPH>Maggie starts telling Mr. Riley about the book she is reading and gives him a rather graphic description of the witch hunts in Europe and how people used to drown witches, just like in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Riley sees that she\u2019s reading a book by Daniel Defoe that\u2019s not really meant for kids. He asks if she has more kid-friendly books, like Harry Potter, lying around.<PARAGRAPH>Turns out Maggie does \u2013 she brings him a book that has a nice illustrated picture of the Devil and describes it in great detail.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Tulliver is getting worried about all this discussion of the Devil and tells Maggie to go away. Maggie runs off to a corner and plays with her doll.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Tulliver notes that Maggie got all the brains once again, but concedes that Tom is really more slow than stupid to Mr. Riley.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Riley says that getting Tom a good education is a good idea, and he knows just the person to do it. Turns out Mr. Riley knows all about a man named Mr. Stelling.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Stelling is a parson who went to Oxford and tutors boys out of his home.<PARAGRAPH>(Historical context lesson time! OK, so in this period (early nineteenth-century England), there weren\u2019t public schools and going to school wasn\u2019t mandatory, or required. So parents could send kids to boarding schools or private tutors if they wanted. There were things like Sunday schools and free schools for poorer kids, but the overall education system wasn\u2019t organized at all.)<PARAGRAPH>The narrator jumps in here to tell us that Mr. Riley is exaggerating his knowledge of how awesome Mr. Stelling is. Basically, Riley doesn\u2019t know Stelling well at all, but he doesn\u2019t want to sound ill-informed. Riley also wants an \"in\" with Stelling\u2019s father-in-law, and figures that landing Stelling a pupil will make him popular with the Stelling family.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118111227/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/mill-on-the-floss/summary/book-1-chapter-3"}
