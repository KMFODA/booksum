{"name": "Book 6, Chapter 5", "summary": "Tom is at the bank talking to Mr. Deane.<PARAGRAPH>Tom has been going on business trips and is doing really well.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Deane gives another one of his patented \u2018back in my day, sonny, I walked 50 miles in the snow everywhere\u2019 type of speeches. This time he talks about how the world is changing.<PARAGRAPH>We learn that Tom has been working for Mr. Deane for seven years and that he is now twenty-three.<PARAGRAPH>(Math Lesson! OK, so back when Maggie came to fetch Tom from school, after their dad lost his lawsuit, we learned that Maggie was around thirteen and Tom was sixteen. So this would make Maggie about nineteen or twenty currently. Philip is a year older than Tom, which makes him 24 and we know Stephen is 25. Lucy is younger than Maggie by about a year or so, which we learned way back at the beginning of the book. So there\u2019s everyone rough ages.)<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Deane gives a very rambling run-down of the business and how Tom has been excelling. After a while, he finally gets to the point: Mr. Guest (the head honcho, and Stephen\u2019s father) and Mr. Deane want to promote Tom and give him a share in the business. So Tom will basically have stock in the company now.<PARAGRAPH>Tom is happy about this.<PARAGRAPH>But Tom has something to ask Mr. Deane: he wants his help to buy back the mill. He explains it was his father\u2019s dying wish and that there\u2019s an opportunity to get it now since Wakem\u2019s current manager is no good and Wakem might just want to get rid of the place now.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Deane is intrigued and says he\u2019ll think about it, but notes that he\u2019d rather keep Tom in his current position rather than make him a Mill manager right now.<PARAGRAPH>Tom says he could do both since he loves work.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Deane finds this a bit depressing and tells Tom that he\u2019ll get married one day and have other things to worry about.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118111227/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/mill-on-the-floss/summary/book-6-chapter-5"}
