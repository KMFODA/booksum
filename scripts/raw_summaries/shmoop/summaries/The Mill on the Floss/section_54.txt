{"name": "Book 7, Chapter 2", "summary": "The narrator gives a run-down of St. Ogg\u2019s society. It\u2019s a town ruled by gossip and a lot of prejudiced and judgmental minds. The women of St. Ogg\u2019s are particularly vicious gossips.<PARAGRAPH>We get a hypothetical, what-if situation: if Maggie had actually married Stephen, people would have been shocked, but would have quickly gotten over it and would have accepted Maggie as Mrs. Guest in due course. In fact, Stephen would be seen as the one at fault, effectively kidnapping Maggie and giving her no choice but to marry him.<PARAGRAPH>But in reality, Maggie was blamed for the entire scandal. The gossips insisted that Maggie seduced Stephen and led him astray and that she was a scandalous woman with no morals at all. Marriage would have retroactively made the elopement OK. But Maggie\u2019s refusal to marry Stephen is scandalous.<PARAGRAPH>Stephen has gone to the Netherlands and writes a letter to his sisters explaining what happened and taking the blame for everything.<PARAGRAPH>But it doesn\u2019t help and the town still blames Maggie.<PARAGRAPH>The rumor mill goes out of control for two weeks and Maggie never leaves the Jakins' house.<PARAGRAPH>Maggie is hugely depressed and thinks the rest of her life will be utterly miserable.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Tulliver gives Maggie reports on Lucy, but she knows nothing of Stephen or Philip.<PARAGRAPH>Maggie finally goes out to see Dr. Kenn for advice and help finding a job.<PARAGRAPH>On her way to Dr. Kenn\u2019s place, Maggie encounters a lot of her acquaintances, who shun her.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Kenn greets Maggie kindly and she tells him the whole story.<PARAGRAPH>He praises her for doing what she felt was right, even though it is unpopular and hard.<PARAGRAPH>He warns Maggie that she\u2019ll have to deal with a lot from now on and tells her about Stephen\u2019s letter.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Kenn suggests that Maggie might want to leave St. Ogg\u2019s and start over somewhere else.<PARAGRAPH>Maggie echoes her father though, and says that she can\u2019t bear to leave her home and start over again. She is determined to stay.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Kenn says he\u2019ll try to help her find a job then.<PARAGRAPH>After she leaves, Dr. Kenn ponders her difficult situation and wonders how to help her.
