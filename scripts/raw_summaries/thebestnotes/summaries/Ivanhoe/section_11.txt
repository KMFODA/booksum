{"name": "chapters 16 - 17", "summary": "This chapter introduces Friar Tuck, the jolly priest who is one of Robin \n        Hood\u2019s men. Earlier in the novel, King Richard proved his valor at Ashby \n        disguised as the Black Knight. After the victory, he quickly disappeared \n        before his identity was questioned. In this scene, he is traveling in \n        the forest when he meets the Clerk of Copmanhurst, who is actually Friar \n        Tuck. The two trust one another; they eat and drink in great companionship. \n        The king and the fat priest get on so well that after supper they decide \n        to sing together. Each chooses a song that makes fun of the other; the \n        priest pokes fun at Crusaders and Richard mocks the priest.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide11.html"}
