{"name": "chapters 33 - 34", "summary": "Prior Aymer is frightened when he is brought in to the camp, but is \n        mostly disturbed because his beautiful, expensive clothes are ruined. \n        Isaac is relieved to learn Rebecca is alive and listens carefully when \n        the Prior offers, for an appropriate price, to use his friendship with \n        the Knight Templar to free Rebecca. The Black Knight is pleasantly surprised \n        at the decency with which the outlaws behave.<PARAGRAPH>At a banquet hall in the castle of York to which Prince John has invited \n        his nobles, rumors are afoot that Torquilstone Castle has been attacked \n        and captured. Word has it that Front-de-Boeuf and Bois-Guilbert, and perhaps \n        De Bracy too, are dead. John is disturbed but listens to Fitzurse, who \n        reassures him that his unscrupulous reign is invincible.<PARAGRAPH>De Bracy dramatically enters the banquet and announces that Richard \n        is in England, Bois-Guilbert has fled with the Jewish girl, and Front-de-Bouef \n        is dead. John is frightened at the news and begins to drink heavily. In \n        his drunken stupor, he realizes that many of his knights are deserting \n        him. He quickly appoints De Bracy High Marshal to secure his loyalty. \n        De Bracy, however, no longer trusts or believes in John. John, in turn, \n        sets spies on De Bracy.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide15.html"}
