{"name": "chapter 3", "summary": "Cedric is in his home, Rotherwood, impatiently waiting for his servants \n        to come home. He is also displeased that his ward Rowena is late for supper. \n        His thoughts are interrupted by the blast of a horn. Then the gatekeeper \n        announces that Prior Aymer of the Abbey of Jorvaulx, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, \n        and a small party of men are on their way to the royal tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouche \n        and want to lodge at Rotherwood for the night. Cedric does not want to \n        entertain these Normans, but his Saxon pride demands that they be offered \n        hospitality; however, he clings to his dignity by refusing to go out to \n        welcome them. Only when they come to him in his hall does Cedric reluctantly \n        welcome them.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric counsels Rowena against appearing before the guests. He does \n        not trust the Knight Templar and does not want anything to interfere with \n        his plans to marry Rowena off to the right gentleman. She, however, is \n        keen to hear the latest news from the Holy Land from the Palmer, since \n        she is in love with Ivanhoe, whom she thinks is still fighting in the \n        Crusades.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide08.html"}
