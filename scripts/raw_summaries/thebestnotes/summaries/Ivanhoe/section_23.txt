{"name": "chapters 35 - 36", "summary": "Isaac of York is warned by his relation Nathan that Lucas Beaumanoir, \n        Chief of the Order of Templars, is also present at Templestowe, where \n        Rebecca is being held prisoner. Beaumanoir is a rigid knight who is insistent \n        on Templar principles, a cruel enemy to the Moslems, and a strong hater \n        of the Jews.<PARAGRAPH>Isaac brings a letter from Prior Aymer to Bois-Guilbert, asking for \n        the Prior\u2019s ransom; the Jew is brought to Lucas Beaumanoir. Until Isaac \n        shows up, Beaumanoir is completely unaware of Rebecca\u2019s presence in the \n        castle. He is annoyed that Bois-Guilbert is guilty of sequestering Rebecca \n        for immoral purposes, since he is a strict keeper of the Knights Templar \n        rules of celibacy.<PARAGRAPH>Isaac is oblivious to the fact that the Prior\u2019s letter nastily hints \n        that Rebecca is a \u201csecond witch of Endor\u201d; in it, the Prior says Rebecca \n        has cast a spell over the Templar. Malvoisin, the preceptor of Templestowe, \n        seizes on the notion that Rebecca is a witch and defends his friend Bois-Guilbert. \n        In the meantime, Bois-Guilbert finds he is strongly attracted to Rebecca \n        and continues to press her to accept him.<PARAGRAPH>Beaumanoir orders a full-scale trial for Rebecca, thinking this is his \n        only chance to save the reputation of the Knight Templar who has acted \n        so out of keeping with the order\u2019s rules. Bois-Guilbert\u2019s attempts to \n        help Rebecca escape the trial by marrying him are in vain.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide16.html"}
