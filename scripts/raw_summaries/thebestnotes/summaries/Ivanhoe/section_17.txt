{"name": "chapters 25 - 27", "summary": "The occupants of Torquilstone receive a letter signed by Gurth and Wamba, \n        but sent by the mysterious Black Knight and Locksley; the letter demands \n        the release of the prisoners. Front-de-Boeuf responds to the letter by \n        asking that a priest be sent to hear the confessions of the prisoners \n        before they are put to death. Wamba, dressed in Friar\u2019s robes, enters \n        the castle \u201cto hear the confessions of the condemned\u201d. When he reaches \n        the place where Cedric and the others are imprisoned, he and Cedric exchange \n        their clothes and Cedric is able to leave the dungeon undetected.<PARAGRAPH>Thinking Cedric to be the priest, Front-de-Boeuf gives him a message \n        for Philip Malvoisin. Cedric rejects Front de Boeuf\u2019s payment and joins \n        the party outside. Subsequently, Wamba\u2019s disguise and Cedric\u2019s escape \n        are discovered. It now seems that a clash is inevitable between the Normans \n        inside and the besiegers outside, now joined by Cedric.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide14.html"}
