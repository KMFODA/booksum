Rebecca is crying out \n        loudly for help. Their bodyguard has deserted them in sheer fear of the \n        outlaws who are known to inhabit the woods. Rebecca begs Rowena to help \n        the sick man. The entire party is then attacked by De Bracy and his men, \n        impersonating outlaws. They kidnap the group and take them to Front-de-Bouef \n        at Torquilstone Castle, which once belonged to Ivanhoe until John gave \n        it away. Except for Wamba, who escapes, they are all taken prisoners.<PARAGRAPH>Wamba meets Gurth, and they go to find Locksley (Robin Hood). Gurth, \n        Wamba, Locksley, and his men meet up with the disguised King Richard and \n        Friar Tuck.
