{"name": "chapter 4", "summary": "When the richly dressed guests enter Cedric\u0092s hall, he receives them \n        politely but without any warmth. He then scolds Gurth and Wamba for being \n        late. When Rowena enters to join in the meal, Bois-Guilbert stares at \n        her beauty. In response, she draws a veil over her face. Cedric notices \n        the interchange and is annoyed with the Templar. The chapter ends with \n        the announcement of a stranger at Cedric\u0092s gates.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide08.html"}
