{"name": "chapter 44", "summary": "Richard, having intended to champion Rebecca himself, is detained by \n        the Earl of Essex who warns him of John\u2019s evil plans. He arrives at the \n        trial too late to fight, but brings with him a troop of soldiers and arrests \n        Albert Malvoisin for plotting with John against him. He gives Lucas Beaumanoir \n        the choice of exile or death, and Beaumanoir chooses exile. Richard then \n        banishes all the traitors except John, who is sent to his mother with \n        a warning. Athelstane gives up his claim to Rowena and retires from public \n        life. Rowena and Ivanhoe are married. Before departing from England with \n        her father forever, Rebecca visits Rowena to thank her.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide17.html"}
