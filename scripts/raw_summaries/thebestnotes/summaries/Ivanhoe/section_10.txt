{"name": "chapters 13 - 15", "summary": "The revelation that Ivanhoe is the disguised winner of the tournament \n        causes a great commotion and some fear in the minds of the Norman nobles. \n        A castle once belonging to Ivanhoe that John had given to Front-de-Bouef \n        is now the object of much speculation, for many think that Ivanhoe will \n        demand it back. Prince John himself is a bit worried about a confrontation \n        until his advisor Fitzurse informs him that Ivanhoe is severely wounded \n        and probably incapable of protest.<PARAGRAPH>When Prince John receives a message that says, \u201cTake heed to yourself, \n        for the Devil is unchained,\u201d he turns pale. He guesses that the message \n        means his brother Richard is free, and his own corrupt reign is nearing \n        its end. At the same time, many of his supporters begin to falter in their \n        support of him, and Fitzurse busies himself trying to rally them back \n        to John.<PARAGRAPH>The tournament ends with an archery contest, which introduces Robin \n        of Locksley (Robin Hood). Locksley easily defeats Hubert. John is enraged \n        at both Locksley\u2019s skill as an archer and his unswerving loyalty to Richard. \n        Cedric also offends John in his surprising expression of support for Richard \n        when he drinks to missing king\u2019s health.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John has planned to marry Rowena to De Bracy, who is pleased \n        with the idea. Now De Bracy is determined to force the marriage whether \n        Richard has returned or not. He makes plans to ambush Cedric\u2019s party as \n        they travel home from the tournament. He will take Rowena and make her \n        his unwilling bride.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide11.html"}
