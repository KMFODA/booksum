{"name": "chapter 22", "summary": "Isaac of York has been thrown into a dark dungeon in Torquilstone Castle. \n        Front-de-Boeuf demands a ransom of a thousand silver pounds, to which \n        Isaac protests. The Normans threaten him with physical torture, so Isaac \n        requests that his daughter Rebecca be sent with an escort to York to get \n        the money. He is deeply upset when he learns that she has been given to \n        Bois-Guilbert as his own personal captive. Isaac is willing to give up \n        whatever wealth he possesses if only he can get Rebecca back. As his captors \n        begin preparations for torture, the sound of a bugle is heard outside \n        the castle, and Isaac is saved for the moment.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide13.html"}
