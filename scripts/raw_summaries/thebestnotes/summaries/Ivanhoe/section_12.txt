Later he learns that Ivanhoe is being taken care of by Rebecca \n        and is relieved. Discovering that his swineherd Gurth has been helping \n        Ivanhoe, Cedric has him bound with rope as a punishment.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric and Athelstane take their group to Prince John\u2019s palace where \n        they have been invited to a banquet. On the way to Prince John\u2019s, the \n        group encounters the dog, Fangs, howling. Cedric throws his javelin at \n        it, wounding the dog. Saxons are a superstitious lot, and Cedric believed \n        this howling was a sure sign of an impending danger. Gurth is upset to \n        see the dog wounded and manages to escape his bonds.<PARAGRAPH>At Prince John\u2019s, Rowena refuses to attend the banquet, which annoys \n        Cedric.
