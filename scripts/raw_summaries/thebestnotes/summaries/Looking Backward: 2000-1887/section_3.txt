{"name": "chapter iii", "summary": "Julian West hears people talking above him as he comes to consciousness. \n        A woman is urging a man not to tell him something. The man agrees that \n        he will try to avoid it. That woman and another woman leave the room just \n        as he is opening his eyes. He sees a man in his sixties, who says he is \n        a doctor and claims that Julian has just come out of a trance. The doctor \n        tries to get some information from him, in particular, the date on which \n        he fell asleep. After a great deal of confusion, he learns from his new \n        host that it is September 10, 2000 and that he has slept for over 113 \n        years. Hearing this news, he falls back asleep. When he wakes up, he looks \n        at his host closely. He thinks that this must be a practical joke, but \n        looking at his host, he sees that this man does not look like the sort \n        to play such a trick.<PARAGRAPH>The doctor tells him that the fact that he slept for so long is unlikely, \n        but not improbable, given what they know of the trance state. It allows \n        a person\u2019s bodily functions to be suspended so that no body tissue is \n        wasted. The doctor tells him that he had been found in the hermetically \n        sealed room. The doctor had been planning to build a laboratory beside \n        his house so that he could conduct chemical experiments, and a flood had \n        uncovered the vault where Julian West was sleeping. The doctor had summoned \n        his colleagues when he found Mr. West, thinking he was dead, but he refused \n        to let them conduct experiments on him. (They had wanted to learn how \n        he had been so perfectly preserved.) The doctor had resuscitated Mr. West \n        and waited for him to wake up.<PARAGRAPH>Julian West gets up to look at himself in the mirror. He does not look \n        a day older. He begins to get angry, thinking the doctor is part of a \n        terrible joke being played on him. The doctor tells him to come upstairs \n        so that he can see for himself that he is in the twentieth century. They \n        go to the top of the house and look out over the city. Julian West sees \n        a fine city with wide streets, parks, fountains and buildings. He sees \n        the Charles River and Boston harbor, and then he knows that he has been \n        told the truth.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Looking_Backward_Bellamy/Looking_Backward_Study_Guide06.html"}
