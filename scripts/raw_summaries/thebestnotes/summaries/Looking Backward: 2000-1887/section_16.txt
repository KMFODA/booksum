{"name": "chapter xvi", "summary": "The next morning, when Julian West leaves his room, Edith Leete comes \n        out of the dining room to check on him. He realizes she has been getting \n        up very early every morning to make sure he does not leave the house because \n        she fears that he will have another crisis. He is very touched by her \n        concern and calls her an angel. He asks her if she knows who her nineteenth-century \n        ancestors were. She says she does, but then she is too absorbed in arranging \n        the flowers to tell him their names.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Leete comes in, and Julian West takes up the question of what \n        he should do to enter the system of this new society. Doctor Leete tells \n        him that he is quite happy to have him as a guest for a long time since \n        he is so interesting. He adds that when the time comes, Julian West might \n        like to take up a lectureship at one of the universities teaching nineteenth-century \n        history. Julian West is greatly relieved at this news.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Looking_Backward_Bellamy/Looking_Backward_Study_Guide13.html"}
