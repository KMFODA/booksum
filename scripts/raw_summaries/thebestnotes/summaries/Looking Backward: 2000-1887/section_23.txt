{"name": "chapter xxiii", "summary": "That evening, Julian West is enjoying music with Edith Leete. He asks \n        her about the conversation he heard when he was coming to consciousness \n        on his first day in the new world. He had heard her make her father promise \n        not to tell him something. Her father had hesitated and had complied only \n        after she and her mother both persuaded him. When he brings this topic \n        up, Edith Leete blushes intensely. She turns up the music and only later \n        asks him not to ask her or anyone else this question. He agrees, but then \n        he cannot sleep all night wondering about it. He cannot figure out how \n        she would know something about him when she had never seen him before \n        the day of his awakening.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Looking_Backward_Bellamy/Looking_Backward_Study_Guide16.html"}
