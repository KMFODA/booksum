{"name": "chapter xxi", "summary": "Doctor Leete takes Julian West on a tour of the universities. He says \n        that the compulsory education of the nineteenth century has been extended \n        in the twentieth century to the age of twenty-one. All men and women go \n        to the university. When Julian West wonders about the cost of this education, \n        Doctor Leete assures him that \u0093the principle which makes all operations \n        on a large scale proportionally cheaper than on a small scale holds as \n        to education also.\u0094 He adds that the high cost of education in the nineteenth \n        century was largely a result of the extravagance of the wealthy class.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Leete says that the reason for placing so much importance on \n        higher education is the belief that it would be unbearable to be educated \n        and to have to live among uneducated people. In earlier times, the educated \n        and the uneducated appeared so different from each other that they were \n        like two different species. He gives three main reasons for the emphasis \n        on universal higher education: everyone should get the most complete education \n        possible; everyone deserves educated neighbors; all children deserve educated \n        parents.<PARAGRAPH>Julian West is struck by the emphasis placed on physical education. \n        He thinks there must have been a real improvement in the human body over \n        time. Doctor Leete is glad to get this information. He thinks that since \n        the wealthy of the nineteenth century spent their lives in debauchery \n        and leisure, they did not get much physical exercise. And the poor were \n        so caught up in making a living that their physical health suffered. It \n        is no wonder that Julian West is impressed with the physical health of \n        people of the twentieth century. Doctor Leete also notes that insanity \n        and suicide are very rare now.<PARAGRAPH>That night after dinner, the women once again leave the men to discuss \n        the new society. This time, the discussion centers around the wealth of \n        the nation. Julian West is curious as to how much wealth is available \n        in this new society. He says that if he had to go back to his time and \n        explain everything to his fellow citizens, they would say it was all a \n        dream unless he could explain how everything was funded.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Leete first explains that the wastes of capitalism, when eliminated, \n        would equal half the wealth of the nation. On top of that, the new industrial \n        system is more efficient, and thus produces much more wealth. First, Doctor \n        Leete lists the many sources of savings in the new society. There are \n        no national, state, county or municipal debts, and no military or internal \n        revenue service. The judiciary system is very small. There is no criminal \n        class. There are very few physically and mentally disabled people. There \n        are no wasteful rich people. There is no waste in households when cooking \n        and cleaning is done communally.<PARAGRAPH>The distribution system of the government also prevents the huge wastes \n        of the old system, since there are no middlemen and very little handling \n        of the products. Next, Doctor Leete numbers the wastes of capitalism in \n        four major areas. First, there is the waste of capitalists\u0092 undertaking \n        enterprises without any clear way of knowing if they will succeed or fail. \n        Second, there are the wastes of competition among capitalists in the same \n        market. Third, there is the waste caused by periodic gluts and crises. \n        Fourth, there is the waste of idle capital and labor. Doctor Leete offers \n        lengthy explanations of each of these four areas.<PARAGRAPH>He is especially interested in explaining the second of these, the wastes \n        caused by competition. He notes that the producers of the nineteenth century \n        worked for their own profit at the expense of the community. If the common \n        good benefited from their machinations, it was only by chance. As often, \n        the capitalists would \u0093increase their private hoards by practices injurious \n        to the general welfare.\u0094 All capitalists dreamed of gaining complete control \n        over some necessity of life and then making people pay huge amounts for \n        it. He tells Julian West that people of the twentieth century are always \n        astounded that this was called a system of production, when in fact, it \n        seems more like a system for preventing production.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Leete explains that part of the cause of the continual ups and \n        downs of the market was the use of money (a representation of actual products) \n        and credit (a representation of money). The empty promises of these two \n        representative systems caused horrible pain and suffering.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Leete next describes the how the nation can be so wealthy in \n        the twentieth century. Most of it has to do with efficiency. The nation \n        sees clearly where the demand is, and so it never wastes labor in producing \n        products that are not going to be used. It is big enough to hold onto \n        products that are temporarily over-supplied without putting people out \n        of work. This means workers are never idle.<PARAGRAPH>He tells Julian West that he has still not seen the real wealth of the \n        nation because it is spent mostly on public amusements and aesthetics. \n        He sums up the philosophy that motivates his society in the following: \n        \u0093competition, which is the instinct of selfishness, is another word for \n        dissipation of energy, while combination is the seed of efficient production.\u0094<PARAGRAPH>That evening, Julian West is enjoying music with Edith Leete. He asks \n        her about the conversation he heard when he was coming to consciousness \n        on his first day in the new world. He had heard her make her father promise \n        not to tell him something. Her father had hesitated and had complied only \n        after she and her mother both persuaded him. When he brings this topic \n        up, Edith Leete blushes intensely. She turns up the music and only later \n        asks him not to ask her or anyone else this question. He agrees, but then \n        he cannot sleep all night wondering about it. He cannot figure out how \n        she would know something about him when she had never seen him before \n        the day of his awakening.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Looking_Backward_Bellamy/Looking_Backward_Study_Guide16.html"}
