{"name": "chapter 5", "summary": "In this chapter, \nWhite Fang is being trained as a sled-dog. Gray Beaver, Kloo-kooch, and Mit-sah \ngo on a journey up the Mackenzie River. Gray Beaver drives a sled drawn by dogs \nthat he has traded or borrowed. Mit-sah, who is learning to drive and train the \ndogs, drives a smaller sled drawn by puppies. The sled carries<PARAGRAPH>nearly two \nhundred pounds of gear and food. White Fang has a moss-stuffed collar put around \nhis neck; it is connected by two pulling traces to a scarp that passes around \nhis neck and over his back. A long rope, by which he pulls the sled, is fastened \nto this.<PARAGRAPH>There are seven puppies in the team, some nine and ten months \nold; White Fang is eight months old. The sled that he pulls is one that does not \nmove over the snow easily, helping to distribute the weight. Also, the ropes of \nvarying lengths prevent the dogs from actually attacking the dogs in front of \nthem. Lip-lip is at the end of the longest rope, leading the team, a fact that \nenrages the other puppies behind him, making them chase him and increasing the \noverall speed. What further enrages the other dogs is that Mit-sah favors Lip-lip \nover them.<PARAGRAPH>White Fang does well as a sled dog even though he still fights \nwith the other puppies when he can. Usually, however, he is too busy working. \nHis team pulls the sled for months until they reach a village at the Great Slave \nLake. There, White Fang eats some chips of frozen moose meat that a village boy \nhas been chopping. The boy tries to beat White Fang, who in turn bites him. The \nboy\u0092s family is angry, but Gray Beaver defends him. The village boys come after \nMit-sah, but they are also bitten by White Fang. It is obvious that he has learned \nto guard property, protect his master, and attack thieving strangers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang17.html"}
