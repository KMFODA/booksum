{"name": "chapter 4", "summary": "The She-wolf now leaves \nher cub alone more often to go on her hunting expeditions. It has been impressed \nupon him that he should not set foot outside the cave. Since instinct is developing \nin him, he accepts fear as one of the restrictions of life, and he does not go \nnear the mouth of the cave. Once he hears a strange sniffing at the cave, which \ncomes from a wolverine. His mother arrives in time to protect him.<PARAGRAPH>One \nday the cub goes out into the open, rolls down the slope, is dazzled by the light, \nand starts crying like any frightened puppy. When he finally gains a foothold, \nhe goes on to explore the grassy area that surrounds him. He is frightened by \na squirrel and a woodpecker. He comes across a ptarmigan nest, eats the babies \n(all seventy of them), and dares to fight the mother ptarmigan, injuring her. \nA hawk interrupts the battle, which the ptarmigan seemed to be winning, and kills \nthe bird. The cub then falls into a river. He struggles towards land, swimming \nfor the first time, but is carried downstream where he is safely deposited. He \nalso comes across a weasel with whom he starts a fight. He would have been killed \nby the mother weasel had it not been for the timely intervention of his own mother. \nWhen she kills the weasel, they eat it together. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang12.html"}
