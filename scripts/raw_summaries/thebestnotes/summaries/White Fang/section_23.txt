{"name": "chapter 4", "summary": "White Fang does not \nreally have much to do in California. At first, he is not friendly with the other \ndogs and vaguely misses the excitement of fighting. When Scott goes out on horseback, \nWhite Fang eagerly follows, traveling for miles. Once, Scott falls off his horse \nand breaks his leg. Unable to move, he orders White Fang to go home, where the \ndog growls and attracts the attention of his master\u2019s wife. He finally convinces \nthe family to follow him back to Scott, but only after barking, which he is reluctant \nto do. He has not yet adopted all canine habits.<PARAGRAPH>White Fang grows more \nmellow in Sierra Vista. He actually begins to play with Collie and actually misses \nan outing with Scott in order to be with the sheepdog. He also learns to tolerate \nlaughter when it is issued by Scott.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang25.html"}
