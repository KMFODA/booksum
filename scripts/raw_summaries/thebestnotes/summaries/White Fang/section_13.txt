{"name": "chapter 6", "summary": "Spring arrives, and \nGray Beaver finishes the journey. White Fang is one year old, and next to Lip-lip, \nhe is the largest yearling. He continues to have his battles with other dogs. \nWhen he fights with Baseek over a piece of shinbone, White Fang rips Baseek\u0092s \nright ear and wounds him on the shoulder. Baseek, old and weak, gives up. In mid-summer, \nWhite Fang encounters Kiche, who has now forgotten him and has had a new litter. \nShe hovers protectively around her litter, trying to drive White Fang away.<PARAGRAPH>When \nWhite Fang is three years old, there is a great famine in the land. Only the strong \nwill survive, for the Indians eat the weaker dogs. The Indians also eat the soft-tanned \nleather of their moccasins and mittens to fill their stomachs. White Fang escapes \ninto the forest to hunt on his own, at times robbing rabbit snares and at times \ncapturing small game, like squirrels and woodmice. At the end of the famine, White \nFang meets Lip-lip, with whom he fights until Lip-lip is killed. He then returns \nto the village and is received warmly and given plenty of fish. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang18.html"}
