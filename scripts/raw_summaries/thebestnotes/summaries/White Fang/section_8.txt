{"name": "chapter 1", "summary": "This chapter deals \nwith the cub\u0092s first encounter with humans. The cub runs down to the stream to \ndrink, and there he notices five creatures he has never seen before. His first \ninstinct is that of fear, yet he does not run away. One of the men approaches \nthe cub and reaches down to seize him, but the cub bites him, for which he receives \na blow to his head, causing the cub to cry. When he receives another blow, the \nshe-wolf comes running. One of the Indians calls the she-wolf \u0093Kiche,\u0094 and she \nsubmits immediately, much to the cub\u0092s dismay. Kiche is the offspring of a wolf \nfather and a dog mother, who was owned by Gray Beaver\u0092s brother. Kiche ran away \nfrom the Indians during the famine a year ago, and since then, she has been with \nthe wolves.<PARAGRAPH>Salmon Tongue, Three Eagles, and Gray Beaver decide to take \nWhite Fang and Kiche to their camp. Meanwhile, the rest of their clan arrives \nwith their dogs, who do not accept White Fang. Kiche is kept tied, but White Fang \nis allowed to roam. As he explores the place, he comes across Lip-lip, another \npuppy, who becomes an instant and constant enemy. When the two pups fight, White \nFang is injured and retreats to Kiche, who licks his wounds. When he goes back \nto exploring, he approaches Gray Beaver, who is making a fire. White Fang burns \nhis nose and tongue when he goes to smell the flames. He yelps pathetically, which \ncauses laughter in the camp. White Fang is ashamed and goes back to his mother\u0092s \nside. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang14.html"}
