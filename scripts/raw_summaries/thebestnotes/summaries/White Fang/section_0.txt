{"name": "chapter 1", "summary": "The novel starts \nwith a description of the landscape in the Northland Wild, which is a cold and \ndesolate place. Some \u0093wolfish dogs\u0094 are harnessed to a sled without runners. The \nsled is made of birch bark and rests on the snow. On the sled lies a narrow, oblong \nbox, along with other essential items, including blankets, an axe, a coffee pot, \nand a frying pan. The box is actually a coffin, and in it lies Lord Alfred, a \ncompanion of Bill and Henry, whom the reader meets in this chapter. Clothed in \nfur and leather, they are traveling across the snow. It is almost evening when \nthey hear a wolf\u0092s call, which is answered by other wolves; the lonely sounds \nof the wolves make the two men uneasy. Once it is dark, they bring the dogs together \nnear a cluster of spruce trees along the water, where they set up camp. The dogs \nare restless but show no intentions of straying from the fire.<PARAGRAPH>The two \nmen begin talking. Bill tells Henry that he had to get an extra portion of fish \nto feed the dogs, because there were seven dogs instead of six. After counting \nonly six dogs, Henry scoffs at Bill and tells him he is seeing things. Bill confirms \nhis story by saying that he has seen the tracks of a new animal coming into the \ncamp. Just then, they hear the wolves howling, and Bill thinks that the visitor \nmay have been one of the wolves. The conversation turns to the dead companion, \nwho was a wealthy man -- a \u0093lord or something in his own country.\u0094 The talk is \ninterrupted by the dogs, who grow very agitated. One dog\u0092s coat is nearly burned \nwhen he gets too close to the fire in his restlessness. The men look up and see \na pair of gleaming eyes in the darkness.<PARAGRAPH>The men, with only a couple of \ncartridges left for their gun, wish they had more ammunition. Bill, in fact, wishes \nhe had not come on this trip. Like the dogs, he is restless. When he tries to \nsleep, he is awakened by the dogs. When he counts their number, there are seven \ndogs again. Bill makes an unsuccessful attempt to wake Henry to prove he is not \nseeing things. The next morning, Henry is the first to wake. Bill rolls up the \nblankets and prepares the sled. He tells Henry that they now have only five dogs \nleft, for Fatty has disappeared. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang07.html"}
