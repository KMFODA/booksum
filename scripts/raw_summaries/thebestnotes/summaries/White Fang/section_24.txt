When the news \nof Hall\u2019s escape reaches Sierra Vista, the family becomes very anxious. For protection, \nAlice, Judge Scott\u2019s wife, lets White Fang into the house every night when the \nfamily goes to sleep, even though the judge does not allow the dog inside.<PARAGRAPH>Early one morning, White Fang hears strange footsteps inside the house. Suspicious \nof the stranger that he finds, he attacks silently and furiously. When the family \nwakes up, they find Jim Hall lying dead in their home.
