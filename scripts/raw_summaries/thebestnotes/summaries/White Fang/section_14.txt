{"name": "chapter 1", "summary": "White Fang is now \nthe leader of the team, positioned at the longest end of the rope. He is not allowed \nto stop without orders. If he does so, the other dogs are permitted to attack \nhim. The other dogs are jealous of his position and rage against White Fang, even \nwhen they are free; as expected, Mit-sah predictably bestows meat on White Fang \nin front of the others, making matters worse. The other dogs always band together \nbecause they fear that White Fang will attack them if they are alone. The wolf \nhates the other dogs equally.<PARAGRAPH>When White Fang is nearly five years old, \nGray Beaver takes him on another journey along the Mackenzie, across the Rockies, \nand down the Porcupine to the Yukon. White Fang attacks the dogs in these places, \ntoo. His advantage as an attacker lies in the fact that he can judge time and \ndistance correctly. White Fang\u0092s sled crosses the water-shed between the Mackenzie \nRiver and the Yukon in the late winter, and the spring is spent hunting in the \nRockies. He later paddles down the stream to its junction with the Yukon under \nthe Arctic Circle. Here stands the Old Hudson\u0092s Bay Company Fort. It is the summer \nof 1898, and the gold seekers are going up the Yukon to Dawson and Klondike. Gray \nBeaver profits tremendously through his trade of fur, gut-sewn mittens, and moccasins. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.<PARAGRAPH>At Fort Yukon, White Fang encounters his first white man. \nHe is suspicious of their dogs, and fights them regularly. He realizes, however, \nthat when he kills the dogs, the gods get angry at this. He cleverly launches \na fatal attack on a dog and leaves it behind for the dogs to rip him apart. Upon \nseeing this, one man fires six shots and kills six dogs in the \u0091pack.\u0092 White Fang \nwalks freely away.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang19.html"}
