{"name": "chapter one: five years later", "summary": "Tellson's Bank is situated by Temple Bar. It is an old-fashioned, small, ugly, and somewhat decrepit building. \nAppropriately, all the employees that are seen in the bank are old men; and they are very conservative. Tellson's Bank is a \nstrong supporter of the death penalty and has caused the death of many offenders<PARAGRAPH>Jerry Cruncher, the messenger seen previously in Chapter 2, is an odd-job \n        man at the bank. He is usually found working outside the old building \n        during business hours, unless he is out on a bank errand. He is helped \n        by his son, young Jerry, who is simply a smaller version of his father. \n        In this chapter, Jerry Cruncher is at home lying in bed. He is angry with \n        his wife and throws the boot at her saying that her prayers are like curses \n        against him and his son. After grumbling a bit he gets up, polishes his \n        boots, readies himself, and sets out to work with young Jerry. He has \n        been called to the bank by one of its messengers.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide10.html"}
