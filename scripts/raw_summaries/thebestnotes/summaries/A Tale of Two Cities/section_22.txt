As they sit in the \ncourtyard, Lucie assures Dr. Manette that her love for Darnay will never replace or change the love she has for him.<PARAGRAPH>The Doctor is now happy about the marriage and states how fond he is of Darnay. One of his fears has always been that \nLucie would never know the happiness of a spouse and child, which have provided him with great joy in his own life. He \nmentions his long imprisonment and how he had often wondered about the fate of his child, still unborn at the time of his \ncapture. Sometimes he would imagine the child to be a boy, who would seek vengeance on his behalf. At other times he \nimagined the child to be a girl, who looked just like her mother and who would come to visit him in prison, finally setting \nhim free. He confesses that the happiness that Lucie has given him far exceeds the happiness from the children about \nwhich he had dreamed.<PARAGRAPH>When father and daughter go inside for dinner, they are joined by Miss Pross, \n        who is going to be the bridesmaid.
