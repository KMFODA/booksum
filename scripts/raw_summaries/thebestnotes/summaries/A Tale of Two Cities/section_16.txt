{"name": "chapter eleven: a companion picture", "summary": "Sydney Carton spends many long nights clearing up Mr. Stryver's legal matters before Stryver goes on his long vacation. \nFinally, on one such night after the work is complete, Mr. Stryver announces to Carton his intentions to marry. Mr. \nStryver assumes that women find him tactful, ambitious, and successful and would be happy to become his wife. He \nthinks that Lucie would be a suitable choice even though she is poor. Mr. Stryver does not mention even once that he is \nin love with Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>Stryver also assumes that Carton is disagreeable to women and informs him \n        of this. Carton is amused with Stryver's attitude and pokes fun at him. \n        Stryver fails to notice the satire in Carton's remarks and aggressively \n        continues his assault on Carton's faults. He finally says that perhaps \n        Carton can marry a commoner, someone with property who will look after \n        him when he ages.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide15.html"}
