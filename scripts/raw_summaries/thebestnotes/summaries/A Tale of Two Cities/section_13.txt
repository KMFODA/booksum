{"name": "chapter eight: the marquis in the country", "summary": "The Marquis makes his way from Paris through the countryside towards the Evremonde \n        family estate. The crops on the way look dried and withered, just like \n        the peasants. When the carriage stops at a poor village, many peasants \n        are at the fountain washing leaves or anything else that can be eaten. \n        The Marquis gazes with contempt at the faces around the fountain. Soon \n        a dusty road-mender joins the group. The Marquis sends for him and asks \n        what he was staring at when the carriage passed him down the road. The \n        man tells him that someone was hanging underneath the carriage; he says \n        the man was tall, covered with dust, and as white as a ghost. The Marquis \n        is satisfied and drives on. The carriage passes a graveyard where a grief \n        stricken woman begs him for a tombstone for the grave of her dead husband. \n        The Marquis ignores her request and pushes her away. The carriage finally \n        arrives at the estate after dark.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide14.html"}
