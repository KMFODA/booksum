{"name": "chapter twenty-two: the sea rises", "summary": "A week after the storming of the Bastille, Defarge enters the wine shop. He \n        tells the others that Foulon, an aristocrat who faked his own death to \n        protect himself, is still alive. Some villagers have found him hiding \n        in the country and have brought him in for trial. As the drums start beating \n        in the street, Madame Defarge grabs her knife. Outside, a fierce woman \n        called The Vengeance utters terrific shrieks and flails her arms. She \n        rushes from house to house, arousing all the women and whipping them into \n        a fury for the blood of Foulon. As the crowd rushes to the Hall of Justice, \n        the Defarges, the Vengeance, and Jacques Three are right in front. The \n        mob, unable to wait for the trial to end, rushes in to the building and \n        drags Foulon out. They hang him from a lamppost outside the Hall of Justice \n        and stuff his mouth full of grass, for he had suggested that this was \n        an appropriate food for the peasants. The patriots, as the revolutionaries \n        now call themselves, then decapitate him and display Foulon\u0092s head for \n        all to see.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide21.html"}
