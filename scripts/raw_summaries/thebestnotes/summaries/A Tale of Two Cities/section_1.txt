{"name": "chapter two: the mail", "summary": "The Dover mail coach makes its way laboriously up Shooter's Hill on a wet \n        Friday night in November, 1775. Tired horses are dragging the coach while \n        the passengers trudge alongside. Because of the general state of affairs \n        in England, the passengers are suspicious of the driver, of the guard, \n        and of one another; they are also afraid of ambush from the outside. A \n        messenger arrives with a message for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, who is an agent \n        of Tellson\u0092s Bank and one of the passengers. The message is that Mr. Lorry \n        needs to wait in Dover to meet a young lady. Mr. Lorry sends a return \n        message to the bank that states only, \"recalled to life.\" The \n        messenger thinks the message is very strange, but agrees to deliver it. \n        Mr. Lorry goes back into the coach.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide06.html"}
