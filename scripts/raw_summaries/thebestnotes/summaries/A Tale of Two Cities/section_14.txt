{"name": "chapter nine: the gorgon's head", "summary": "The chateau of the Evremondes is a large, heavy mass of building, with a large courtyard before it. Two stone staircases \nmeet in a stone terrace before the principal door. There are also stone balustrades, stone heads, and stone faces \neverywhere. The Marquis, led by a torchbearer, makes his way to his private chambers, which are equipped with all \nmanners of luxuries. It is a sharp contrast to the picture of poverty in the last chapter.<PARAGRAPH>A supper is laid out for two, but Evremonde begins eating alone. He is interrupted midway through the meal by the \narrival of his nephew, Charles Darnay. The Marquis receives him courteously though they do not shake hands. Charles \nDarnay is really an Evremonde, and Darnay is an anglicized version of his mother's maiden name. Fed up with the \nattitude of the aristocracy in France and disgusted with the callous and unscrupulous attitude of his uncle, Darnay has \nrenounced his ties to the family and moved to England. He hates the French social system and wants to undo the \nrepression caused by the aristocrats. He works toward the betterment of all, honoring the last request of his mother. \nDarnay assures the Marquis, however, that the family name will not suffer as a result of his activities, for he has changed \nhis name. The Marquis bids farewell to his nephew in his most courtly manner. Nothing disturbs the polished elegance of \nhis aristocratic breeding.<PARAGRAPH>As he prepares to sleep, Evremonde thinks of the scene at the Paris fountain. \n        He remembers the tall man, Gaspard, howling over the dead child. He also \n        thinks of the road-mender's tale of the tall man hanging under the carriage. \n        Not suspicious by nature, the Marquis makes no connection between these \n        events. The next morning, however, the Marquis of Evremonde is found dead \n        in his bed. Driven into his heart is a common knife with a note from one \n        of the revolutionaries who call themselves Jacques. The note simply says, \n        \"Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques.\"", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide14.html"}
