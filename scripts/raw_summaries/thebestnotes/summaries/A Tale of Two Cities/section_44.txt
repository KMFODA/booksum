{"name": "chapter fifteen: the footsteps die out forever", "summary": "The fifty-two prisoners are carried in six tumbrels that grind through the cobbled streets of Paris. Carton stands at the \nback of the third tumbrel with his head bent down, trying to ignore the roar of the crowd. He talks to the young and \nfrightened seamstress while holding her hand. He notices that in front of the guillotine, seated in chairs, are a large \nnumber of women knitting. One of the most noticeable women is The Vengeance; she looks frantically around in search \nof Madame Defarge.<PARAGRAPH>The first tumbrels arrive, and the guillotine starts crashing. The women count \n        each head as it is held up. The third tumbrel arrives, and Carton steps \n        down, holding the hand of the seamstress. He places her with her back \n        to the guillotine; she looks bravely into his face and thanks him for \n        his kindness. Carton kisses her as she heads for the guillotine. He then \n        follows in a calm and victorious mood. As he goes to his death, Carton \n        has a vision that all the revolutionaries will follow him to the guillotine. \n        He also envisions the Darnay family living happily, making the sacrifice \n        of his wasted life very worthwhile. Carton is also pleased to think that \n        he will always be remembered and honored by the Darnays. His last thought \n        comes to full fruition when Lucie and Darnay name their son in honor Carton.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide29.html"}
