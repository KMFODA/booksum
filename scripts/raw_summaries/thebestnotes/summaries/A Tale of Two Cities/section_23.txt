Inside, the Doctor \nand Charles Darnay are having a private conference. As they wait, Mr. Lorry cannot stop admiring Lucie; he grows \nsentimental and teary-eyed as he remembers how he brought her across from France when she was baby. Regaining his \ncomposure, Mr. Lorry assures Lucie that he will look after the Doctor while she and Darnay are away on their \nhoneymoon. When Dr. Manette and Darnay emerge from the room, the doctor is shaken and looks deathly pale.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone makes their way to the church for the ceremony. After the wedding, they all return to the Manette home. \nDarnay and Lucie bid farewell to everyone and leave immediately for their two-week honeymoon. It has been prearranged that Dr. Manette will join them after two weeks.<PARAGRAPH>When Miss Pross, Mr. Lorry, and Dr. Manette are alone, Mr. Lorry notices that \n        a great change has come over the Doctor. He again appears old, scared, \n        and lost; but Lorry decides to say nothing about it to Dr. Manette. He \n        takes his leave and goes to Tellson's Bank to work for several hours. \n        When he returns to the Manettes, he finds Miss Pross in an extremely agitated \n        state.
