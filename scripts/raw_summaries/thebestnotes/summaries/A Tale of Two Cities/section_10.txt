{"name": "chapter five: the jackal", "summary": "Mr. Stryver\u0092s practice as a barrister has been rapidly increasing, probably due in part to his being loud-voiced and pushy. \nHe is judged to be an intelligent lawyer who can extract the essentials from any information. He is also judged as bold \nand unscrupulous; perhaps that is why he is friendly with Mr. Carton. The two of them often drink together into the late \nhours of the night; Stryver drinks for enjoyment, while Carton drinks from frustration. It is rumored that Mr. Carton often \ngoes home, stealthily and unsteadily, at dawn.<PARAGRAPH>Carton, who is the most idle and unpromising of men, accompanies Mr. Stryver on every case that he tries in court. As in \nDarnay\u0092s trial, Carton sits silently in the courtroom with his hands in his pockets and his eyes on the ceiling. Although \nSydney Carton is not aggressive, he is extremely shrewd and helps Stryver plan his defense. Sometimes, he interjects \nsomething into the trial, as seen when he throws the piece of paper at Stryver during Darnay\u0092s trial. It was Carton\u0092s \ncleverness that saved Darnay for the death penalty.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Carton, who is asleep in the tavern, is awakened by a man at ten o'clock \n        as requested. He gets up, dons his hat, and makes his way to the chambers \n        of Mr. Stryver. They go into a dingy room lined with books and littered \n        with papers. A kettle steams on the fire, and on the table sits a large \n        supply of wine, brandy, rum, sugar, and lemons. It becomes apparent during \n        their meeting that even though Mr. Stryver takes all the credit for Darnay's \n        acquittal, it is actually Mr. Carton who had planned his defense. Mr. \n        Stryver proposes a toast to Miss Manette, whom he judges to be beautiful; \n        Mr. Carton calls her a golden-haired doll. When Carton finally goes off \n        to bed, he is drunk and tearful, knowing how incapable he is of taking \n        care of himself or his interests.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide12.html"}
