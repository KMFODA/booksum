{"name": "chapter two: a sight", "summary": "When he arrives at the bank, the clerk tells Jerry to go down to the courthouse, the Old Bailey, and wait for Mr. Lorry. \nThe clerk gives him a note that he is supposed to pass to Mr. Lorry by way of the doorkeeper of the courthouse. The case \nbeing tried that day is for treason. The punishment is that the guilty be hanged, drawn, and quartered. Jerry Cruncher \nthinks the punishment is barbarous.<PARAGRAPH>Due to the nature of the trial, a large crowd of spectators has gathered outside the Old Bailey. Jerry Cruncher makes his \nway quietly through the crowd to the door of the courthouse and hands the note to the doorkeeper, as instructed. A few \nminutes later the door opens allowing him to squeeze in. The doorkeeper takes the note to Mr. Lorry, who is seated \namidst some gentlemen in wigs. Not far away sit two more wigged gentlemen. One is Mr. Stryver, counsel for the \nprisoner, while the other is Mr. Sydney Carton, who sits with his hands in his pockets staring at the ceiling. Jerry \nCruncher manages to catch the attention of Mr. Lorry who nods and signals to him to wait there.<PARAGRAPH>The prisoner is brought in. Everyone turns to look at him except Sydney Carton, \n        who continues to stare at the ceiling. The prisoner is a young man of \n        about twenty-five, good-looking, and obviously a gentleman. He is dressed \n        plainly in dark colors, and his hair is gathered in a ribbon at the back \n        of his neck. He is self-possessed, bowing to the judges and standing quietly. \n        He looks around the room, and his eyes rest on two witnesses, a young \n        woman of around twenty-five and a gentleman who evidently is her father. \n        The father looks remarkable due to the whiteness of his hair and the intense \n        look on his face, like a man who is absorbed with his own thoughts. The \n        daughter has one hand drawn through his arm and the other pressed upon \n        it.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide10.html"}
