{"name": "chapter 20", "summary": "Soon after Elizabeth leaves the room, Mrs. Bennet enters and congratulates Collins on the most happy prospect of his \nbecoming her son-in-law. Mr. Collins accepts her good wishes and gives her the particulars of what has happened with \nElizabeth. He explains his belief that Elizabeth\u0092s refusal stems from her \"bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of \nher character\". Mrs. Bennet, who knows her outspoken daughter very well, does believe that her denial is meant as shy \nencouragement. She explains to Mr. Collins that Elizabeth is headstrong and foolish, but assures him that her daughter \nwill be brought to reason. When Collins hears Mrs. Bennet\u0092s assessment of Elizabeth\u0092s personality, he doubts whether \nhe has chosen the correct daughter and voices his concern. A flustered Mrs. Bennet, who sees a marriage opportunity \nslipping away, contradicts her prior statements about Elizabeth. She then hurries to tell her husband, asking him to \nadvise Elizabeth to accept Mr. Collins\u0092 proposal. Mr. Bennet tells Elizabeth that her mother will never see her face \nagain if she does not marry Collins, but at the same time, he will not see her face again if she does marry Collins.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Collins\u0092 pride is finally hurt by Elizabeth\u0092s refusal. He has truly wanted \n        to find an amiable companion among the Bennet daughters and convinced \n        himself that a marriage to one of them would be an advantage to all the \n        Bennet family. He says he is sorry that he is misunderstood and apologizes \n        if he has been rude in any way.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide13.html"}
