{"name": "chapter 51", "summary": "Mr. and Mrs. Wickham arrive at Longbourn. Mrs. Bennet welcomes them warmly, \n        but Mr. Bennet is provoked by the couple\u0092s easy manner and shameless impudence. \n        Elizabeth is indignant over their behavior, and even the gentle Jane is \n        mortified by their indifferent attitude. Lydia chatters unabashedly about \n        Wickham and seems to be totally in love with him, in spite of the shabby \n        treatment that he has given her. In contrast, Wickham does not seem to \n        be much in love with Lydia. While talking to Elizabeth, Lydia says that \n        Darcy was present at the wedding. Elizabeth is thoroughly intrigued at \n        his presence there and writes to her aunt to find out why.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide23.html"}
