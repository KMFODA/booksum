{"name": "chapter 16", "summary": "The following evening, the Bennet girls, Mr. Collins, and Wickham assemble at Mrs. Philips\u0092 house. Collins finds an \nearnest listener in Mrs. Philips and rambles on about Lady Catherine and her grandiose mansion.<PARAGRAPH>Wickham seats himself next to Elizabeth, and the two start conversing. Wickham \n        tells her that he has been connected to Darcy\u0092s family from infancy. Darcy\u0092s \n        late father, an excellent man, had bequeathed him a good part of his estate, \n        but Darcy had treated him scandalously. Disregarding his father\u0092s wishes, \n        he gave away Wickham\u0092s share to someone else. This act of backstabbing, \n        Wickham says, compelled him to join the army, although he was brought \n        up to take a role in the Church. When Elizabeth asks Wickham about Darcy\u0092s \n        sister, he replies that she is as proud as Darcy; she is now sixteen years \n        old and is \u0091highly accomplished\u0092. He also reveals that Lady Catherine \n        is Darcy\u0092s aunt, and it is believed that Darcy will marry her daughter \n        and, thereby, unite the two estates. Elizabeth returns home with her mind \n        full of Wickham and what he has told her. She wonders how a sweet-tempered \n        man like Bingley could take for a friend a disagreeable man like Darcy.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide12.html"}
