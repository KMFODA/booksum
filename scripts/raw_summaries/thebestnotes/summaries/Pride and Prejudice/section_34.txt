Lydia reveals that Miss King has gone to Liverpool to break free from Wickham.<PARAGRAPH>Elizabeth and Jane are warmly welcomed by their parents. Mrs. Bennet is pleased to see Jane is still so beautiful, and \nMr. Bennet more than once voices how glad he is to have his darling Lizzy back.

First, she does not want to see Wickham in her present agitated state of mind; and secondly, she feels \nher sisters will not be so capricious with the soldiers gone.<PARAGRAPH>Lydia has been invited to Brighton for the summer, and Mrs. Bennet and the \n        younger girls want Mr. Bennet to take the whole family there. Although \n        Mr. Bennet has no intentions of doing this, his answers are vague and \n        equivocal.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide19.html"}
