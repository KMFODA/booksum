{"name": "chapter 36", "summary": "At first, Elizabeth finds the contents of Darcy\u0092s letter incredulous, but \n        soon the veracity of it dawns on her as she recalls the unscrupulous way \n        in which Wickham has floated tales about Darcy and the purely \u0091mercenary\u0092 \n        attachment he has formed with Miss King. She chides herself for being \n        so wretchedly blind to Wickham\u0092s faults, which she believes she failed \n        to discern because of her vanity. Although she cannot accept that Jane \n        was ever insensitive to Bingley, Elizabeth concedes to the critical statements \n        Darcy has made about her parents. When Elizabeth returns to the parsonage \n        from the park, she learns that Darcy and Fitzwilliam will be leaving Rosings.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide19.html"}
