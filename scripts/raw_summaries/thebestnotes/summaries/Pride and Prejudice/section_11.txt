{"name": "chapter 14", "summary": "Mr. Collins has secured his parish through the patronage of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, a wealthy widow with an only \ndaughter. As a result, his attitude towards her is one of fawning subservience, and during his visit at the Bennets, he \nnever stops praising her. Lady Catherine de Bourgh\u0092s daughter is a young lady of delicate health, which precludes her \nfrom taking her rightful place in society.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Collins repeats some of the compliments he has paid to his patroness and her daughter; Mr. Bennet is thoroughly \namused -- \" his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped.\"<PARAGRAPH>After teatime, Mr. Bennet takes his guest into the drawing room, and a book \n        is offered to him. On discovering that the book is a novel, he cringes \n        in horror and proceeds to read aloud from Fordyce\u0092s sermons. He is interrupted \n        by Lydia, who makes a flippant comment about an army officer. Mr. Collins \n        is offended by the interruption and puts down his book. He spends the \n        remainder of the evening playing backgammon.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide11.html"}
