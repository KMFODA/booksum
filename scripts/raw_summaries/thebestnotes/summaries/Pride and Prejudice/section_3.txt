{"name": "chapter 4", "summary": "Elizabeth and Jane, the eldest two Bennet daughters, discuss the events that took place at the ball. Both of them agree \nthat Bingley is not only rich and handsome, but also very refined. They also agree that Darcy is uncouth and \nunpleasant. Elizabeth has not taken to Mr. Bingley\u0092s sisters and finds them proud and conceited, thinking highly of \nthemselves and very poorly of the people who are not as wealthy as they. The good-hearted Jane, however, refuses to \nsee faults in others and considers them charming.<PARAGRAPH>There exists a firm friendship between Darcy and Bingley although they are \n        temperamentally opposite. Bingley\u0092s easygoing, friendly nature endears \n        him to Darcy, and Bingley places a great premium on Darcy\u0092s judgement \n        and sharp intellect. Darcy is the unstated \u0091superior amongst the two\u0092 \n        but his pride is monstrous. The manner in which the two friends react \n        to the party is quite typical of them. While Bingley is absolutely floored \n        by the bevy of beauties, especially Jane Bennet, Darcy\u0092s response is negative: \n        he finds the guests a queer assortment of people who lack beauty and fashion.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide07.html"}
