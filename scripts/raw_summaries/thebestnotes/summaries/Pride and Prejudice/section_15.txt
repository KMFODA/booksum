{"name": "chapter 18", "summary": "On the night of the ball, Elizabeth is despondent because Wickham is not present. Mr. Denny informs her that \nWickham has been called to town. Elizabeth, however, suspects that he has chosen not to attend in order to avoid \nDarcy. She, therefore, decides to ignore Darcy. When she is compelled to dance with Darcy later in the evening, \nElizabeth deliberately mentions Wickham. Darcy is disconcerted and speaks in a constrained manner. Elizabeth \nverbally attacks him, but Darcy remains quiet.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Bingley speaks disdainfully about Wickham and advises Elizabeth not to believe his false story about Darcy. She \ncriticizes Wickham, stating he is the son of a dependent of Darcy\u0092s house. Elizabeth is put off by Miss Bingley and \nseeks her elder sister. Jane informs her that she has spoken to Mr. Bingley about Wickham. Bingley is ignorant about \nthe facts surrounding the inheritance left by Darcy\u0092s father, but he vouches for Darcy\u0092s stainless reputation.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Collins sticks to Elizabeth throughout the evening and refuses to be introduced \n        to any other lady, totally exasperating Elizabeth. He is ecstatic to learn \n        that Darcy is Lady Catherine\u0092s nephew. Elizabeth watches him speak gushingly \n        to Darcy, who responds to him with an air of distant civility. During \n        supper, Mrs. Bennet speaks profusely to Lady Lucas of her expectation \n        that Mr. Bingley will soon marry Jane. Mr. Darcy overhears them, and Elizabeth \n        tries vainly to check her mother\u0092s unrestrained confidences. After supper, \n        Mary tries to entertain the party by singing. She has a faltering voice, \n        and her manner is pretentious. Elizabeth, who is already embarrassed by \n        her mother\u0092s indiscreet behavior, is further mortified by her sister\u0092s \n        attempts at singing. Thankfully, Mr. Bennet catches Elizabeth\u0092s agonizing \n        glances and bids Mary to let the other ladies sing. Mr. Collins then gives \n        a pompous and contrived speech, which adds to the disasters of the evening.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide12.html"}
