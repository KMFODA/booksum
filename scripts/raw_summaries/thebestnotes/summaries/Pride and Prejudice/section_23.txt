{"name": "chapter 26", "summary": "Mrs. Gardiner cautions Elizabeth against falling in love with Wickham, who lacks wealth. Elizabeth denies that she is \nin love with him, but admits he is the most agreeable man she has ever come across. She promises her aunt that even if \nshe is tempted at a later stage, she will not do anything in a hurry. Soon after the departure of the Gardiners and Jane, \nMr. Collins returns to Hertfordshire. The wedding takes place on a Thursday and Mr. Collins and his bride leave for \nKent immediately after the ceremony. Charlotte has extracted a promise from Elizabeth that she will visit them in \nMarch.<PARAGRAPH>Jane\u0092s letter arrives stating that she has arrived safely in London. Jane has written to Caroline Bingley, but has received \nno reply from her. Jane naively rationalizes that her letter must not have reached Caroline. When Jane visits Miss \nBingley, her welcome is lukewarm; she says that she did not receive Jane\u0092s letter. Caroline Bingley does not return \nJane\u0092s visit for four weeks; when she calls, her stay is short and brusque. Jane begins to understand that Caroline does \nnot really care for her and writes to Elizabeth about it.<PARAGRAPH>Wickham relocates his affections from Elizabeth to a Miss King, who \n        has just inherited ten thousand pounds. Elizabeth writes to her aunt that \n        she is not in love with Wickham and feels only cordiality towards him.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide15.html"}
