He even writes a letter to Gardiner to state his \nplans. He is also disappointed in Lydia\u0092s behavior and has resolved not to admit them at Longbourn. In contrast, Mrs. \nBennet has no remorse. Once she hears about the marriage, she ends her voluntary exile in her room and takes her seat \nat the head of the table. She is in high spirits, allowing no shame to dampen her victory. She is ecstatic about her plans \nfor the married couple but her husband has resolved not to admit them at Longbourn.<PARAGRAPH>Elizabeth regrets that she has confided in Darcy, for it embarrasses her that he now knows of her family\u0092s disgrace. She \nfinally acknowledges her love for Darcy, but she feels the chances of marrying him are now lost forever. She is \nsaddened over the situation, for she thinks that Darcy is just the man to make her a suitable husband; she believes their \nmarriage would be the ideal union, but unfortunately Lydia\u0092s disgraceful union has marred her chances forever.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Gardiner writes that Wickham intends to quit the militia and enter into \n        a regiment stationed in the north; Lydia wishes to see her family before \n        they depart.
