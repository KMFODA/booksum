{"name": "chapter 31", "summary": "Colonel Fitzwilliam is about thirty years old and, though he is not very handsome, \n        his manners make him popular. A week after the arrival of her nephews, \n        Lady Catherine \u0091condescends\u0092 to invite Mr. Collins\u0092 guests to a party \n        at Rosings on Sunday evening. Colonel Fitzwilliam is attracted to Elizabeth \n        and converses with her animatedly. The mutually engrossed couple draws \n        the attention of Darcy and Lady Catherine. The latter has no qualms about \n        rudely interrupting their conversation, calling out questions to them. \n        Fitzwilliam asks Elizabeth to play the piano, and she agrees; Lady Catherine, \n        however, rudely continues to talk while Elizabeth is performing. Disgusted \n        by his aunt\u0092s churlish manner, Darcy stands by the piano to pay attention \n        to Elizabeth. During the evening, Elizabeth cannot see any signs of love \n        between Darcy and Miss de Borough.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide17.html"}
