{"name": "chapter 23", "summary": "Sir William Lucas arrives at the Bennets to announce the engagement of his daughter to Mr. Collins. Mrs. Bennet is \ndumbfounded and extremely disgruntled by the news. A week elapses before she can see Elizabeth without scolding \nher for refusing Mr. Collins\u0092 proposal, and a month passes before she can speak to the Lucas family with civility.<PARAGRAPH>Disappointed in her good friend Charlotte, Elizabeth spends more time with Jane. She grows increasingly anxious \nabout her sister since there is no news of Bingley. Jane is also dejected over not hearing from him, but she retains her \ncomposure.<PARAGRAPH>A week later, Mr. Collins arrives at Longbourn and receives a cold, indifferent welcome from the disappointed Mrs. \nBennet. She complains to her husband that \"it was very strange that he (Mr. Collins) should come to Longbourn \ninstead of Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome\". Even though he is staying with \nthe Bennets, Mr. Collins spends the larger part of his time at Lucas Lodge.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Bennet is in a terrible state, weighed down by the twin tragedy of Mr. \n        Bingley\u0092s sudden disappearance and Mr. Collins\u0092 engagement to Miss Lucas. \n        The sight of Lucas is particularly abhorrent to her, for Mrs. Bennet can \n        only think about her being the future mistress of Longbourn.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide14.html"}
