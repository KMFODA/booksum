{"name": "chapter 5", "summary": "Mrs. Bennet and her daughters visit the Lucas Family the day after the Meryton ball to discuss the events of the \nprevious night. Charlotte Lucas has overheard Bingley remark that Jane is pretty and that he likes her very much. \nEveryone unanimously approves of Bingley, but they are in disagreement about Darcy. Most of the women criticize his \nstandoffish behavior and haughtiness; but Charlotte defends Darcy by saying that his \u2018pride\u2019 is an inevitable corollary \nto his position in society as a \"fine young man with a family fortune\". Elizabeth agrees with her partially and says that \nshe could have easily pardoned Darcy\u2019s pride if he had not affronted hers. Mary philosophically muses about the \ndistinction between \u2018pride\u2019 and \u2018vanity\u2019.<PARAGRAPH>The chapter also gives a brief account of the Lucas family--Sir William Lucas \n        was a tradesman formerly and was knighted when he was a mayor. He is friendly \n        and courteous. His wife is a kind soul, but too dull. They have many children, \n        the eldest of whom is Charlotte, a sensible, intelligent, and practical \n        girl.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide08.html"}
