Elizabeth has another \nopportunity to observe the overbearing ways of Lady Catherine. Whenever she hears about any of the parishioners \nbeing quarrelsome or complaining, she goes forth to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them \ninto harmony.<PARAGRAPH>With the approach of Easter, Mr. Darcy arrives at Rosings with his cousin \n        Colonel Fitzwilliam. When they call at the parsonage, Darcy is surprised \n        to find Elizabeth; out of politeness, he asks about her family, and Elizabeth \n        tells him that Jane is in London. Darcy, looking baffled, says that he \n        has not been fortunate enough to meet her there. The visitors soon return \n        to Rosings.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide16.html"}
