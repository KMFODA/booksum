{"name": "chapter 32", "summary": "Since the rest of the party has gone out, the next morning Elizabeth sits \n        alone, writing a letter to Jane. Darcy suddenly walks in. Both of them \n        are at loss for words, but Elizabeth finally asks about the abrupt departure \n        of the Bingleys from Netherfield. Darcy does not say much, but he tells \n        her that Bingley may dispose of Netherfield. Their conversation is interrupted \n        by the entry of Charlotte and her sister. After Darcy departs, Charlotte \n        tells Elizabeth of her notion that Darcy is in love with her. Elizabeth \n        laughs at the suggestion. Darcy and Fitzwilliam begin to often come to \n        the parsonage. Although Darcy usually says little, Charlotte notices that \n        he often looks at Elizabeth.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide17.html"}
