{"name": "chapter 34", "summary": "When the Company leaves, Elizabeth begins to reread Jane\u0092s letters. Suddenly \n        Darcy comes back in. After making perfunctory inquiries about her health, \n        he declares his love for Elizabeth, who is thunderstruck and mute. Darcy \n        speaks a good deal about his pride and makes Jane feel she is socially \n        inferior to him. He acts like his proposal to her is a divine honor, which \n        Elizabeth cannot turn down. Elizabeth, furious over his superior attitude, \n        spares no words in refusing him. She accuses Darcy of separating Jane \n        and Bingley, of treating Wickham horribly, and of acting in an arrogant \n        manner. Darcy accepts these accusations without apology, but it hurts \n        him when she says that his demeanor is not gentlemanly. When Darcy leaves \n        the house, Elizabeth is so flustered great that she breaks into tears.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide18.html"}
