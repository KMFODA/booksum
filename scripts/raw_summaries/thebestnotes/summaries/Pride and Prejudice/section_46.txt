{"name": "chapter 53", "summary": "Mrs. Bennet is crestfallen after the departure of Lydia, her favorite daughter. \n        The only thing that excites her is Mr. Bingley\u0092s arrival with Darcy at \n        Netherfield. Elizabeth fears that her mother\u0092s incorrigible behavior will \n        surface again to embarrass her further. During the first visit, Mrs. Bennet, \n        as always, talks foolishly, humiliating Elizabeth. She also gushes over \n        Mr. Bingley, while being cold and ceremoniously polite to Darcy. Elizabeth \n        is particularly pained by her mother\u0092s icy treatment of Darcy, who has \n        been Lydia\u0092s savior. Darcy\u0092s behavior, which is solemn and reserved, aggravates \n        Elizabeth\u0092s misery further. The only positive thing in the visit is Bingley\u0092s \n        marked attention towards Jane, whom he finds as pretty as ever, though \n        not so communicative.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide24.html"}
