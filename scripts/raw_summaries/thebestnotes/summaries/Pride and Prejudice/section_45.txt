{"name": "chapter 52", "summary": "When she responds to Elizabeth\u0092s letter, Mrs. Gardiner is surprised that Elizabeth does not know the truth about the \nWickham marriage. She informs Elizabeth that Darcy had found Lydia and bribed Wickham to marry her. Darcy then \nmade Mr. Gardiner promise that he would conceal this information and take the credit for having paid Wickham. \nElizabeth is overwhelmed by Darcy\u0092s kindness and finds it hard to believe that he has done all this. She assumes that \nhis involvement has sprung from his sense of responsibility for Wickham.<PARAGRAPH>Wickham confronts Elizabeth and tries to find out if she knows the truth about \n        his relationship with Darcy. Elizabeth is evasive and cynical in her vague \n        response and succeeds in getting rid of him quickly.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide23.html"}
