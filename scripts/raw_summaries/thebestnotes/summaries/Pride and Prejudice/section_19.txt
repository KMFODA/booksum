{"name": "chapter 22", "summary": "Elizabeth is grateful that Charlotte entertains Mr. Collins, which keeps him in a good humor and away from her. \nElizabeth assumes she is simply being kind to Mr. Collins and the Bennets; in truth, Charlotte, who greatly fears being \na spinster, is interested in Mr. Collins as a husband for herself. She does not care if her husband is foolish and vain, as \nlong as she has a husband; she has no romantic ideas that marriage must be based on love. She tells Elizabeth, \"I am \nnot romantic you know. . . I only ask for a comfortable home.\"<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte\u0092s attention to Mr. Collins pays off for her. In his characteristic \n        garrulous way, he proposes to her and tells her to set the day of the \n        wedding. Sir William Lucas and his wife are delighted with the match, \n        but Elizabeth is horrified when she learns that her friend has consented \n        to marry the detestable man.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide14.html"}
