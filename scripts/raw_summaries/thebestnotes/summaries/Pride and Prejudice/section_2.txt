{"name": "chapter 3", "summary": "Mrs. Bennet and her daughters try hard to gain a satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley from Mr. Bennet, but they fail. \nFortunately, Lady Lucas supplies them with a description, which is a very promising one.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Bingley returns Mr. Bennet\u0092s visit and is entertained in the library. He is a bit disappointed because he does not see \nany of the young ladies, but the girls manage to catch a glimpse of him from the vantage point of an upper window. \nWhen Mr. Bennet visits Bingley\u0092s house again to invite him to dinner, Bingley must refuse the invitation, for he will \nbe in London to make plans for the ball to be held in Meryton.<PARAGRAPH>The Bennet girls finally meet Bingley at the Meryton ball. Bingley is accompanied by his two sisters, Caroline Bingley \nand Mrs. Hurst, and by his best friend Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingley is a handsome man with a pleasant disposition. His \nsisters are lovely women with \u0091an air of decided fashion\u0092. Mr. Darcy, however, is the most attractive of all. He has a \nstately posture and exquisite features; above all, he is said to have an income of ten thousand pounds a year. \nUnfortunately, he has a cold, reserved manner. When Bingley suggests that he dance with Elizabeth, he replies that \n\"she is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me.\" Elizabeth overhears the remark and feels somewhat slighted; \nbut since she has a lively, playful disposition that takes delight in anything ridiculous, she does not allow the slur to \nupset her.<PARAGRAPH>This ball changes the future of the Bennet family. Bingley, who dances twice \n        with Jane, falls in love with her; Darcy, who at first dismisses Elizabeth, \n        is later attracted towards her.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide07.html"}
