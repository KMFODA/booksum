{"name": "chapter 57", "summary": "A letter arrives from Mr. Collins congratulating Mr. Bennet on Jane\u0092s betrothal \n        and also hinting at the rumors which are floating in and out of Hertfordshire \n        that Darcy and Elizabeth are soon to be engaged. Mr. Collins also conveys \n        that Lady Catherine views the Darcy-Elizabeth match with an unfriendly \n        eye. Mr. Bennet reads the letter to Elizabeth and voices his thorough \n        amusement, for he believes that Darcy has no interest in his daughter. \n        Elizabeth pretends to be equally surprised at the rumors.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide24.html"}
