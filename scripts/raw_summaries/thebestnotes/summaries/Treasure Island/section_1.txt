{"name": "chapter 2", "summary": "Spring comes \nand with it a mysterious event that introduces Jim to a new facet of the Captain\u0092s \npersonality. Jim\u0092s father\u0092s health worsens with time, so Jim and his mother take \ncharge of the Inn. On a frosty January morning, the Captain steps out of the Inn \nwith his usual accessories quietly, as though the thought of Dr. Livesey still \nweighs in his mind. As Jim is setting the breakfast table, in comes a man wearing \na cutlass, whom he had never seen before.<PARAGRAPH>While he orders rum, he tries \nto get friendly with Jim and inquires if the breakfast in the table is spread \nout for his mate \u0091Bill\u0092. On hearing that it is for the Captain, he asks if his \nCaptain has a cut on his right cheek. This matches the scar Jim observed when \nhe first saw the Captain. Assured that the Captain is his mate Bill, he asks other \nquestions and waits for him out side the Inn. Jim finds something weird in the \nstranger\u0092s behavior when he is asked not to go outside. His confusion doubles \nwhen the stranger wants to surprise the Captain by hiding behind the door.<PARAGRAPH>When the Captain returns, Jim finds him uneasy and disturbed, rather than surprised \nto hear his name being called. Recognizing his mate \u0091Black Dog\u0092 he quickly gets \nto the point without any small talk. Jim is told to leave them alone after serving \nthem rum. Jim\u0092s eavesdropping doesn\u0092t give him any clue about the two sea mates, \nfor he can hear only slow indecipherable sounds. When the sound changes to thuds \nand clinging of steels, Jim witnesses a battle raging between Billy and the Black \nDog. Black Dog manages to escape despite having a cut from the battle on his right \nshoulder.<PARAGRAPH>Asking for another drink, the Captain then collapses on the \nfloor. Jim and his mother feel helpless. In an effort to help the Captain, Jim \ntries to pour some rum down his throat. Dr. Livesey, who is on another routine \nvisit to check Jim\u0092s father, takes a look at the Captain. After examining him, \nhe tells them that the Captain has had a stroke. As a precautionary measure, Jim\u0092s \nmother is asked not to tell her husband what happened, so as not to upset him. \nDr. Livesey, to save the Captain, cuts open a vein from his arm and in the process \nexposes some of the tattoos on the Captain\u0092s arm which are comprised of various \nwritings and a well sketched tattoo of a man hanging from the gallows. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.<PARAGRAPH>After forcing a great deal of blood from the Captain\u0092s body, he regains his consciousness. \nThe doctor tells him what has happened and asks him to stop drinking if he wants \nto live. But the Captain is more concerned about Black Dog. He is quite irritated \nwhen the doctor addresses him as Mr. Bones.<PARAGRAPH>Jim and the doctor help him \nto his room and after putting him in bed, the doctor in his authoritative tone \nwarns the Captain continuing to drink will kill him. On his way to check Jim\u0092s \nfather, the doctor tells him that he has drawn enough blood to keep him quiet \nand that he should rest for a week. Finally, he also tells Jim that if the Captain \ncontinues to drink, his death is certain.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island06.html"}
