{"name": "chapter 14", "summary": "Jim is thrilled as he is way \nahead of Silver and his men. The strange land interests him. He is alone and makes \na study of the surroundings curiously. Everything is new so him. The contorted \ntrees, hills with craggy peaks, unknown flowing plants, deadly snakes, strange \nsounds of birds, everything. Amongst this the only familiar sight is that of the \n\"Spy-glass\".<PARAGRAPH>Some time passes by and Jim is able to listen to \nhuman voices too. Jim is afraid when he hears the voice of Long John Silver. He \ntrudges towards them to overhear their conversation. He listens to Silver talking \nto Tom. Their heated conversation is interrupted with a sudden scream at a distance. \nThis is accompanied by the rustle of birds. Some one had been killed. On asking \nwhat the scream was all about, Silver calmly replies: \"That?, Oh, I reckon \nthat'll be Alan\".<PARAGRAPH>Tom is stunned to hear this and accuses Silver \nof killing him. He says that he will no longer be a member of his crew. He turns \nback and walks away. Silver wastes no time. He aims his crutch at Tom\u0092s back and \nhurls it at him. With a thud it strikes him and he falls. Silver quickly pounced \non him and stabbed him twice in the back to kill him. Jim is dumbfounded. He had \nnever seen a man die before. Two men from the Hispaniola were dead. He \nfears that he could be next.<PARAGRAPH>Jim panics and runs for his life. He doesn\u0092t \nknow where to. All he knows is he that he doesn\u0092t want to die at the hands of \nmutineers. But what he doesn\u0092t know is that another surprise awaits him and this \nbrings his run to a halt. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island18.html"}
