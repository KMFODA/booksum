{"name": "chapter 3", "summary": "As he recovers, the Captain continues \nwith his urge to drink. Pleading for a drink from Jim, the Captain tries all the \ntechniques possible to convince him to serve him a drink: From reminding Jim about \nthe regular wage he earned from him, to befriending him and calling him his \u0091matey\u0092. \nJim refused all of his requests, as the doctor had advised against it. Refusing \nto listen to Jim, the Captain goes on a boasting spree giving examples of the \ndeadly places he has been to, the terrifying men he has encountered and how he \nhad lived on rum. He calls it his meat, drink, and wife. He tells Jim that he \nis experiencing withdrawal symptoms and that strange images are haunting him regularly. \nHe also offers Jim a bribe of one gold guinea. Jim gets quite offended by this \noffer.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, after seeing how upset and agitated the Captain has become, \nJim worries about the Captain disrupting the other patrons of the Inn, Jim gets \nhim a drink on the condition that the Captain will repay all the money he owes \nhis father. Regaining his original composure after downing the rum he refuses \nto stay in bed for a week. He manages to get up from the bed with Jim\u0092s help and \ntells him that if he stayed at the Inn for long they\u0092d have the \u0091Black Spot\u0092 on \nhim. But he soon realizes he is too weak to go and settles down in bed.<PARAGRAPH>He also kept on grumbling about many things which Jim doesn't understand. Except \nthe term \u0091Black Spot\u0092 which he hears three times in succession and also that the \n\u0091the bad men\u0092 are after his sea chest. Jim also finds out that the Captain was \nthe first mate of the legendary pirate Old Captain Flint and he is the only one \nwho knows the place where his treasure is buried. During his conversation, Jim \nis asked to be wary of the seafaring man with one leg.<PARAGRAPH>On asking what \nthe \u0091Black Spot\u0092 is, Jim is again confused with the Captain\u0092s reply. He drowns \nhimself in deep slumber after taking his medication.<PARAGRAPH>That evening, Jim\u0092s \nfather dies, adding to the pain and distress Jim was already going through. The \nCaptain takes to heavy drinking, after regaining his strength despite the warnings. \nHe starts singing and shouting in the house while the others are mourning their \nloss. This scarcely alarms Jim for he knows by now what to expect of the Captain.<PARAGRAPH>The gloomy air at the inn has more surprises in store. On a foggy afternoon, \nJim notices a stranger, a blind beggar approaching the Inn. The man asks Jim which \npart of the country he is in. After finding out where he is, he politely requests \nJim to lead him into the Inn. Once inside, his tone changes and he orders Jim \nto take him to the Captain and threatens to break Jim\u0092s arm if he doesn\u0092t. The \nblind man instructs Jim on how he should be introduced and asks him to do it the \nvery same way. On doing so, Jim sees the fear of death written on the Captain\u0092s \nface. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.<PARAGRAPH>In Jim\u0092s presence, \na business deal takes place between the blind man and the Captain, where the blind \nman passes something from his hand to the Captain\u0092s. After releasing Jim\u0092s hand \nfrom his clutch, he leaves quickly without help. The Captain gets up quickly from \nhis bed mumbling \"Ten O\u0092clock, six hours...\" and unable to complete \nthe sentence falls flat of the floor, never to get up again. Although Jim has \nnever liked the Captain, he cries at his death.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island07.html"}
