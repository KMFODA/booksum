{"name": "chapter 24", "summary": "Jim finds himself floating \nat the southwest end of the island when he wakes up. He is a quarter of a mile \naway from the shore and thinks about paddling in. He changes his mind when he \nsees huge waves, carrying large shiny sea lions. In the meantime, Jim decides \nto approach land with the help of the current that moves northward. The sea behaves \nin its natural way, but Jim couldn\u0092t control the coracle as Jim was new to all \nthis. Unable to do anything against the huge waves Jim lies down in the coracle \njust watching them. The waves look like mountains, hills and valleys. Every now \nand then Jim musters up his courage and strokes the coracle when his hopes look \nup and he sees the trees swaying not far away from him, he knows he was approaching \nland. He expects to reach the shore with the next stroke when a current pulls \nJim back to the open sea.<PARAGRAPH>Here Jim witnesses the most unexpected scene. \nHalf a mile away he sees the Hispaniola sailing. For a moment, he thinks \nabout getting on board as he is dying of thirst. The ship is still uncontrolled \nby the men on board. Jim feels an urge to take control of the vessel and return \nit to the Captain. Jim rows his coracle towards the ship. A wind pulls the coracle \ncloser. He decides to desert the coracle and grasps the jib-boom of the ship. \nThe wave that helps Jim to get hold of the jib-boom makes the ship swagger and \nit hits the coracle. Jim is left hanging on the Hispaniola. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island28.html"}
