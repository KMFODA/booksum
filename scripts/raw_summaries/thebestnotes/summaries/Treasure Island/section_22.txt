{"name": "chapter 23", "summary": "Handling the coracle (Gunn's \nsmall boat) was very difficult, though the boat is small and appropriate for a \nperson of his size. He rows the boat with the water currents. He grasps the hawser \nwhen he gets closer to the Hispaniola. Suddenly it occurs to Jim that cutting \nthe hawser means cutting free the huge Hispaniola. With her size and weight \nit would easily topple the coracle. This thought makes him change his plans but \nthe south sea wind comes to his relief. He feels the hawser loosen his hand. The \nwind forces the Hispaniola to move in the opposite direction. So, Jim picks \nup the knife and cuts the hawser loose leaving just two strands of fiber uncut. \nHe waits for another strong wind to finish the task. Jim hears loud voices from \nthe cabin and recognizes Israel Hands\u0092 voice. Jim hears the crew arguing violently \ninside.<PARAGRAPH>When the long awaited breeze comes, Jim cuts loose the last fibers \nof the hawser. The Hispaniola begins to spin and this terrifies Jim. When the \ncoracle moves with the motion of the ship, Jim impulsively, holds a chord hanging \nfrom the ship. He decides to climb up the chord to get a look at what is going \non within the cabin of the ship. One glance tells Jim that men are all drunk. \nHe climbs down to his boat. The coracle changes its course and moves toward the \nsea. The ship too makes its way southward. The men on board, Jim knows, don\u0092t \nrealize that the ship has been freed from it's anchor.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly the ship \nturns by twenty degrees. Violent shouts follow this and the crew and now Jim sees \nthat the men are aware of the disaster. Unable to face the fact that his life \nmight end on high sea, he lies down in the coracle and prays. Soon he goes to \nsleep dreaming of his home and the Admiral Benbow. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island27.html"}
