{"name": "chapter 8", "summary": "Jim was \nput to work night away when he is asked to deliver a note addressed to Long John \nSilver. Jim is overjoyed as he gets an opportunity to go outdoors. He finds his \nway to the Spy-glass and finds a tall, strong, smiling hunk with one good leg \nand the other cut off close to his hip, cheering the people at the inn. Jim is \nrelieved to find that Long John is not the same person whom the Captain had feared \nas he had none of the characteristics of a buccaneer. He appeared to be a very \nrespectable man and did not fit any of the images of a buccaneer that Jim had \nimagined in his dreams. Jim approaches Long John Silver and hands him the note. \nJust then he sees a familiar face rushing out of the Spy-glass. Jim is sure he \nrecognizes the person as Black Dog and he informs Long John Silver about him. \nLong John doesn\u0092t recognize him. He cross checks with Tom Morgan, who was drinking \nwith him. But he states that doesn\u0092t know him either. Even through Long John doesn\u0092t \nrecognize Black Dog by name, he admits that he had see him with a blind man named \nPew. He asks Ben to locate Black Dog and tells Jim that they will keel-haul him.<PARAGRAPH>Long John then diverts Jim\u0092s attention and involves him in a conversation. \nSuddenly he bursts into laughter. Though Jim joins him, he doesn\u0092t get the joke. \nLater he figures out that Long John is laughing at himself and blaming himself \nfor the loss of money-as Black Dog hadn\u0092t paid for his drink-and that he should \ntakes up Jim\u0092s position as a cabin boy in the ship.<PARAGRAPH>Silver gets friendly \nwith Jim and him that they\u0092ll make a good company and they do. Jim finds him very \ninformative as he talks about various ships and the work taking place on them \nas they walk down to the hotel where the Squire is staying. Long John Silver tells \nthe Squire about the incident at Spy-glass and departs. He nods an O.K. in a seaman\u0092s \nstyle when he is asked to be on board with the crew by four. Dr. Livesey and the \nSquire appreciate Long John\u0092s personality and proceed towards the ship to make \nan inspection, along with Jim.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island12.html"}
