Dr. Livesey asks Silver if it was Jim. He proceeds \nto treat his patients without paying much attention to Jim. He is quite absorbed \nin his work. After checking on everyone, Dr. Livesey asks Silver if he can speak \nto Jim in private. Silver accompanies Jim outside and leaves him with the Doctor.<PARAGRAPH>The Doctor had a lot to say. He tells Jim that leaving his crew and running \naway during the time he was needed most was unkind and cowardly. Jim weeps at \nthis and tells the Doctor that he had blamed himself enough for it. When the Doctor \nbegs him to escape, he tells him about the word given to Silver. He tells the \nDoctor that he had recaptured the ship and briefly describes his adventures. Dr. \nLivesey is delighted to hear this and praises Jim for his efforts.<PARAGRAPH>He \nasks Silver not to rush for treasure. Silver agrees to it.
