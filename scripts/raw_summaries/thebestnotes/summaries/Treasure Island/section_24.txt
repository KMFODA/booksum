{"name": "chapter 25", "summary": "Jim climbs up along \nthe side of the ship with great difficulty. He crawls along the bow spirit and \nmakes his way to the deck. He doesn\u0092t see anybody on the deck except a bottle \ntumbling by. The Hispaniola gets a whiff of another wind and it shudders. \nJim gets a glimpse of red cap and Israel Hands lying down in their drunken stupor. \nThe ship rocks recklessly on the sea due to the rough weather. The coracle on \nwhich Jim floated moments ago sinks. The rash movements of the ship, do not disturb \nthe unconscious Red Cap and Hands except that they sink a little with every tumble. \nJim\u0092s curiosity is aroused when his eyes fall on splashes of blood around both \nof them. Jim wonders if they were both dead.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly he sees Israel Hands \nmove. He moans and positions himself back on the bulwark. Jim walks boldly to \nthe main mast and welcomes Hands on board. Hands is too weak to say anything and \nhe asks for brandy. Jim takes this opportunity to rush down to the cellar. He \nfinds some brandy for Hands and picks biscuits, picked fruits, raisins and cheese \nfor himself. He quenches his thirst with fresh water. Hands is struck by thunder \nwhen he takes the first swig of brandy. When he asks Jim where he comes from, \nJim confidently replies that he has come to take possession of the ship and asks \nHands to call him Captain. He then pulls down the pirate flag.<PARAGRAPH>Seeing \nJim in a better state of health than he is, Hands accepts Jim\u0092s proposal. Knowing \nthat Jim would like to sail ashore, he offers to show Jim how to sail in return \nof some food, water and a bandage for his wound. Jim accepts the deal on the condition \nthat they\u0092d steer the ship to the North Inlet before high tide. Jim fulfills Hand\u0092s \nrequest Hands tells him what to do. Soon they sail. Jim feels elated when Hands \naddresses him as Captain. Proceeding towards the destination, Jim finds something \nstrange in Hand\u0092s demeanor. The way Hands observes Jim, makes him feel suspicious. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island29.html"}
