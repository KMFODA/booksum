{"name": "chapter 16", "summary": "As Jim is out on \nthe island with Ben Gunn, the narrative of the story of the incidents on the Hispaniola \nis taken over and recorded by Dr. Livesey.<PARAGRAPH>As they are making plans \nto go to the island, Hunter informs them that Jim had already left to go ashore \nalone in one of the small boats. Shortly afterwards, six of the mutineers including \nSilver had taken other boats to shore. They are concerned about Jim's safety. \nHunter and Dr. Livesay go ashore in another boat. Their appearance, the doctor \nsays, is not obstructed by Silver\u0092s men. The men Silver had left to protect his \nboats on the shore, saw Hunter and the Doctor coming, but did not alert Silver. \nAs they approach land, Dr. Livesey knows he has to be ready for anything. Covering \nhis head with a big handkerchief, he readies his pistols. The land and go approximately \n100 yards and find the Stockade.<PARAGRAPH>The doctor makes a detailed study of \nthe stockade. He sees a spring of clear water rising from the top of the knoll. \nThe stockade is a six-feet tall structure made of logs. It sits on the knoll enclosing \nthe spring. The doctor assumes that the stockade can easily hold around forty \npeople at a time. It has no doors or openings thus giving the men inside a double \nadvantage. Firstly, their safety and secondly, they could attack under cover.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Livesey is impressed with the structure. He is very pleased to see \nfresh water springs as there was very little fresh water on the Hispaniola. \nSuddenly he hears a man\u0092s death cry. The first thought that came to his mind is \nregarding the safety of Jim. They rush back to the ship. Dr. Livesey finds the \nSquire pale and stunned. Having made a study of the location, Dr. Livesey puts \nforward his plan and they ready themselves to return to the Stockade. Old Redruth \nis positioned between the cabin and the fore castle. Hunter steers the boat and \nJoyce and the doctor load it with all the necessary provisions including the doctor\u0092s \nmedicine chest.<PARAGRAPH>The Squire and Captain Smollet stayed on deck and the \nCaptain takes control of the ship. He warns Israel Hands and Silver\u0092s men against \nany deadly maneuvers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.<PARAGRAPH>The boat rows towards the stockade under the watchful eyes \nof Long John\u0092s men. They don\u0092t move. After loading the goods and entrusting Joyce \nto guard them, Hunter and the doctor come back for the second load. They make \na lot of trips. When the last load is stacked, Captain Smollet asks Abraham Gray \nto join him and go to shore. Sound of blows are heard and he appears from the \nforecastle with a cut on his right check. He climbs down to the small boat and \nheads to shore with them.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island20.html"}
