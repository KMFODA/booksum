He tells Jim that they\u0092ll stick together at all odds.<PARAGRAPH>The buccaneers stuff themselves with a roasted ox. Silver also joins the \ngang and Jim sees that he, like any other pirate was gorging on the meal. He keeps \non talking about the treasure and their journey back home. All the while Jim can\u0092t \ndecide if Silver were on his side or the mutineers. Unlike the pirates, Jim can\u0092t \nenjoy his breakfast as all these thoughts were fighting in his mind. He also wonders \nabout his friends.<PARAGRAPH>The treasure hunt begins. Everybody is well armed with \ntheir necessary accessories. Picks, shovels, pistols, food and alcohol. Jim is \ntied around his waist and the loose end of the rope is held by Silver. They follow \nthe map looking for the `tall tree\u0092, which Captain Flint had marked. Silver leads \nthem. The men move on all fours when they reach the plateau.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly \none of the men screams in terror. When they reach the place they see a dead carcass. \nSilver observes something strange in the body\u0092s position. On a closer observation, \nSilver finds that the body pointed straight in the direction of the Island and \nthe compass reading also matched exactly with the one on the chart. Silver recognizes \nthe corpse as Allardyce, one of Flint\u0092s men. Morgan is quick to remember that \nthe man had owed him money and that he had his knife too.<PARAGRAPH>Morgan searches \nfor his knife and finds nothing. Silver reminds them they were six men now just \nlike Flint\u0092s six men. He tells them that all six of them were dead, today. One \nof the seamen breaks out into the sea song of Billy Bones. This untimely singing \ndisgusts Jim. They go on with their hunt except that the men stay close to Silver \nand speak softly. They fear the dead man\u0092s spirits.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island35.html"}
