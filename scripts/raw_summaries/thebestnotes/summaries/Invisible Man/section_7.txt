{"name": "chapter 7", "summary": "The narrator arrives at the bus station and recognizes the veteran surgeon from the Golden Day. Though he does not want \nto sit by the man since the experience from the day before still haunts him, he has no choice, for blacks are relegated to a \nsmall section in the rear. When he sits next to him, the narrator learns that the veteran is being transferred to another \nmental institution. The veteran begins to tease the narrator about traveling north to seek freedom. He also warns the \nyoung black man to wake up and be aware of the lying that goes on; he insists that he does not have to believe in the lies \nto succeed. He explains that the reality is that people do not see the narrator, for he is black; he then tries to explain the \nadvantages of being invisible. The narrator, confused, ignores the old man. Before getting off at the first stop, the veteran \nacts in a nurturing manner towards the narrator, putting his hand on his shoulder and offering some last advice. He tells \nthe narrator to be his person, for the world is full of possibility. He also warns him to stay away from the Mr. Nortons in \nlife.<PARAGRAPH>When the narrator leaves the bus, he heads towards Harlem, feeling worldly and sophisticated with his suitcase and leather \nbriefcase in hand. Entering the subway system, he struggles against the crowd. He is afraid of standing close to the \nwoman on the subway and thinks that riots must regularly happen because of such crowded situations. He decides that \nnext time he will enter the subway with his hands on the lapels of his jacket. Walking into Harlem, he is shocked to see \nthe multitudes of black people living and working as normal employees, such as cashiers and police officers. Perhaps he \ncan believe what the veteran has said about a world of possibility.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator is suddenly jolted by the voice of Ras, a West Indian man standing \n        on a soapbox and yelling angry words about the government. The narrator \n        feels sure the speech will spark a riot; however, he notices two white \n        police officers calmly talking amongst themselves with their backs turned \n        to the scene. The policemen see him staring and question him. He asks \n        for directions to the Men's House. Upon getting there, he relaxes, realizing \n        he will not be able to take in Harlem all at once.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Invisible_Man_Ellison/Invisible_Man_Study_Guide10.html"}
