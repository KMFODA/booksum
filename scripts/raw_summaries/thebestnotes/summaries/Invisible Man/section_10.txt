{"name": "chapter 10", "summary": "The narrator arrives at the Liberty Paint factory and learns he is one of several young black men brought in to the plant to \nreplace striking union workers. Shortly after arriving, he gets an assignment with Mr. Kimbro, a very loud and angry \nman. He learns to mix chemicals into paint to make it white. However, Mr. Kimbro does not explain everything \nproperly, and the narrator ends up making batches of useless gray paint. After he finishes correcting his work by adding a \ndarker paint, he is sent back to the main office where he is assigned another position in the plant, as Lucius Brockway's \nassistant.<PARAGRAPH>Lucius Brockway does not really want an assistant, fearing that personnel \n        is trying to replace him from his job. He accepts this young man, since \n        the narrator does not appear threatening. His first assignment is to read \n        the gauges in the basement. Mr. Brockway talks a little more about himself \n        and the company before the narrator leaves to take his lunch in the break \n        room, where he is stopped by members holding a union meeting. Fearing \n        he is a traitor, they hassle him. Eventually, he has lunch and returns \n        to the basement. Mr. Brockway threatens to kill him when he hears that \n        he encountered a union meeting. They engage in a physical fight, until \n        Mr. Brockway gives in. Then Mr. Brockway leaves the scene laughing when \n        the narrator loses control of a machine. There is an explosion of machine \n        parts, which fall on him, and the narrator loses consciousness.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Invisible_Man_Ellison/Invisible_Man_Study_Guide11.html"}
