{"name": "chapter 16", "summary": "Jack and the members of the Brotherhood introduce the narrator to a life he has been totally unacquainted with. They pick \nhim up and drive him around to give speeches he does not fully understand and espouse values he is not entirely sure of. \nIn this chapter, Jack and the Brotherhood take him to give a speech but tell him to wait until the crowd is at the height of \nimpatience. Other men gather and talk in the crowded room. The narrator looks at a photograph of a champion boxer, \nblinded from fighting in the very arena in which he now stands. He remembers his father telling him the story of the \nfighter. He takes a seat, feeling sad. He begins to get anxious, worried that the crowd will resent him for speaking so late \nand making them wait. He has no choice but to trust the Brotherhood.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator worries that he may forget his new identity. He feels divided between his old self and his new self, and more \nthan a little bewildered by the present. He wonders if delivering the speech and receiving the attention it brings will be \nenough to mold his new self instantly. Once on stage, the narrator is blinded by the spotlight and bumps into the men in \nfront of him. The crowd begins singing a song, and he is afraid the police in the audience will recognize him. Jack \nassures him that the police are present for their protection only, because they are holding a political rally. The crowd \nbegins chanting and speakers go to the podium one by one. Finally, it is his turn to speak. He has trouble adjusting to the \nmicrophone, having never used one before. He still delivers a powerful speech on dispossession. At some point there is a \nnatural pause in his speech and the audience applauds wildly. He is not sure how to proceed. Jack pretends to adjust the \nmicrophone for him and warns him to be careful about proceeding into his personal life too much. He reminds the \nnarrator that he is not an individual, but the voice for the larger group. As his speech ends, the crowd claps fanatically. \nJack jumps to congratulate him, and others come from every direction to kiss him, hug him, slap him on the back, and \nthank him.<PARAGRAPH>Brother Jack cannot stop celebrating, until another brother with a pipe begins to complain loudly about the speech. The \nman, Brother Wrestrum, feels the narrator is reactionary and dangerous. He feels the people should be helped to \nunderstand their goals intellectually, not stirred so wildly emotionally. Jack announces that he has already planned for the \nnew speechmaker to be trained by Brother Hambro. The narrator is told that he will receive his regular salary, but he is to \nstay out of Harlem and study for a while.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator goes home, takes a shower, and goes to bed, but he is unable \n        to sleep. He thinks back over his speech and feels as if someone else \n        delivered it. He begins to wonder what exactly is meant by some of the \n        things that he had said. He is perplexed by the statement that he was \n        becoming more human. He does feel, however, that he is doing more than \n        he or Bledsoe or Norton ever dreamed he would do. For the first time, \n        he feels as if he is more than just a member of a \"race.\" The \n        irony is that he understands very little about what he is doing, who the \n        Brotherhood is, and what their ideas mean. He certainly does not know \n        who he is even though he has been given a purpose and an identity. For \n        the time being, those things blind him to the things he does not know.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Invisible_Man_Ellison/Invisible_Man_Study_Guide15.html"}
