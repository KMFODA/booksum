{"name": "chapter 6", "summary": "The narrator goes to Dr. Bledsoe's office. He is questioned about his intentions, called degrading names, and accused of \ntrying to ruin the college. Dr. Bledsoe tells him that to please white men, he must lie to them. The narrator is confused, \nfor he holds fast to a belief in honesty. Dr. Bledsoe questions the narrator about the black surgeon at Golden Day; he \ncomments that this man should be locked away from society for speaking so directly to a white man. He then tells the \nnarrator that he is being dismissed from the college. The narrator explodes and threatens to tell Mr. Norton the truth, to \nwhich Dr. Bledsoe responds with nervous and shocked laughter. Dr. Bledsoe believes he has power over the white men \nbecause he has told them the lies they want to hear; he does not want the narrator to tell the truth.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Bledsoe tells the narrator that he has obviously not been taught much of anything about the world. He then tells the \nnarrator he does not exist, because he has no place in this power hierarchy. The narrator is so disillusioned he begins to \nstop listening to Dr. Bledsoe as he rambles on. As the narrator gets up to leave, Dr. Bledsoe announces that he will spare \nthe narrator some of his humiliation by sending him to New York for the summer to get a job, even going so far as to offer \nsome letters of recommendation. The narrator is given two days to leave campus. He walks away from the office \nwondering how he strayed from what seemed like the perfect path. He suddenly feels his grandfather's presence haunting \nhim. He decides to accept the guilt of putting the school at risk and acknowledging his punishment as fair. He goes to his \ndorm, counts his money, and decides to leave first thing in the morning.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator arrives at Dr. Bledsoe's office early the next day. Dr. Bledsoe \n        prefaces the conversation by stressing that he will not change his mind. \n        The narrator assures Dr. Bledsoe that he is in strict agreement with his \n        decisions. Dr. Bledsoe tells the narrator he has made the right decision \n        by not fighting him. He then tells the narrator that two things make black \n        men successful: accepting responsibility and not being bitter. The narrator \n        then asks for the letters of recommendation. Dr. Bledsoe instructs him \n        to return later and pick them up, but never unseal them. He returns for \n        the letters, seven in all, and leaves to catch his bus, oblivious to the \n        fact that the letters betray him.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Invisible_Man_Ellison/Invisible_Man_Study_Guide09.html"}
