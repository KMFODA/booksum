{"name": "chapter 17", "summary": "After four months of study, Jack takes him to Harlem. However, instead of delivering speeches, he is taken out for drinks. \nThe lack of activity bothers the narrator, who longs for another chance at glory. He studies more than ever, preparing for \nthe next speech. Jack informs the narrator that he has been voted spokesperson for the Harlem district. He is advised to \nkeep the people stirred up and active. He will be provided with guidance and orders. Jack explains that he has freedom to \noperate within the guidelines of the organization. He tells him that he will have an appointment with the executive \ncommittee of the Harlem section the next day at nine. Jack then takes him to the location of his new office. They are met \nat the door by Brother Tarp.<PARAGRAPH>The next morning, the narrator arrives on time. He is announced as the new spokesperson just as Brother Clifton arrives \nlate. At first, the narrator is threatened by the handsome young man, thinking he is a rival for his position. Clifton \nexplains his tardiness by saying he was seeing a doctor to treat his wounds from an encounter with Ras the Exhorter and \nhis nationalists. In the meeting the narrator suggests that they focus on the eviction issue in the community by getting the \nsupport of local officials. Brother Clifton supports his idea. Then, he suggests taking the speeches to the streets like Ras \ndoes. The committee agrees but reminds Clifton of the non-violence rule of the group. Jack leaves, and Clifton and the \nnarrator go over plans for street speeches. The narrator looks around the room to observe everyone and try to figure them \nout. He cannot, deciding they are too different, too fluid. He decides that he too is different and changes all the time. He \ndecides he should not make anyone angry, since he is to be the new leader.<PARAGRAPH>Outside, the narrator is surrounded by a crowd of people anxious to hear him speak. Clifton\u2019s youth division of the \nBrotherhood surrounds him. Ras the Exhorter and his violent gang of activists show up and begin to fight. The narrator is \nhit in the head and falls. He sees Ras pull a knife on Clifton but stop in mid-air. Ras lets Clifton go because he is black. \nRas tries to convince Clifton and the narrator that they are traitors to the black people by helping ex-slave holders and \ncalling them brothers, for there are white men in the Brotherhood. Ras goes on to explain that white men will only call \nthem brothers long enough to achieve their goals. He pleads with them to believe him, even moved to tears. The narrator \nresponds carefully, telling Ras they will not go away, and they want no more trouble with him or his nationalists.<PARAGRAPH>Clifton and the narrator leave, talking as they go about how Jack will respond \n        to the violence, which is strictly against Brotherhood policy. Clifton \n        halfway admits to believing some of Ras' philosophy, revealing that he \n        sometimes feels he has turned his back on the black people in some manner. \n        He tells the narrator he does not know any other way of fighting for his \n        cause, revealing that if he allowed himself to get as angry as Ras, he \n        might lose control and kill someone. The narrator is mostly silent, finally \n        saying he is glad the Brotherhood can help them fight for their cause.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Invisible_Man_Ellison/Invisible_Man_Study_Guide16.html"}
