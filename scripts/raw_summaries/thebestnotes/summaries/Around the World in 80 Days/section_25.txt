{"name": "chapter 21", "summary": "The journey of the Tankadere is described in this \nchapter. Fogg asks John Bunsby to make the ship move as fast as possible. Fix \nin the meanwhile was worrying about his next course of action. In the night the \nwind begins to blow and continues during the next day. Aouda and Fogg were not \nsea sick but Fix didn\u2019t feel too well. The ship moved well and Bunsby hoped to \nreach Shanghai in time. Then the ship gets caught in a gale and the wind pushes \nthe vessel northward. Aouda and Fogg face the storm bravely. Fogg insists that \nthey will not take the ship to port, but shall move towards Shanghai. The Tankadere \nremained at sea, despite the furious storm. When the ship has barely a day left, \nthey are still a distance away from Shanghai. Everybody on board is in a state \nof suspense as to whether they\u2019ll reach, in time to board the next ship. When \nthey are three miles from Shanghai, they see the American liner leaving at the \nappointed time. Fogg asks Bunsby to signal the ship and he lowers his flag to \nhalf-mast. They hoped that the American ship would alter her course for a moment \nso as to stand by the pilot boat.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nThe journey \non the Tankadere is quite an adventure. Initially, the wind and the currents help \nthe Tankadere move towards Shanghai at a great pace. This is supported by the \nefficiency of the little ship Tankadere, which is handled admirably by its Captain-John \nBunsby.<PARAGRAPH>But later, the little ship is overtaken by a terrible storm. We \nsee that Fogg never ever gives up and when the pilot asks him whether they should \nstop the ship at a port all he says is that the only port for him is Shanghai. \nBunsby seems to understand Fogg\u2019s way of functioning and they can both operate \nat the same level. That is not in the case of the Captain that comes later in \nthe book and is named Andrew Speedy. This character clashes with Fogg, unlike \nJohn Bunsby who thinks in the same way as Fogg.<PARAGRAPH>Aouda comes across as \nthe ideal woman for a man like Fogg. She is completely impassive and is not afraid \nof the storm. She faces it bravely. Meanwhile, Fix feels very small as he is in \ngreat debt to Fogg, who gives him a place on the ship Tankadere. When Fix asks \nFogg whether he can pay some money for the ship travel, Fogg refuses. This must \nhave made Fix feel even smaller as he has plans to arrest the very same man, who \nis being so generous to him.<PARAGRAPH>The suspense that is built among the voyagers \nreaches the readers as well. We are all curious as to whether the Tankadere shall \nreach Shanghai on time. We see Fogg makes his own Fate and is not swayed by circumstances. \nWhen he sees the American ship leaving the port, he asks the little ship master-Bunsby \nto signal it. They do that and we wait to see whether the bigger ship shall respond. \nBy now, we recognize Fogg\u2019s calm demeanor and never say die spirit.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days23.html"}
