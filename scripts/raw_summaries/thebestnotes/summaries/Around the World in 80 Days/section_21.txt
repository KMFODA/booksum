{"name": "chapter 17", "summary": "Passepartout begins \nto seriously reflect on the strange chance, which had once more placed Fix on \nthe same route as his master. The valet finally concludes that Fix must be an \nagent sent by Fogg's fellow members of the Reform Club. Fogg goes ashore to Singapore \nto see the island with Aouda. They then continue their journey on the Rangoon \ntowards Hong Kong. But this journey is not too smooth and Passepartout is very \nimpatient. He quizzes Fix on the coincidence that Fix is always travelling with \nthem. Fix returns to his cabin perplexed as to how he should now deal with Passepartout. \nMeanwhile, the valet starts noticing Aouda's love for Fogg. While Fogg always \nlooks unperturbed. Passepartout is angry at the inefficiency of the large ship-Rangoon.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nFinally, Passepartout begins to question the \nfact that Fix is always around them. We are glad that he starts thinking along \nthese lines as we, as readers, know that Fix is against the hero and that he must \nbe caught. But Passepartout being the simpleton that he is, comes to the convenient \nconclusion that Fix is an agent of the Reform Club members and that he has been \nasked to follow Fogg around the world. Passepartout is convinced of this idea \nand even teases Fix on the fact that he is always travelling with them. Fix laughs \nwith Passepartout on that occasion but he is deeply troubled inside. He is worried \nwhether Fogg too has been told about Passsepartout's suspicion. He cannot understand \nwhat part Passepartout plays in this game and whether he is aware that his master \nis a bank robber.<PARAGRAPH>What is interesting to note is Fogg's calm in the midst \nof disturbed thoughts. While Passepartout is suspicious of Fix and worried about \nthe ship's progress and Fix is anxious about what he should do next; Fogg is completely \nunruffled. He is a logical man, who has complete faith in rationality and does \nnot depend too much on unpredictable human notions. Fix makes up his mind to deal \nwith Passepartout frankly.<PARAGRAPH>The island of Singapore is described in a few \nparagraphs and in the meanwhile, Aouda develops love for Fogg. Passepartout is \ndisappointed that Fogg is not reciprocating this love but as we learn later Fogg \ndoes love Aouda but is not too effusive about his feelings. This romantic angle \nthat Verne adds to the story keeps the interest of the reader excited.<PARAGRAPH>This chapter focuses on the journey on the Rangoon from Singapore to Hong Kong. \nThere are some important developments in the relationships of the characters with \neach other.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days21.html"}
