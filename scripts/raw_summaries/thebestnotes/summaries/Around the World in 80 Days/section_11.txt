{"name": "chapter 7", "summary": "The detective passed down the quay, and made his way to the consul\u2019s \noffice. He told the Consul that he thought that the robber was on the Mongolia. \nThe consul said that the robber might not come to the consulate, as it was not \nnecessary to get the passport countersigned. But, Fix feels otherwise and says \nthat he hopes that the Consul will not visa the passport. \"Why not? If the \npassport is genuine I have no right to refuse.\" Fix wants to keep the robber \nhere till he can get the warrant.<PARAGRAPH>Two strangers enter the Consul\u2019s room \nas Fix and the Consul are conversing, one of who was the servant whom Fix had \nmet on the quay and the other, who was his master, held out his passport with \nthe request that the consul would do him the favor to visa it. The consul took \nthe document and carefully read it, whilst Fix observed from afar. The consul \njust asked a few questions before agreeing to visa Fogg\u2019s passport. The consul \nproceeded to sign and date the passport. Mr. Fogg paid the customary fee, coldly \nbowed, and went out, followed by his servant. The consul feels that Fogg looks \nlike an honest man and doubts that descriptions can be totally trusted - even \nif Fogg does look like the robber, he may not be one. Fix decides to find out \nby getting Passepartout to talk, as he believes that a Frenchman cannot resist \nopening his mouth. Fix starts off in search of Passepartout.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile \nMr. Fogg, after leaving the consulate, repaired to the quay, gave some orders \nto Passepartout and went off to the Mongolia.<PARAGRAPH>In his cabin, Fogg fed the \njourney dates into an itinerary divided into columns, indicating the month, the \nday of the month, and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal \npoint - Paris, Brindisi, Suez, Bombay, Calcutta, Singapore, Hong Kong, Yokohama, \nSan Francisco, New York, and London from the 2 nd of October to the \n21 st of December. This methodical record thus contained an account \nof everything needed, and Mr. Fogg always knew whether he was behind or in advance \nof his time. On this Friday, October 9 th , he noted his arrival at \nSuez, and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost. He sat down quietly \nto breakfast in his cabin, never once thinking of inspecting the town, being one \nof those Englishmen who are wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of \ntheir domestics.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nFix is excited that he has got the robber and immediately \nleaves for the Consulate, where he is at once admitted to the presence of that \nofficial. Fix is a detective who knows how to go about his work, the only problem \nbeing that he is too hasty to assume that he does have the right robber at hand. \nFix and the Consul have the following conversation - \"Consul,\" said \nhe, without preamble, \"I have strong reasons for believing that my man is \na passenger on the Mongolia.\" And he narrated what had just passed concerning \nthe passport. \"Well, Mr. Fix,\" replied the consul, \"I shall not \nbe sorry to see the rascal\u2019s face; but perhaps he won\u2019t come here that is, if \nhe is the person you suppose him to be. A robber doesn\u2019t quite like to leave traces \nof his flight behind him; and, besides, he is not obliged to have his passport \ncountersigned.\" \"If he is as shrewd as I think he is, consul, he will \ncome.\"<PARAGRAPH>\u2018To have his passport visaed?\"<PARAGRAPH>\"Yes. Passports \nare only good for annoying honest folks, and aiding in the flight of rogues. I \nassure you it will be quite the thing for him to do; but I hope you will not visa \nthe passport.\"<PARAGRAPH>Fix is a persistent man who often uses all his nudging \nskills to get his work done. In this case, he tries to urge the Consul to keep \nFogg at the consulate till Fix can obtain a warrant to arrest Fogg.<PARAGRAPH>Fix \nsays - \"Still, I must keep this man here until I can get a warrant to arrest \nhim from London.\"<PARAGRAPH>The consul replies -\"Ah, that\u2019s your lookout. \nBut I cannot--\"<PARAGRAPH>Their conversation is interrupted by the entrance \nof Fogg with Passerpartout. Fix moves to the side of the room and devours the \nstranger with his eyes from there.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg and the consul have an amiable \nand official conversation. The consul comes across as a reasonable man who minds \nhis own business and who is not unnecessarily suspicious. The consul informs Fogg \nthat a passport and a visa is not required for an Englishman travelling to Bombay. \nTo this Fogg replies that he required a visa endorsement in order to prove that \nhe had come by the Suez. The consul visas the passport without any hesitancy, \nas it is legally right. Fix of course would have been angry to see his suspected \nrobber move away without any difficulty.<PARAGRAPH>Later when Fix refers to the \nresemblance between Fogg and the description of the bank robber received by him, \nthe consul remarks all descriptions are not to be trusted completely. Detective \nFix then remarks, \"The servant seems to me less mysterious than the master; \nbesides, he\u2019s a Frenchman, and can\u2019t help talking. Excuse me for a little while, \nconsul.\" Throughout the story we see how Fix does not hesitate in resorting \nto unscrupulous methods in order to prevent Fogg from taking his journey around \nthe world. Fix gets friendly with Passepartout with the sole purpose of getting \ninformation on Fogg. Later, he even gets Passepartout intoxicated with opium so \nthat the man is unable to inform his master about the departure time of a particular \nship. Fix may be a detective and on the side of the law, but we see how he resorts \nto unfair means.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, Fogg continues in his calm, unruffled manner. \nHe seems to be a celebration of all that a civilized man is supposed to denote. \nHe goes to his cabin and takes up his note-book, which contained the following \nmemoranda: --\"Left London, Wednesday, October 2 nd , at 8.45 p.m. \n\u2018Reached Paris, Thursday, October 3 rd , at 7.20 a.m. \u2018Left Paris, \nThursday, at 8.40 a.m.<PARAGRAPH>\"Reached Turin by Mont Cenis, Friday, October \n4 th , at 6.35 a.m. \u2018Left Turin, Friday, at 7.20 a.m.<PARAGRAPH>\"Arrived \nat Brindisi, Saturday, October 5 th , at 4 p.m. \"Sailed on the \nMongolia, Saturday, at 5 p.m. \"Reached Suez, Wednesday, October 9 th \n, at 11 a.m. \"Total of hours spent, 158\u00bd; or, in days, six days and \na half.\"<PARAGRAPH>Through these entries we realize just how methodical a man \nFogg really is. He even had a space in this intricate column for setting down \nthe gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality.<PARAGRAPH>So far, \nFogg has succeeded in jumping mathematically from trains to ships. We are curious \nto know whether Fogg can continue his journey with such efficiency.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days12.html"}
