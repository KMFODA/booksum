{"name": "chapter 11", "summary": "The train started punctually. Among the passengers were a number of officers, \ngovernment officials, and opium and indigo merchants. Passepartout rode in the \nsame carriage with his master, and a third passenger occupied a seat opposite \nto them. This was Sir Francis Cromarty, one of Mr. Fogg\u2019s whist partners on the \nMongolia. Sir Francis knew a lot about India but Fogg was not interested in knowing \nanything from the former. Sir Francis Cromarty had observed the oddity of his \ntravelling companion although the only opportunity he had for studying him had \nbeen while he was dealing the cards, and between two rubbers and questioned himself \nwhether a human heart really beat beneath this cold exterior, and whether Phileas \nFogg had any sense of the beauties of nature. The brigadier general was free to \nmentally confess that, of all the eccentric persons he had ever met, none was \ncomparable to this product of the exact sciences. Phileas Fogg had not concealed \nfrom Sir Francis his design of going round the world and the general only saw \nin the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of sound common sense. In the way \nthis strange gentleman was going on, he would leave the world without having done \nany good to himself or anybody else.<PARAGRAPH>The course of the train is described \nalong with the scanty conversation that Fogg has with Comarty. Comarty warns Fogg \nthat the latter might get into trouble because of Passepartout\u2019s entering the \nholy pagoda at Bombay. Fogg feels that his servant\u2019s mistake cannot harm him in \nany way. Passepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realize that he was \nactually crossing India in a railway train. The land through which the train passes \nis described here.<PARAGRAPH>At half past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor, \nwhere Passepartout was able to purchase some Indian slippers, ornamented with \nfalse pearls, in which, he proceeded to encase his feet. The travelers made a \nhasty breakfast and started off for Assurghur, after skirting for a little the \nbanks of the small river Tapty, which empties into the Gulf of Cambray, near Surat. \nPassepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie. He worried about the wager \nand whether Fogg would be able to complete his mission. He realizes that this \nis not a jest and that his master is serious about traversing the globe.<PARAGRAPH>The train stopped, at eight o\u2019clock, in the midst of a glade some fifteen miles \nbeyond Rothal, where there were several bungalows, and workmen\u2019s cabins. The conductor, \npassing along the carriages, shouted, \"Passengers will get out here!\" \nPhileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation; but the general \ncould not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of dates and acacias. \nPassepartout, not less surprised, rushed out and speedily returned, crying: \"Monsieur, \nno more railway!\" They learn that the rail has not been lain from this place \ntill Allahabad and so the passengers will have to find their own way to Allahabad \nand from there they can once again board a train to Calcutta. While Sir Francis \nand Passepartout are very angry, Fogg is calm and looks for a means of transport.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout finds an elephant and they all go to have a look at it. They \nsoon reach a small hut, near which, enclosed within some high palings, was the \nanimal in question. Kiouni this was the name of the beast could doubtless travel \nrapidly for a long time, and, in default of any other means of conveyance, Mr. \nFogg resolved to hire him. But, the mahout was unwilling to hire out the elephant \neven at a high price. Phileas Fogg, without getting in the least flurried, then \nproposed to purchase the animal outright, and at first offered a thousand pounds \nfor him. Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to reflect before \nhe went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit \nof acting rashly, that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake, that the \nelephant was absolutely necessary to him, and that he would secure him if he had \nto pay twenty times his value. At two thousand pounds the Indian yielded.<PARAGRAPH>They found a guide easily. A young Parsee, with an intelligent face, offered his \nservices, which Mr. Fogg accepted, promising a generous reward as to stimulate \nhis zeal. The elephant was led out and equipped. Phileas Fogg paid the Indian \nwith some banknotes, which he extracted from the famous carpet bag. Then Fogg \noffered to carry Sir Francis to Allahabad, which the brigadier gratefully accepted. \nProvisions were purchased at Kholby, and, while Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg took \nthe howdahs on either side, Passepartout got astride the saddle cloth between \nthem. The Parsee perched himself on the elephant\u2019s neck, and at nine o\u2019clock they \nset out from the village, the animal marching off through the dense forest of \npalms by the shortest cut.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nIn this chapter, \nFogg\u2019s and Passepartout\u2019s journey by train is described. One of their companions \nis Sir Francis, who was with them on the ship too. He was now on his way to join \nhis corps at Benares. Verne manages to create miniature life size pictures of \nthe characters that Fogg comes across in his journey. He writes about Sir Francis \nthat he was a tall, fair man of fifty, who had greatly distinguished himself in \nthe last Sepoy revolt. He made India his home, only paying brief visits to England \nat rare intervals; and was almost as familiar as a native with the customs, history, \nand character of India and its people.<PARAGRAPH>But Phileas Fogg, who was not travelling, \nbut only describing a circumference, took no pains to inquire into these subjects; \nhe was a solid body, traversing an orbit around the terrestrial globe, according \nto the laws of rational mechanics. He was at this moment calculating in his mind \nthe number of hours spent since his departure from London, and, had it been in \nhis nature to make a useless demonstration, would have rubbed his hands for satisfaction. \nVerne successfully contrasts Sir Francis with Fogg - one who is more of a sociological \ncreature and the other who is more didactic and rational.<PARAGRAPH>We get a view \nof the passing Indian landscape - An hour after leaving Bombay the train had passed \nthe viaducts and the Island of Salcette, and had got into the open country. At \nCallyan they reached the junction of the branch line, which descends towards southeastern \nIndia by Kandallah and Pounah; and, passing Pauwell, they entered the defiles \nof the mountains, with their basalt bases, and their summits crowned with thick \nand verdant forests. Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty exchanged a few words \nfrom time to time, and now Sir Francis, reviving the conversation, observed, \"Some \nyears ago, Mr. Fogg, you would have met with a delay at this point which would \nprobably have lost you your wager.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"How so, Sir Francis?\" \n\"Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains, which the passengers \nwere obliged to cross in palanquins or on ponies to Kandallah, on the other side.\" \n\"Such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the least,\" said Mr. \nFogg. \"I have constantly foreseen the likelihood of certain obstacles.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"But, Mr. Fogg,\" pursued Sir Francis, \"you run the risk \nof having some difficulty about this worthy fellow\u2019s adventure at the pagoda.\"<PARAGRAPH>We note how unsurprised and rational Fogg appears at all occasions. Whenever \nchallenged with a proposition or faced with a new idea, he calmly inquires more \nabout it without showing any signs of excitement or agitation.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, \nPassepartout - his feet comfortably wrapped in his travelling-blanket, was sound \nasleep and did not dream that anybody was talking about him. He is a gentle source \nof comedy throughout the novel - his blustering ways, his innocence, his agility \nas a ex-circus man, his sincerity, his follies are all characteristics that endear \nhim to the reader. Sir Francis tells Fogg that the Government is very severe upon \nthat kind of offence and that it takes particular care that the religious customs \nof the Indians should be respected. He warns Fogg of the dangers of punishment \nif Passepartout were caught. \"Very well, Sir Francis,\" replied Mr. Fogg; \n\"if he had been caught he would have been condemned and punished, and then \nwould have quietly returned to Europe. I don\u2019t see how this affair could have \ndelayed his master.\" Fogg\u2019s reply as usual is unruffled and confident. He \nseems to be able to anticipate all problems and find solutions to all of them \ntoo.<PARAGRAPH>During the night, the train left the mountains behind, and passed \nNassik, and the next day proceeded over the flat, well-cultivated country of the \nKhandeish, with its straggling villages, above which rose the minarets of the \npagodas. Numerous small rivers water this fertile territory along with limpid \nstreams, mostly tributaries of the Godavery. The Indian land is portrayed as a \nwild and exotic one - such a description was typical of the English writing about \nIndia. Verne writes - \" The locomotive, guided by an English engineer and \nfed with English coal, threw out its smoke upon cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, \nand pepper plantations, while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm \ntrees, in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows, viharis (sort of \nabandoned monasteries), and marvelous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation \nof Indian architecture. Then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon, \nwith jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers, which fled at the noise of the train; \nsucceeded by forests penetrated by the railway, and still haunted by elephants \nwhich, with pensive eyes, gazed at the train as it passed. The travelers crossed, \nbeyond Milligaum, the fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries \nof the goddess Kali. Not far off rose Ellora, with its graceful pagodas, and the \nfamous Aurungabad, capital of the ferocious Aureng-Zeb, now the chief town of \none of the detached provinces of the kingdom of the Nizam. It was thereabouts \nthat Feringhea, the Thuggee chief, king of the stranglers, held his sway. These \nruffians, united by a secret bond, strangled victims of every age in honor of \nthe goddess Death, without ever shedding blood; there was a period when this part \nof the country could scarcely be traveled over without corpses being found in \nevery direction. The English Government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these \nmurders, though the Thuggees still exist, and pursue the exercise of their horrible \nrites.\"<PARAGRAPH>We get a glimpse into the simple Passepartout\u2019s mind - Up \nto his arrival at Bombay, he had entertained hopes that their journey would end \nthere; but, now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed, a \nsudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams. His old vagabond nature \nreturned to him; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of \nhim. He came to regard his master\u2019s project as intended in good earnest, believed \nin the reality of the bet, and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity \nof making it without fail within the designated period. Already he began to worry \nabout possible delays, and accidents, which might happen on the way. He recognized \nhimself as being personally interested in the wager, and trembled at the thought \nthat he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the \nnight before. Being much less cool-headed than Mr. Fogg, he was much more restless, \ncounting and recounting the days passed over, uttering maledictions when the train \nstopped, and accusing it of sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not \nhaving bribed the engineer. The worthy fellow was ignorant that, while it was \npossible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer, it could not be done on \nthe railway.<PARAGRAPH>The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which \nseparate the Khandeish from Bundelcund, towards evening. The next day Sir Francis \nCromarty asked Passepartout what time it was; to which, on consulting his watch, \nhe replied that it was three in the morning. This famous timepiece, always regulated \non the Greenwich meridian, which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward, \nwas at least four hours slow. Sir Francis corrected Passepartout\u2019s time, whereupon \nthe latter made the same remark that he had done to Fix; and obstinately refused \nto alter his watch, which he kept at London time. It was an innocent delusion \nthat could harm no one. Though the reference to the change in time as one travels \nis not taken too seriously by the reader here, at the end of the novel we understand \nthe importance of these various references. Previously, even Fix had pointed out \nthe error in Passepartout\u2019s watch\u2019s time. Both Fogg and Passepartout think that \nthey have reached England late but the reality is that they reach a day earlier \nas they had not realized that they had gained a day by travelling eastward.<PARAGRAPH>When the train stops in the wilderness, we once again note the contrast between \nSir Francis and Fogg. The general at once stepped out, while Phileas Fogg calmly \nfollowed him, and they proceeded together to the conductor. \"Where are we?\" \nasked Sir Francis. \"At the hamlet of Kholby.\" \"Do we stop here?\" \n\"Certainly. The railway isn\u2019t finished.\" \"What! not finished?\" \n\"No. There\u2019s still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here to Allahabad, \nwhere the line begins again.\u2019\u2019 The fact is that though the papers announced the \nopening of the railway throughout, the papers were mistaken. \"Yet you sell \ntickets from Bombay to Calcutta,\" retorted Sir Francis, who was growing warm. \n\"No doubt,\" replied the conductor; \"but the passengers know that \nthey must provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to Allahabad.\" \nSir Francis was furious. Passepartout would willingly have knocked the conductor \ndown, and did not dare to look at his master. But, Fogg is calm and says quietly \n- \"Sir Francis, we will, if you please, look about for some means of conveyance \nto Allahabad.\"<PARAGRAPH>The reader almost claps when Fogg once again says \nthat even this delay was foreseen. It is not that Fogg knew about the unfinished \nrail but he knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or later arise on his \nroute. Nothing, therefore, was lost. Fogg is confident of reaching Calcutta by \ntime. There was nothing to say to so confident a response.<PARAGRAPH>Verne masters \nthe art of first presenting a perspective through the people involved and then \nobjectively, through a higher point of view. It was but too true that the railway \ncame to a termination at this point. The papers were like some watches, which \nhave a way of getting too fast, and had been premature in their announcement of \nthe completion of the line. The greater part of the travelers were aware of this \ninterruption, and, leaving the train, they began to engage such vehicles as the \nvillage could provide - four-wheeled palkigharis, wagons drawn by zebus, carriages \nthat looked like perambulating pagodas, palanquins, ponies, and what not.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg and Sir Francis\u2019s search proves futile for some time and then Passepartout \nfinds an elephant. We notice that Fogg never rejects any outlandish idea. He has \nan open mind and is keen to have a look at the elephant immediately. An Indian \ncame out of the hut, and, at their request, conducted them within the enclosure. \nThe elephant, which its owner had reared, not for a beast of burden, but for warlike \npurposes, was half domesticated. The Indian had begun already, by often irritating \nhim, and feeding him every three months on sugar and butter, to impart to him \na ferocity not in his nature, this method being often employed by those who train \nthe Indian elephants for battle. Happily, however, for Mr. Fogg, the animal\u2019s \ninstruction in this direction had not gone far, and the elephant still preserved \nhis natural gentleness.<PARAGRAPH>We are indeed impressed by Verne\u2019s knowledge of \nIndia as well as all the other parts of the world that Fogg passes through. We \nwonder whether the character of Fogg is a reflection of his creator - Verne himself. \nVerne writes - \" But elephants are far from cheap in India, where they are \nbecoming scarce, the males, which alone are suitable for circus shows, are much \nsought, especially as but few of them are domesticated. When therefore Mr. Fogg \nproposed to the Indian to hire Kiouni, he refused point-blank. Mr. Fogg persisted, \noffering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to \nAllahabad. Refused. Twenty pounds? Refused also. Forty pounds? Still refused. \nPassepartout jumped at each advance; but the Indian declined to be tempted. Yet \nthe offer was an alluring one, for, supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours \nto reach Allahabad, his owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling.\"<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Fogg buys the elephant at a very expensive price. \"What \na price, good heavens!\" cried Passepartout, \"for an elephant. Passepartout \nseems more concerned about his master\u2019s money than Fogg himself. Passepartout\u2019s \ndiscomfort at the spending of huge amounts of money never fails to amuse the reader. \nAfter the party purchases the elephant, they proceed to find a mahout who can \ncontrol the elephant till Allahabad. They find a Parsee. The Parsee, who was an \naccomplished elephant driver, covered the elephant\u2019s back with a sort of saddle-cloth, \nand attached to each of his flanks some curiously uncomfortable howdahs. Thus, \nSir Francis, Passepartout and Fogg seat themselves on an elephant and are off. \nThe story is so remarkably written that the reader feels that he/ she too is travelling \naround the world.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days16.html"}
