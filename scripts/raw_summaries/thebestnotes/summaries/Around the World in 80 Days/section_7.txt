{"name": "chapter 3", "summary": "Phileas Fogg, reached the Reform Club, an imposing edifice in Pall \nMall. He repaired at once to the dining room and took his place at the habitual \ntable. His breakfast is minutely described. He then spent a considerable amount \nof time reading newspapers. Dinner passed as breakfast had done, and Mr. Fogg \nreappeared in the reading room. Mr. Fogg\u2019s usual partners at whist appear and \nthey all begin to discuss a famous robbery that had recently taken place at a \nbank in London. Phileas joins this conversation when he says that - \u2018The Daily \nTelegraph says that he (the robber) is a gentleman.\"<PARAGRAPH>The affair, \nwhich formed the subject, was this - A package of banknotes, to the value of fifty-five \nthousand pounds, had been taken from the principal cashier\u2019s table. When the money \nwas not found even at five o\u2019clock, the amount was passed to the account of profit \nand loss. As soon as the robbery was discovered, picked detectives hastened off \nto various ports, inspired by the proffered reward of two thousand pounds, and \nfive per cent on the sum that might be recovered. There were real grounds for \nsupposing that the thief did not belong to a professional band but was a gentleman. \nThe papers and clubs were full of the affair, and everywhere people were discussing \nthe probabilities of a successful pursuit; and the Reform Club was especially \nagitated, several of its members being Bank officials.<PARAGRAPH>Ralph and Stuart, \nboth whist players argue whether the thief would be caught or not. Stuart questions \n- \u2018Where could he (the thief) go, then?\u2019\u2019 Ralph replies - \"Oh, I don\u2019t know \nthat. The world is big enough.\" It is here that Fogg once again joins the \nconversation, when he says - \"It was once,\". Phileas Fogg is questioned \nas to what he means by \u2018once\u2019 and then the conversation proceeds in such a way \nthat Mr. Fogg declares that it is possible to go around the world in eighty days. \nJohn Sullivan supports this conjecture and shows the group the estimate made by \nthe Daily Telegraph that claims that a journey round the world can be done in \neighty days. Mr. Stuart thinks that the journey may sound plausible theoretically \nbut is not feasible practically. He dares Mr. Fogg to complete such a feat himself \nand in his excitement, he puts a wager of four thousand. Phileas Fogg insists \nthat he can carry out the exercise and says - \"A true Englishman doesn\u2019t \njoke when he is talking about so serious a thing as a wager,\" He bets twenty \nthousand pounds against anyone that he will make the tour of the world in eighty \ndays or less. \"We accept,\" replied Messrs. Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan, \nFlanagan, and Ralph, after consulting each other.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Fogg decides to take the train to Dover that very evening \nand tells his challengers that he would be back in the Reform Club, on Saturday, \nthe 21 st of December.<PARAGRAPH>A memorandum of the wager was at once \ndrawn up and signed by the six parties. The party offered to suspend the game \nso that Mr. Fogg might make his preparations for departure but the latter is calm \nand insists on playing some more.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nJules \nVerne greatly emphasizes the accuracy with which Mr. Fogg goes about his every \nday activities. In the very starting of the third chapter, he writes - \"... \nhaving shut the door of his house at half past eleven, and having put his right \nfoot before his left five hundred and seventy-five times, and his left foot before \nhis right five hundred and seventy-six times...\" Mr. Fogg reached the Reform \nClub. The reader reads about Fogg\u2019s slightly eccentric, yet accurate habits. We \nrealize that he is a man of class and apparently has very good taste.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Fogg\u2019s passion is the game of whist and this is one thing that cannot be carried \nout alone. His fellow whist players at the club join him. The conversation revolves \naround a recent robbery at the Bank of England. Jules Verne assures that the reader \nalways remains interested in what he/ she is reading. We now hear about an interesting \nrobbery and observe that in any discussion, Mr. Fogg always assumes a quiet and \nsuperior position.<PARAGRAPH>Jules Verne maintains a ready account of life in England \nin the first few chapters. His characters are not represented in isolation, they \nare a part of a large, living civilization. He writes - \" Let it be observed \nthat the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the honesty of the public. \nThere are neither guards nor gratings to protect its treasures; gold, silver, \nbanknotes are freely exposed, at the mercy of the first comer. A keen observer \nof English customs relates that, being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day, \nhe had the curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds. \nHe took it up, scrutinized it, passed it to his neighbor, he to the next man, \nand so on until the ingot, going from hand to hand, was transferred to the end \nof a dark entry; nor did it return to its place for half an hour. Meanwhile, the \ncashier had not so much as raised his head...\"<PARAGRAPH>It is interesting \nto note that the author writes that on the day of the robbery a well dressed gentleman \nof polished manners, and with a well to do air, had been observed going to and \nfro in the paying room where the crime was committed. In the previous two chapters, \nwe have read about Mr. Fogg\u2019s immaculate appearance, gentlemanly ways and mysterious \nsource of wealth. When we read that a probable suspect for the robbery is a well-dressed \nman, we wonder whether Mr. Fogg is the high society robber. In this way, Mr. Verne \nmanages to keep us curious.<PARAGRAPH>A description of the well-dressed suspect \nof the robbery was easily procured and sent to the detectives. On this fact, a \ndebate started amongst the whist players. Ralph would not concede that the work \nof the detectives was likely to be in vain, for he thought that the prize offered \nwould greatly stimulate their zeal and activity. But Stuart was far from sharing \nthis confidence; and, as they placed themselves at the whist table, they continued \nto argue the matter. Stuart and Flanagan played together, while Phileas Fogg had \nFallentin for his partner. As the game proceeded the conversation ceased, excepting \nbetween the rubbers, when it revived again.<PARAGRAPH>The main theme of the novel \nis introduced in this third chapter - the question of the plausibility of a journey \naround the world in eighty days. Fogg believes that it is entirely possible whereas \nthe other whist players oppose this idea. Stuart claims that it might be possible \nto go around in eighty days, but that doesn\u2019t take into account bad weather, contrary \nwinds, shipwrecks, railway accidents, and so on.<PARAGRAPH>\"All included,\" \nreturned Phileas Fogg, continuing to play despite the discussion.<PARAGRAPH>\"But \nsuppose the Hindoos or Indians pull up the rails,\" replied Stuart; \"suppose \nthey stop the trains, pillage the luggage vans, and scalp the passengers!\"<PARAGRAPH>\"All included,\" calmly retorted Fogg; adding, as he threw down \nthe cards, \"Two trumps.\" Mr. Fogg appears clam and rational throughout. \nHe comes across, as a man who would not speak through his hat, who would be able \nto act out that which he said was possible. Indeed, his very character seems to \nbe stand for the celebration of rationality and order. He is the new age man, \na product of industrialization.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Fogg\u2019s supreme confidence irritates \nStuart, who bets a wager that Fogg himself will not be able to go around the world \nin eighty days. Fogg says in reply - \"I should like nothing better.\" \nHe adds that he is ready to leave immediately and warns them that the feat will \nbe carried out at their expense. We note that while Mr. Fogg is saying all this, \nhe maintains a calm demeanor and is not agitated as Mr. Stuart is. He appears \nalmost arrogant and continues playing the game of cards well. He is undoubtedly \nthe unquestioned hero of the journey around the world.<PARAGRAPH>Jules Verne explains \nthat Fogg certainly did not bet to win, and had only staked the twenty thousand \npounds, half of his fortune, because he foresaw that he might have to expend the \nother half to carry out this difficult, not to say unattainable, project. As for \nhis antagonists, they seemed much agitated; not so much by the value of their \nstake, as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult \nto their friend.<PARAGRAPH>The reader is left a little astonished at the pace at \nwhich the story travels. Mr. Fogg has agreed to the challenge and has promised \nto start his journey around the world. The man, who appeared to follow a strict \nschedule within the confines of his house and the club, is now about to set on \na crazy tour around the world. This will surely come as a surprise to Passepartout \nand we see that it does.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days08.html"}
