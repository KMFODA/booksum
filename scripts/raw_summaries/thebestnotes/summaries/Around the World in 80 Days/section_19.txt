{"name": "chapter 15", "summary": "Just as Fogg, Passepartout and Aouda are leaving \nthe Calcutta station a policeman approaches them and asks Fogg and Passepartout \nto accompany him. Aouda too is given permission to accompany Fogg and Passepartout. \nThey are taken in a \u2018palki gari\u2019 to an unpretentious looking house and told that \nthey are to present themselves in front of a judge. When they are presented in \ncourt, the plaintiffs too are brought in and they turn out to be priests. Fogg \nassumes that these are the priests, who tried to sacrifice Aouda in the pagoda \nof Pillagi but he is mistaken. These are actually the priests from the pagoda \nof Bombay who got into a scuffle with Passepartout because he entered the holy \nplace with his shoes on. It is explained by the author that Detective Fix had \ntaken upon himself to advise the priests of Malabar Hill after fully grasping \nall the advantage he could derive from the unfortunate mistake of passepartout\u2019s. \nIt is he who sends the priests in the next train to Calcutta in the pursuit of \nthe culprit. It was Fix who had directed the policeman to take Fogg and Passepartout \ninto custody.<PARAGRAPH>Judge Odadiah takes a note of the confession that had escaped \nPassepartout and condemns him to go to prison for 15 days and to pay a fine of \nthree hundred pounds. Fogg too is condemned to prison and is asked to pay a fine. \nFogg agrees to pay bail for himself and his servant. Passepartout is very disgusted \nwith the fact that his master has to pay such a large sum of money. After taking \nback his shoes, Passepartout follows Fogg out of the courtroom. They immediately \ngo to the Rangoon, the ship that was to leave for Hong Kong. Detective Fix is \nvery angry because of Fogg\u2019s excessive spending. Since a percentage on the recovered \nis assigned as a reward for the detectives, Fix is worried that by the time the \njourney ends and Fogg is caught, there will be a very negligible amount left.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nFogg and Passepartout reach Calcutta along \nwith Aouda. We see that Fogg is in his usual hurry to get on o the next means \nof conveyance to another part of the globe. But, his plans are interrupted by \nthe appearance of a policeman who asks Fogg and Passepartout to follow him. We \nnotice how Fogg takes the utmost care of Aouda and takes her along when they have \nto go with the policeman.<PARAGRAPH>The reader is curious to know why Fogg and Passepartout have been asked to appear \nin court. It crosses our minds that it is to early for Fogg and Passepartout to \nbe challenged by the priests at Pillage who intended to sacrifice Aouda. We are \nnot wrong-the case is not against Fogg and Passepartout for abducting Aouda but \nis against Passepartout for desecrating a holy place. For the first time we see \nthat Fogg is wrong in his assumption about the case slapped against them. He too \nis surprised when the priests claim to have nothing to do with Pillage but maintain \nthat they are from Malabar Hill, Bombay.<PARAGRAPH>When we read that Fogg and Passepartout \nare to be imprisoned for the crime of desecrating a native holy place, we get \nworried about how Fogg will accomplish the challenge to go around the world in \neighty days. But, Fogg is as calm as ever and asks the judge whether he can pay \nbail. He is allowed to do so and parts with a very heavy sum. Passepartout is \npennywise and his heart skips a beat seeing his master having to pay so much. \nPassepartout is not the only one worried about Fogg\u2019s dwindling notes, Fix too \nis very unhappy with the easy manner in which Fogg spends his cash. There is a \nselfish reason behind this-he will get a percentage of the sum being carried by \nthe \u2018thief\u2019 Fogg and the percentage value will go down as the sum value too dwindles.<PARAGRAPH>In this chapter we see just how desperate Fix is to hold on to Fogg. It \nis he who urges the priests to follow Passepartout from Bombay to Calcutta in \norder to prosecute the latter from entering the pagoda with shoes on. Fix comes \nacross as a shrewd man who will do anything to obtain his prey, in this case Fogg, \nwho he thinks is a major bank robber.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg manages to leave the courtroom \nand immediately heads for the Rangoon. The reader is happy to see that Fogg is \non his way once again to fulfill his challenge. Passepartout of course is very \nunhappy. He realizes just how expensive he is proving to be to his master. The \nremarkable thing is that Fogg scarcely reprimands Passepartout for his carelessness.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days20.html"}
