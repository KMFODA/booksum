Betting is revived. A great crowd gathers near the \nReform Club on Saturday evening. In the meantime Fogg\u2019s five fellow club members \nand whist partners come together at the Club. They all discuss whether Fogg will \nbe able to make it on time. They think that he won\u2019t be able to. As their tension \ngrows, they start counting the seconds to the time of the wager. Barely a few \nseconds before Fogg makes his appearance in his usual calm way. Outside the club, \na delirious crowd makes much noise<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nThis is \na rare chapter in the book as in this chapter, the past is related and that too \nin a very curious way.<PARAGRAPH>The chapter begins with a description of the people\u2019s \nsentiments in England. They had stopped betting on Fogg when they found out that \nhe was a suspected looter. But when the real robber is arrested the interest in \nFogg\u2019s journey, around the world is revived. Betting starts once again and there \nis a lot of excitement centered on whether Fogg will be able to complete his journey \nin time or not. Fogg\u2019s fellow whist players gather together at the Club and discuss \nthe possibility of Fogg reaching in time. They try and convince themselves that \nhe won\u2019t be able to make it, but they are wrong. Just before the clock\u2019s hand \nmoves to 8.45 p.m. Fogg walks into the room, where the players had gathered. This \ncomes as a surprise to the readers as well. We had read in the previous chapter, \nthat Fogg has lost his bet. Now, we see that h e has made it to the Club in time. \nThis is a mystery to us and one which is only solved in the next chapter.<PARAGRAPH>What is obvious in this chapter is that Fogg is a hero while the men who are his \nchallengers are quite cowardly. They do not appear as calm and confidant, as our \nhero, Fogg always is.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days32.html"}
