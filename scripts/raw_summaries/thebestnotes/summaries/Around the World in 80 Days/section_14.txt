{"name": "chapter 10", "summary": "Verne writes about the land that Fogg and Passepartout have arrived \nto - India. Verne explains that British India, properly so called, only embraces \nseven hundred thousand square miles. He writes in the present tense that a considerable \nportion of India is still free from British authority; and there are certain ferocious \nrajahs in the interior that are absolutely independent.<PARAGRAPH>Verne goes on \nto write how the means of transportation within the Indian subcontinent have changed \nand become more modern and reliable. Formerly one was obliged to travel in India \nby the old cumbrous methods of going on foot or on horseback, in palanquins or \nunwieldy coaches; now fast steamboats ply on the Indus and the Ganges, and a great \nrailway, with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its route, \ntraverses the peninsula from Bombay to Calcutta in three days. The passengers \nof the Mongolia went ashore at half past four p.m.; at exactly eight the train \nwould start for Calcutta.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Fogg bid goodbye to his whist partners, \nleft the steamer, gave his servant several errands to do and himself went to the \npassport office. Having transacted his business at the passport office, Phileas \nFogg repaired quietly to the railway station, where he ordered dinner. After which \nMr. Fogg quietly continued his dinner. Fix too had gone on shore shortly after \nMr. Fogg, and his first destination was the headquarters of the Bombay police. \nHe found that the passport had not reached the office. Fix was disappointed, and \ntried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the Bombay police but \nwas refused as the matter concerned the London office. Fix decided then to keep \nFogg in sight and he was sure that the latter would remain in Bombay only. Passepartout \nhowever, had no sooner heard his master\u2019s orders on leaving the Mongolia than \nhe saw at once that they were to leave Bombay as they had done Suez and Paris, \nand that the journey would be extended at least as far as Calcutta, and perhaps \nbeyond that place.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout went around the city. It happened to be \nthe day of a Parsee festival. He watched the ceremonies with staring eyes and \ngaping mouth. His curiosity drew him farther off than he intended to go. He espied \nthe splendid pagoda on Malabar Hill. He was ignorant that it is forbidden for \nChristians to enter certain Indian temples, and that even the faithful must not \ngo in without taking off their shoes. The wise policy of the British Government \nseverely punishes a disregard of the practices of the native religions.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout, however, went in like a simple tourist, and was soon lost in admiration \nof the splendid Brahmin ornamentation, which everywhere met his eyes. He suddenly \nfound himself sprawling on the sacred flagging. He looked up to behold three enraged \npriests, who tore off his shoes, and began to beat him with savage exclamations. \nSomehow, he managed to escape. Five minutes before eight, Passepartout, hatless, \nshoeless, rushed breathlessly into the station.<PARAGRAPH>Fix by then had seen that \nMr. Fogg was really going to leave Bombay. He had resolved to follow the supposed \nrobber to Calcutta, and further, if necessary. Passepartout did not observe the \ndetective, but Fix heard him relate his adventures to Mr. Fogg. Fix was on the \npoint of entering another carriage, when an idea struck him, which induced him \nto alter his plan. \"No, I\u2019ll stay,\" he muttered. \"An offence has \nbeen committed on Indian soil. I\u2019ve got my man.\u2019\u2019 Just then the locomotive started \nand the train passed out into the dark night.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nVerne must have had a good knowledge \nof the Indian country. He writes - \" Everybody knows that the great reversed \ntriangle of land, with its base in the north and its apex in the south, which \nis called India, embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles, upon which is \nspread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls. The \nBritish Crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of \nthis vast country, and has a governor general stationed at Calcutta, governors \nat Madras, Bombay, and in Bengal, and a lieutenant governor at Agra.\"<PARAGRAPH>Verne relates the history of the British rule in India. The recounting of the \nantecedents of a place serves to make a credible narrative. Even though Fogg breezes \nthrough most places at a very fast pace, the author manages to present the essence \nof each country to us. It is all the more remarkable that Verne manages to do \nthis is such few words. He writes - \" The celebrated East India Company was \nall powerful from 1756, when the English first gained a foothold on the spot where \nnow stands the city of Madras, down to the time of the great Sepoy insurrection. \nIt gradually annexed province after province, purchasing them of the native chiefs, \nwhom it seldom paid, and appointed the governor general and his subordinates, \ncivil and military. But the East India Company has now passed away, leaving the \nBritish possessions in India directly under the control of the Crown. The aspect \nof the country, as well as the manners and distinctions of race, is daily changing.\"<PARAGRAPH>The reader also gets a comprehensive picture of the route that Fogg will \nbe taking while traversing the vast Indian sub continent. This railway does not \nrun in a direct line across India. The distance between Bombay and Calcutta, as \nthe bird flies, is only from one thousand to eleven hundred miles; but the deflections \nof the road increase this distance by more than a third. The general route of \nthe Great Indian Peninsula Railway is as follows: leaving Bombay, it passes through \nSalcette, crossing to the continent opposite Tannah, goes over the chain of the \nWestern Ghauts, runs thence northeast as far as Burhampoor, skirts the nearly \nindependent territory of Bundelcund, ascends to Allahabad, turns thence eastwardly, \nmeeting the Ganges at Benares, then departs from the river a little, and, descending \nsoutheastward by Burdivan and the French town of Chandernagor, has its terminus \nat Calcutta.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg is a curious man - he is very brisk about his business \nof getting the right ship and train so that he may complete his journey in the \nstipulated time. But, as far as enjoying a particular place is concerned, he is \ncompletely indifferent. As for the wonders of Bombay its famous city hall, its \nsplendid library, its forts and docks, its bazaars, mosques, synagogues, its Armenian \nchurches, and the noble pagoda on Malabar Hill, with its two polygonal towers \nhe cared not a straw to see them. He would not deign to examine even the masterpieces \nof Elephanta, or the mysterious hypogea, concealed southeast from the docks, or \nthose fine remains of Buddhist architecture, the Kanherian grottoes of the island \nof Salcette.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg is not a man any one can easily fool, as we see in the \nfollowing comic episode - Among the dishes served up to him at the railway station, \nthe landlord especially recommended a certain giblet of \"native rabbit,\" \non which he prided himself. Mr. Fogg accordingly tasted the dish, but despite \nits spiced sauce, found it far from palatable. He rang for the landlord, and, \non his appearance, said, fixing his clear eyes upon him, \"Is this rabbit, \nsir?\" \"Yes, my lord,\" the rogue boldly replied, \"rabbit from \nthe jungles.\" \"And this rabbit did not mew when he was killed?\" \n\"Mew, my lord! What, a rabbit mew! I swear to you--\" \"Be so good, \nlandlord, as not to swear, but remember this: cats were formerly considered, in \nIndia, as sacred animals. That was a good time.\u2019 \u2018For the cats, my lord?\" \n\"Perhaps for the travelers as well!\"<PARAGRAPH>As for Fix, he went to \nthe authorities in Bombay and made himself known as a London detective, told his \nbusiness at Bombay, and the position of affairs relative to the supposed robber, \nand nervously asked if a warrant had arrived from London. The reader heaves a \nsigh of relief to know that the warrant has not arrived. Fix of course is most \nfrustrated. Fix did not insist on getting permission to retain Fogg when he saw \nthat it was not forthcoming. He resigned himself to await the arrival of the important \ndocument; but he was determined not to lose sight of the mysterious rogue as long \nas he stayed in Bombay. He did not doubt for a moment, any more than Passepartout, \nthat Phileas Fogg would remain there, at least until it was time for the warrant \nto arrive. In the meanwhile, Passerpartout realizes that his master is not going \nto be stopping at Bombay. He began to ask himself if this bet that Mr. Fogg talked \nabout was not really in good earnest, and whether his fate was not in truth forcing \nhim, despite his love of repose, around the world in eighty days!<PARAGRAPH>Having \npurchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes, the valet took a leisurely promenade \nabout the streets, where crowds of people of many nationalities Europeans, Persians \nwith pointed caps, Banyas with round turbans, Sindes with square bonnets, Parsees \nwith black mitres, and long-robed Armenians were collected. On that day was a \nParsee festival. These descendants of the sect of Zoroaster the most thrifty, \ncivilized, intelligent, and austere of the East Indians, among whom are counted \nthe richest native merchants of Bombay were celebrating a sort of religious carnival, \nwith processions and shows, in the midst of which Indian dancing girls, clothed \nin rose colored gauze, looped up with gold and silver, danced airily, but with \nperfect modesty, to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout does not realize that he is committing a grave crime when he enters \na holy temple with his shoes on. The priests, for upsetting the sanctity of the \npraying place, attack him. But, the agile Frenchman was soon upon his feet again, \nand lost no time in knocking down two of his long-gowned adversaries with his \nfists and a vigorous application of his toes. He then, rushed out of the pagoda \nas fast as his legs could carry him, and escaped the third priest by mingling \nwith the crowd in the streets. When he manages to reach his master at the station \njust in time for the train to leave and tells him what had transpired, all that \nFogg says coldly is - \"I hope that this will not happen again\". Poor \nPassepartout, quite crestfallen, followed his master without a word.<PARAGRAPH>Fix \nhad been planning to follow Fogg to Calcutta but at the last moment he changes \nhis mind and does not. Another plan is brewing in his head but we will learn of \nit only later. For now, Fogg and Passepartout are seated in a train that speeds \nit\u2019s way to Calcutta.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days15.html"}
