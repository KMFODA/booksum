{"name": "chapter 25", "summary": "Fogg, Aouda and \nPassepartout set foot on American soil. After finding out that the first train \nfor New York would start that evening, Fogg has a whole day to spend in the Californian \ncapital. The city is described through the eyes of Passepartout and what he sees. \nFogg and Aouda rest at a hotel restaurant they go to the consulate and then by \n\u2018chance\u2019 bump into Fix. The detective expresses surprise at seeing Fogg and then \naccompanies Fogg and Aouda in their sauntering. The three of them find themselves \nin the middle of a political meeting and the two opposing parties are those supporting \nMandiboy or Kamerfield respectively. Suddenly the threesome find that they are \nbetween two fires. The two men try their best to defend Aouda. Meanwhile an American \nwith a red goatee raises a fist at Fogg, which the latter misses by chance. Fix \nis hurt. Then the group returns to the International Hotel. When they start moving \ntowards the station, Fogg promises to return to America to avenge the American \nColonel Proctor\u2019s insult. The traveler\u2019s board the train that takes them towards \nNew York.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nFogg now reaches New York. So far \nhis journey is proceeding quite decently. Despite the delays, he is running on \ntime. He is getting closer and closer to England. In this chapter we learn what \ntranspires in San Francisco City. Passepartout is the usual clown and he lands \non American soil with a perfect somersault. Passepartout adds the much needed \nlightheartedness and laughter to this tale of challenge. Fogg of course has only \none goal in mind-to move towards England in a rational manner. He finds out when \nthe next train leaves for New York.<PARAGRAPH>They realize they have a day in this \nAmerican City and they spend it by eating comfortably and then roaming the city \nstreets. Fogg takes good care of Aouda as always but we do not know whether he \nshows any signals of love.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout is as concerned about their trip \nbeing a success as is Fogg. It is Passepartout, who decides that they must buy \nsome arms before boarding the train, because he has heard of the trains being \nheld up by the Sioux and Pawnees. Fogg is as usual unruffled and does not think \nthe loading of arms necessary. At the same time, he gives Passepartout a lot of \nflexibility and lets him do as he pleases. Fogg is genuinely a free willed man \nwho believes in free will for others too.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg and Fix meet at San Francisco. \nThe clever Fix pretends once again that he is surprised to see Fogg. We wonder \nwhy Fogg doesn\u2019t smell a rat. Fogg allows Fix to accompany him and Aouda. The \nthree land up in the middle of a violent political meeting. We see that Fogg is \nfiercely proud about being an Englishman and when a Yankee insults him, he promises \nto come back to America to avenge himself. Fogg has all the characteristic of \na typical, idealized \u2018hero.\u2019 The only difference would be perhaps that he is eccentric \ntoo, unlike most heroes. Fix takes upon himself, a blow intended for Fogg. We \nwonder why Fix is being so generous but we know that his motive is only to get \nFogg to England as soon as possible.<PARAGRAPH>Even though chapters are short Verne \nuses words and paragraphs admirably and manages to pack in a lot of information. \nWe get the essence of San Francisco and its political angst in this chapter.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days25.html"}
