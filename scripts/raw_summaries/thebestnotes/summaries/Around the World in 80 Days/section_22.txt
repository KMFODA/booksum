{"name": "chapter 18", "summary": "The weather is rough in the latter days of the voyage \nto Hong Kong. Fogg remains calm, Passepartout is angry and Fix is delighted at \nthe delay. Passepartout lends a helping hand in the ship. The Rangoon reaches \nHong Kong a day later. A pilot informs Fogg that the Carnatic would leave Hong \nKong for Yokohama and Fogg is pleased as he had thought that he had missed the \nship. Fogg has some hours before boarding the Carnatic, so he takes Aouda to the \nClub Hotel in the meanwhile. He goes to look for her relative in the meanwhile \nbut finds that the latter had left the city. It is decided then that Aouda will \naccompany Fogg to Europe and Passepartout is told to engage three cabins on the \nCarnatic.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nThere are natural delays in Fogg's \njourney and one such impediment is described here. The ship Rangoon is caught \nin a gale and she is delayed as a result. The reaction to this delay is completely \ndifferent in the three people: Fogg, Passepartout and Fix. While Fogg maintains \nhis composure as always, Passepartout is very worried and Fix of course is delighted \nat the delay. Passepartout's behavior makes us smile. While he keeps helping the \ncrew of the ship, he keeps cursing the weather in his characteristic style. Passepartout \nis a sincere and active fellow.<PARAGRAPH>Fix is sly and his one point program is \nto arrest Fogg. The reader too is glad when the Rangoon reaches Hong Kong. Passepartout \nand Fogg are under the impression that they would have missed the connecting ship \nto Yokohama but we see here that Lady Luck is on Fogg's side. The ship is delayed \nby a day and for that reason Fogg has a chance to board it. While he is in Hong \nKong he decides to trace Aouda's uncle but unfortunately the latter has moved \naway from there. Aouda has no choice now but to accompany Fogg to Europe. She \nis self-respecting and does not wish to be a burden on Fogg, but she is told that \nshe is not. We notice that Fogg does not sweet talk but just states his opinion \nmatter of factly. He says-'You abuse nothing, and your presence does not interfere \nin the least with my plan.' Indeed Fogg never ever goes out of his way to be effusive. \nThough the reader might have expected some other emotion from him here, we know \nour matter of fact hero too well by now. Passepartout on the other hand is more \nexpressive about his feelings and is glad that he will not lose the company of \nthe young woman who always treated him with great kindness. So, Aouda is going \nto travel with Fogg once again.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days22.html"}
