{"name": "chapter 29", "summary": "The train pursues its course. Thirteen hundred and \neighty two miles had now been traveled over from San Francisco in three days and \nthree nights. Fogg and his partners were busy with cards, when suddenly Colonel \nProctor is among them. He is rude and sarcastic to Fogg and there is a war of \nwords. Fogg and the Colonel decide to duel with each other and Fogg wants to arrange \nfor a meeting six months hence. But the Colonel wants to fight immediately and \nso they decide to do that at Plum Greek, a train stop.<PARAGRAPH>Fix is to be the \nsecond in the impending duel. But the guard rushes up to them at the station, \nsaying that the train will not be stopping there. The guard suggests that the \nduo should fight in the train itself-in the carriages to the rear. Just before \nFogg and the Colonel commence dueling the air is rent with savage yells and detonations. \nThe train was being attacked by a band of Sioux who were armed with guns. They \nswarm the carriages and a fight between them and the passengers ensues. Aouda \nshowed great courage and defended herself heroically. The guard who was fighting \nbeside Fogg cried that if the train is not stopped, the Sioux would win. Passepartout \nhears this too and manages to slip under the train carriages. He removes the safety \nchains and a violent jolt separates the train and the engine. The train comes \nto a stand still near Kearney Fort station. The soldiers of the fort hear the \nfiring and hurry up and the Sioux scampers away. But when the passengers are counted \non the station platform, it is found that several are missing, including Passepartout.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nVerne never lets the pace of his narrative to lessen or to become boring. \nWe move from one adventure or incident to the next at a speed equivalent to that \nof a train.<PARAGRAPH>In the first part of the chapter, the train\u2019s route is described. \nThe passing landscape is not enjoyed by our travelers as they are busy playing \ncards. Fogg as usual is playing very well, with luck entirely on his side. Aouda, \nFix and Passepartout are happy that Fogg, who is thus distracted, will not meet \nProctor. But, suddenly Proctor appears on the scene and a war of words ensues. \nHe unnecessarily says rude things and Fogg retaliates, as any honorable Englishman \nwould. Even in an argument, Fogg usually has the upper hand because of his calmness. \nHe speaks back but in such a serene manner that it is all the more biting. His \nstrength is his solid control over his nerves, which gives him command over other \npeople and situations too. Fogg is a celebration of the \u2018civilized man.\u2019 Fogg \nrequests Proctor to have a duel with him six months later as he cannot afford \nto lose time on his journey to Europe. Proctor does not accept this proposition, \nthinking it to be an excuse. So Fogg and he agree to have a duel there and then. \nThey get off at Plum Creek station to have their duel but are stopped by a well \nmeaning guard-the train would not be stopping there.<PARAGRAPH>Before getting down \non the Station, Fogg had reassured Aouda that one need never be afraid of blusterers. \nOne can see the flowering of a relationship between our Indian princess and our \nprince of preciseness-Fogg. And till the last minute, Fogg continues to play his \ngame quietly. The guard asks them to fight on the train itself. It is interesting \nto note that everybody on the train is understanding towards two men who wish \nto settle a question of honor with each other. It reflects the thought of society \nat that time and duels were common in the early 1900\u2019s both in America and England.<PARAGRAPH>But just before Fogg and Proctor can start fighting the train is attacked \nby the Sioux. Fogg and Proctor of course get diverted and fight the Sioux instead. \nThis scene is perhaps the most dramatic one in the entire narrative. After all \nhere is true danger in the form of guns and tomahawks wielded by the Sioux. The \npassengers fight back bravely including Aouda. Once again, her qualities are shown \nsuch as equivalent to that of Fogg. She defends herself brilliantly with a revolver. \nThe hero of this chapter though is the clever Passepartout. It is he who uses \nhis acrobatic skills in order to separate the engine and the train. The guard \nhad shouted out to Fogg that if the train was not stopped the Sioux would win. \nPassepartout had heard that cry too and it is he who managed to separate the engine \nand the train. The train comes to a stop near Fort Kearney station and the Sioux \nscamper away in fear of the armed soldiers. But, some passengers are missing, \nincluding the heroic Passepartout.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days28.html"}
