{"name": "chapter 30", "summary": "Three passengers including Passepartout had disappeared. \nSome were wounded including Colonel Proctor. Aouda was safe and Fix had received \na slight wound. Aouda was crying for Passepartout while Fogg was grave. Fogg resolves \nto go looking for the missing Passepartout and he talks to the Captain of Fort \nKearney Station about this. The Captain is initially unwilling to send soldiers \nafter the Sioux in order to find the three missing men but eventually he comes \naround and agrees. Thirty volunteers were chosen to accompany Fogg. Fix is requested \nto stay with Aouda. Fogg offers the soldiers a thousand pounds, if they were to \nsave the prisoners.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg and the soldiers leave and Aouda waits alone \nin a room in the station. Fix worries, frets and fumes over the fact that Fogg \nhas moved away and wonders whether he will come back. In the afternoon the engine \nthat had got detached from the train thunders back with the driver and stoker \nhaving come out of their unconsciousness. The engine is attached to the train \nagain and the train gets ready to leave. Aouda requests the guard to wait but \nhe refuses, as the train is already late. So the train leaves while the detective \nand Aouda stay behind. Afternoon, evening and night pass in relentless, anxious \nwaiting for Fogg and his group\u2019s return. The next morning, the Captain is about \nto send another group of soldiers after the previous group, when the latter group \nreturns. With Fogg and the soldiers, were the three passengers, including Passepartout \nwho had been taken away by the Sioux. Fogg distributes the promised award amongst \nthe soldiers. Passepartout looks out for the train only to be told that it has \nleft. He is disappointed, while Fogg merely asks calmly, when the next train would \nbe coming along.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nIn this chapter the adventure with the Sioux is continued. \nThe passengers see that three others are missing, including Passepartout. Aouda \nexpresses her grief about Passepartout\u2019s absence quite openly and looks very worried. \nAouda as a woman is one who is open with her feelings. She is sensitive and feminine, \na typical heroine. Fogg seems to be concerned about Aouda\u2019s feelings as well as \nof his own. He debates in his mind as to what he should do about Passepartout.<PARAGRAPH>Finally he decides that he must go in search of his loyal valet. We can \nsee that Fogg is not afraid of doing his duty, even if that involves putting his \nlife at stake. He meets the Captain of Fort Kearney Station and asks for some \nmen to be sent after the Sioux. The Captain is reluctant so Fogg decides to go \non his own. The Captain is captured by Fogg\u2019s sense of justice and his valor and \nagrees to send some soldiers with Fogg. Fogg has the kind of personality that \nimpresses others and fills them with a sense of admiration.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg asks \nFix to look after Aouda, while he goes after the Sioux. Fix is reluctant as he \ndoes not wish to let Fogg go but then he agrees. Fix is extremely suspicious of \nFogg but Fogg\u2019s personality is such that Fix often does things, which he later \nregrets. He stays with Aouda at the Station but keeps worrying whether Fogg shall \ncome back or not. Fix\u2019s anxiety is extreme and this makes the reader feel contemptuous \ntowards him. Aouda on the other hand is worried for Fogg\u2019s sake. She has begun \nto love him dearly and she wonders what she will do if something drastic were \nto happen to him. The night of waiting at the station is a very painfully long \none for her.<PARAGRAPH>The engine driver and the stoker return in the engine that \nhad separated from the train. While all the passengers are very happy, it is decided \nthat the train shall now move immediately as it is already running late. Aouda \nand Fix request the engine driver to wait but he refuses. So Aouda and Fix are \nonce again left alone to await the arrival of Fogg. We see how Aouda matches Fogg\u2019s \ncalm with her own controlled demeanor. She is extremely worried, yet elegantly \nrestrained.<PARAGRAPH>As dawn approaches the Captain of the Station starts worrying \nand contemplates sending some soldiers after Fogg\u2019s group. But they are all glad \nto see Fogg\u2019s group return along with the three passengers that had been captured \nby the Sioux. Fogg is victorious yet again and with him is a smiling Passepartout. \nWe can see with every passing scene that Fogg is projected as the out and out \nhero of the narrative. He seldom fails. One of the factors for his success is \nthe fact that he understands that humans always work harder when given incentive. \nWhenever he is faced with the challenge of limited time or a difficult situation, \nhe offers reward money to the people who are a part of the situation and that \ndoes wonders for him. In the case of the Fort Kearney soldiers, he offers them \nreward money if they are able to rescue the passengers and fight the Sioux. When \nthe feat is accomplished Fogg does not forget to distribute the money equitably. \nWhen they reach the Station, Passepartout's only concern is that they board the \ntrain as fast as possible and move on with their journey. He is angry when he \nlearns that the train has already left whereas Fogg is as calm as ever. It is \nthis calmness that makes him a winner and a formidable force.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days29.html"}
