{"name": "chapter 2", "summary": "During his brief interview with Mr. Fogg, Passepartout had been carefully observing \nhim. He appeared to be a man about forty years of age, with fine, handsome features, \nand a tall, well shaped figure. His countenance possessed in the highest degree \n\"repose in action,\" a quality of those who act rather than talk. Seen \nin the various phases of his daily life, he gave the idea of being perfectly well \nbalanced. Phileas Fogg\u2019s immaculate appearance and efficient behavior is now described.<PARAGRAPH>As for Passepartout, he was a true Parisian of Paris. Since he had abandoned \nhis own country for England, taking service as a valet, he had in vain searched \nfor a master after his own heart. He was unlike other servants and had a certain \nclass despite his colorful past. The author continues with his third person narrative \n- \" It would be rash to predict how Passepartout\u2019s lively nature would agree \nwith Mr. Fogg. It was impossible to tell whether the new servant would turn out \nas absolutely methodical as his master required; experience alone could solve \nthe question.\" Passepartout himself is described as a man who had been a \nsort of vagrant in his early years, and who now yearned for repose. Passepartout \nwas desirous of respecting the gentleman whom he served. Hearing that Mr. Phileas \nFogg was looking for a servant, and that his life was one of unbroken regularity, \nhe felt sure that this would be the place he was after.<PARAGRAPH>When Passepartout \nfound himself alone in the house in Saville Row, he inspected it, and found the \nneatness quite to his liking. He observed, hung over the clock, a card which, \nupon inspection, proved to be a program of the daily routine of the house. It \ncomprised all that was required of the servant, from morning till night. In short, \nthe house, which must have been a very temple of disorder and unrest under the \nillustrious but dissipated Sheridan, was comfort, and method idealized. Passepartout \nis very pleased with the state of things and looks forward to his service with \nhis master, Mr. Fogg.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nThe second chapter concentrates \non Passerpartout and his reactions to the new home that he has taken service in. \nPassepartout is happy that Mr. Fogg is even more stiff than the wax figures of \nMadame Tussaud\u2019s at London. Calm and phlegmatic, with a clear eye, Mr. Fogg seemed \na perfect type of that English composure. The description of Mr. Fogg that had \nstarted in the first chapter continues here too - \" He was so exact that \nhe was never in a hurry, was always ready, and was economical alike of his steps \nand his motions. He never took one step too many, and always went to his destination \nby the shortest cut; he made no superfluous gestures, and was never seen to be \nmoved or agitated. He was the most deliberate person in the world, yet always \nreached his destination at the exact moment. He lived alone, and, so to speak, \noutside of every social relation; and as he knew that in this world account must \nbe taken of friction, and that friction retards, he never rubbed against anybody.\"<PARAGRAPH>If the master is \npraised profusely by his creator - Jules Verne, so is the master\u2019s servant - Passerpartout. \nThe author writes, - \" Passepartout was by no means one of those pert dunces \ndepicted by Moliere with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an \nhonest fellow, with a pleasant face, lips a trifle protruding, soft mannered and \nserviceable, with a good round head, such as one likes to see on the shoulders \nof a friend. His eyes were blue, his complexion rubicund, his figure almost portly \nand well built, his body muscular, and his physical powers fully developed by \nthe exercises of his younger days. His brown hair was somewhat tumbled.\"<PARAGRAPH>Passerpartout is made out to be as superior amongst his own class, as \nhis master is in his respective class. The two seem to fit each other perfectly. \nPasserpartout\u2019s history is outlined and it is emphasized that he could not take \nroot in coarse soil and was only suited to a lofty master, such as Mr. Fogg. As \nJules Verne writes about Passerpartout -<PARAGRAPH>\" But he could not take \nroot in any of these; with chagrin, he found his masters invariably whimsical \nand irregular, constantly running about the country, or on the look out for adventure.\" \nIt is ironic to note here that while Passerpartout joins Mr. Fogg to escape a \nwhirlwind lifestyle, he gets exactly that which he had tried to flee from. When \nMr. Fogg undertakes his journey around the world, Passerpartout is dragged along \nas well.<PARAGRAPH>While Passepartout is exploring the house, he reaches the second \nstory and recognizes at once the room, which he was to inhabit, and he was well \nsatisfied with it. The description of Mr. Fogg\u2019s house\u2019s details has us surprised \nand questioning - \" Electric bells and speaking tubes afforded communication \nwith the lower stories; while on the mantel stood an electric clock, precisely \nlike that in Mr. Fogg\u2019s bedchamber, both beating the same second at the same instant.\" \n\"That\u2019s good, that\u2019ll do,\" said Passepartout to himself.<PARAGRAPH>We \nlearn that Mr. Fogg follows a well-planned regimen at all times and it is imperative \nthat the routine be followed strictly. Even Mr. Fogg\u2019s wardrobe is described - \nIt was amply supplied and in the best taste. Each pair of trousers, coat, and \nvest bore a number, indicating the time of year and season at which they were \nin turn to be laid out for wearing; and the same system was applied to the master\u2019s \nshoes.<PARAGRAPH>Having scrutinized the house from top to bottom, Passerpartout \nrubbed his hands, a broad smile overspread his features and he said joyfully, \n\"This is just what I wanted! Ah, we shall get on together, Mr. Fogg and I! \nWhat a domestic and regular gentleman! A real machine; well, I don\u2019t mind serving \na machine.\" The second chapter is devoted to Passerpartout and not without \nreason. He is to be in Mr. Fogg\u2019s company and it is because of his carelessness \nat more than one occasion, that Mr. Fogg gets into trouble and obstacles in his \nhurried trip round the world. By the end of the second chapter, the reader understands \nthe characters of both the master and the servant. Now, the reader waits to see \nthe nature of the adventures that the two shall have together.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days07.html"}
