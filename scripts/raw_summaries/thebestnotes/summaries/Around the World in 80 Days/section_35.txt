{"name": "chapter 31", "summary": "Phileas Fogg was now twenty hours behind time and \nPassepartout was desperate. Fix then comes to Fogg with the suggestion that they \ntravel to Omaha on a sledge with sails. Fogg meets the American named Mudge, who \nhad suggested this innovation. Fogg inspects the somewhat strange vehicle and \nagrees to travel in this sledge. Aouda is asked to stay with Passepartout but \nshe refuses and wants to travel along with Fogg. Thus the entire group-Fogg, Passepartout, \nAouda and of course the Captain of the sledge-Mudge, travel together to Omaha \nstation. They manage to traverse the two hundred miles in the extreme cold and \nreach Omaha. Fogg pays Mudge liberally. They take a train from Omaha to Chicago \nand another from Chicago to New York. But on reaching New York they find out that \nthe ship bound for Liverpool has already left.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nIn this chapter, Fix the supposed adversary actually helps Fogg. At the starting \nof the chapter, Fogg is running extremely late and has no means of moving from \nOmaha station. It is then that Fix comes up with a suggestion that they travel \non a sledge to Omaha Station. An American had previously approached Fix with the \nidea of travelling on a sledge with sails. Fix introduces this American named \nMudge to Fogg and Fogg inspects the vehicle before deciding whether he would be \nable to travel on it. We can see that this is one man, who will not take decisions \nhastily. There will always be an adequate thought process and sensible decision-making \ninvolved.<PARAGRAPH>It is these qualities, which make him the undoubted hero of \nthis novel. Fogg comes to terms with the skipper of the land craft and agrees \nto use this unique method of travel. Being the gentleman that he is he does not \nwish to expose Aouda to the harsh weather and asks her to stay back at the station \nwith Passepartout. But she refuses and insists on traveling with him.<PARAGRAPH>We can see that this pair is \u2018meant to be\u2019 and that their feelings for each other \nare growing every day.<PARAGRAPH>Verne needs to be complimented once again for his unflagging pace in the narrative. \nIn the previous chapter, travelers were being rescued from the Sioux and in this \none the voyagers travel in a strange craft-a sledge with sails!<PARAGRAPH>The journey \non a sledge is unique and a \u2018speechless\u2019 one. The passengers feel too cold to \nbe able to talk. Fogg makes only one comment, an interesting one at that. We see \nthat he has knowledge of music too. They reach Omaha Station and from here, travel \nis no problem. The station is well connected to Chicago, which in turn is well \nconnected to New York.<PARAGRAPH>Verne makes his narrative interesting by varying \nthe pace at different occasions. The journey from Omaha to New York is completed \nin a few paragraphs. A disappointment awaits Fogg at New York-the ship that he \nwas to board for Liverpool-has already left.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days30.html"}
