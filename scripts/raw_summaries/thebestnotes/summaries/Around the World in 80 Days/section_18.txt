{"name": "chapter 14", "summary": "The rash exploit had been accomplished; and for an \nhour Passepartout laughed gaily at his success. Sir Francis pressed the worthy \nfellow\u2019s hand, and Fogg said, \"Well done!\" which, from him, was high \ncommendation; to which Passepartout replied that all the credit of the affair \nbelonged to Mr. Fogg. Meanwhile, the lady reposed in a howdah on the elephant. \nThe elephant was advancing rapidly through the still dark forest, and, an hour \nafter leaving the pagoda had crossed a vast plain. Sir Francis was not worried \nabout the effects of intoxication on Aouda, which he knew would subsequently subside \nbut he was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate. He told Phileas \nFogg that, should Aouda remain in India, she would inevitably fall again into \nthe hands of her executioners and that it would be better to get her out of the \ncountry. Phileas Fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matter. The station \nat Allahabad was reached about ten o\u2019clock, and, the interrupted line of railway \nbeing resumed, would enable them to reach Calcutta in less than twenty-four hours.<PARAGRAPH>While the young woman waited at the station, Passepartout was charged \nwith purchasing for her various articles of toilet, for which his master gave \nhim unlimited credit. Passepartout made it a point, as he made his purchases, \nto take a good look at the city. The sacred city of Allahabad is described. By \nthe time Passepartout returns to Aouda, the influence to which the priests of \nPillaji had subjected Aouda began gradually to yield, and she became more herself, \nso that her fine eyes resumed all their soft Indian expression. It is enough to \nsay, without applying poetical rhapsody to Aouda, that she was a charming woman, \nin all the European acceptation of the phrase. She spoke English with great purity, \nand the guide had not exaggerated in saying that the young Parsee had been transformed \nby her bringing up.<PARAGRAPH>The train was about to start from Allahabad, and Mr. \nFogg proceeded to pay the guide, the price agreed upon for his service. The guide \nhad, indeed, risked his life in the adventure at Pillaji, and, if the Indians \nshould catch him afterwards, he would with difficulty escape their vengeance. \nPhileas Fogg had already determined the answer to the question of how to dispose \noff Kiouni, the elephant. He asks the Parsee whether he would like to keep the \nelephant. Passepartout encourages the giving of the elephant to the worthy guide, \nwho is very happy. Soon after, Phileas Fogg, Sir Francis Cromarty, and Passepartout, \ninstalled in a carriage with Aouda, who had the best seat, were whirling at full \nspeed towards Benares. During the journey, the young woman fully recovered her \nsenses. Her companions revived her with a little liquor, and then Sir Francis \nnarrated to her what had passed, dwelling upon the courage with which Phileas \nFogg had not hesitated to risk his life to save her, and recounting the happy \nsequel of the venture, the result of Passepartout\u2019s rash idea. Aouda pathetically \nthanked her deliverers, her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her \nlips. Fogg reassures her fears of the natives by offering to take her to Hong \nKong where she has a relative too.<PARAGRAPH>At Benares, Sir Francis gets off after \nbidding a warm farewell to his companions.<PARAGRAPH>The areas that they are passing \nthrough are described beautifully by the author. The panorama passed before their \neyes like a flash, save when the steam concealed it fitfully from the view. Calcutta \nwas reached at seven in the morning, and they left for Hong Kong at noon; so that \nPhileas Fogg had five hours before him. According to his journal, he was due at \nCalcutta on the 25 th of October, and that was the exact date of his actual arrival. \nHe was therefore neither behind-hand nor ahead of time. The two days gained between \nLondon and Bombay had been lost in the journey across India. But it is not to \nbe supposed that Phileas Fogg regretted them.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nThe group looks back at their successful adventure \nwith delight. As for Passepartout, he gives all the credit to his master, he had \nonly been struck with a \"queer\" idea; and he laughed to think that for \na few moments he, Passepartout, the ex-gymnast, ex-sergeant fireman, had been \nthe spouse of a charming woman, a venerable, embalmed rajah! As for the young \nIndian woman, she had been unconscious throughout of what was passing, and now, \nwrapped up in a travelling-blanket, was reposing in one of the howdahs.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout is not only brave and comic, but also large hearted. He is extremely \nlikeable in his magnanimity, and he does not blow his own trumpet. Though the \nrescue is a success because of him, he gives the credit to Fogg for having urged \nthe group to stay near the pagoda till the suttee ritual.<PARAGRAPH>They make a \nhalt at seven o\u2019clock, the young woman being still in a state of complete prostration. \nThe guide made her drink a little brandy and water, but the drowsiness that stupefied \nher could not yet be shaken off. Sir Francis, who was familiar with the effects \nof the intoxication produced by the fumes of hemp, reassured his companions on \nher account. It is he who points out reality to Fogg and explains how the lady\u2019s \nlife would still be in danger, while she was in India. These fanatics were scattered \nthroughout the country, and would, despite the English police, recover their victim \nat Madras, Bombay, or Calcutta. She would only be safe by quitting India forever. \nFogg tells Sir Francis that he shall work out what needs to be done.<PARAGRAPH>The \ngroup reaches Allahabad on the elephant. Passepartout is immediately told by Fogg \nto get some necessities for the lady. We can see that Fogg, Passepartout as well \nas Sir Francis take care of the lady and are most gentlemen-like. This is a characteristic \nof most English. Passepartout is fond of seeing different cities. When he starts \noff on his errand, and finds himself on the streets of Allahabad, that is, the \nCity of God, he is delighted. Allahabad is one of the most venerated cities in \nIndia, being built at the junction of the two sacred rivers, Ganges and Jumna, \nthe waters of which attract pilgrims from every part of the peninsula. The Ganges, \naccording to the legends of the Ramayana, rises in heaven, whence, owing to Brahma\u2019s \nagency; it descends to the earth. Verne\u2019s description of India is full of little \nnuances on the country that he must have been able to impart only after in depth \nstudy and research.<PARAGRAPH>Verne writes more about Allahabad - \" It was \nformerly defended by a noble fort, which has since become a state prison; its \ncommerce has dwindled away, and Passepartout in vain looked about him for a bazaar \nas he used to frequent in Regent Street. At last he came upon an elderly, crusty \nJew, who sold second-hand articles, and from whom he purchased a dress of Scotch \nstuff, a large mantle, and a fine otter-skin pelisse, for which he did not hesitate \nto pay seventy-five pounds. He then returned triumphantly to the station.\"<PARAGRAPH>Aouda is painted as the archetypal beautiful and exotic Indian princess. \nExotic Indian beauty is a common motif in novels on India by British authors and \nwe see that this is true of Verne too in his little portrait of the Eastern country. \nVerne writes - \" When the poet-king, Usaf Uddaul, celebrates the charms of \nthe queen of Ahmehnagara, he speaks thus: \"Her shining tresses, divided in \ntwo parts, encircle the harmonious contour of her white and delicate cheeks, brilliant \nin their glow and freshness. Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow \nof Kama, the god of love, and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections \nand a celestial light swim, as in the sacred lakes of Himalaya, in the black pupils \nof her great clear eyes. Her teeth, fine, equal, and white, glitter between her \nsmiling lips like dewdrops in a passionflower\u2019s half-enveloped breast. Her delicately \nformed ears, her vermilion hands, her little feet, curved and tender as the lotus-bud, \nglitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of Ceylon, the most dazzling \ndiamonds of Golconda. Her narrow and supple waist, which a hand may clasp around, \nsets forth the outline of her rounded figure and the beauty of her bosom, where \nyouth in its flower displays the wealth of its treasures; and beneath the silken \nfolds of her tunic she seems to have been modeled in pure silver by the godlike \nhand of Vicvarcarma, the immortal sculptor.\"\" Verne goes on to say that \none does not require such a description of Aouda to describe her, but it is suffice \nto say that she is very charming.<PARAGRAPH>When Fogg pays the guide the promised \nmoney and not a farthing more; Passepartout is astonished, who remembered all \nthat his master owed to the guide\u2019s devotion. We can see that Passepartout is \na man with a sense of fairness and that he expects a great deal of magnanimity \nfrom his master to others too. But, he is not disappointed. Fogg says - \"Parsee, \nyou have been serviceable and devoted. I have paid for your service, but not for \nyour devotion. Would you like to have this elephant? He is yours.\" The guide\u2019s \neyes glistened. \"Your honor is giving me a fortune!\" cried he. \"Take \nhim, guide,\" returned Mr. Fogg, \"and I shall still be your debtor.\" \n\"Good!\" exclaimed Passepartout. \"Take him, friend. Kiouni is a \nbrave and faithful beast.\" And, going up to the elephant, he gave him several \nlumps of sugar, saying, \"Here, Kiouni, here, here.\" The elephant grunted \nout his satisfaction, and, clasping Passepartout around the waist with his trunk, \nlifted him as high as his head. Passepartout, not in the least alarmed, caressed \nthe animal, which replaced him gently on the ground.<PARAGRAPH>Aouda finally wakes \nup in the train. What was her astonishment to find herself in this carriage, on \nthe railway, dressed in European habiliments, and with travelers who were quite \nstrangers to her! Sir Francis relates the tale of her rescue to her. Mr. Fogg \nsaid nothing; while Passepartout, abashed, kept repeating that \"it wasn\u2019t \nworth telling.\" Then, as her thoughts strayed back to the scene of the sacrifice, \nand recalled the dangers that still menaced her, she shuddered with terror. Phileas \nFogg understood what was passing in Aouda\u2019s mind, and offered, in order to reassure \nher, to escort her to Hong Kong, where she might remain safely until the affair \nwas hushed up--an offer which she eagerly and gratefully accepted. She had, it \nseems, a Parsee relation, who was one of the principal merchants of Hong Kong, \nwhich is wholly an English city, though on an island on the Chinese coast. Fogg \nis a compassionate man and is ready to help the needy, as he agrees to help the \nbeautiful Aouda now.<PARAGRAPH>At half-past twelve the train stopped at Benares. \nOnce again, Verne takes up the task of describing the city. He writes - \" \nThe Brahmin legends assert that this city is built on the site of the ancient \nCasi, which, like Mahomet\u2019s tomb, was once suspended between heaven and earth; \nthough the Benares of to-day, which the Orientalists call the Athens of India, \nstands quite un-poetically on the solid earth, Passepartout caught glimpses of \nits brick houses and clay huts, giving an aspect of desolation to the place, as \nthe train entered it.\" Benares was Sir Francis Cromarty\u2019s destination, the \ntroops he was rejoining being encamped some miles northward of the city. He bade \nadieu to Phileas Fogg, wishing him all success, and expressing the hope that he \nwould come that way again in a less original but more profitable fashion. Mr. \nFogg lightly pressed him by the hand. The parting of Aouda, who did not forget \nwhat she owed to Sir Francis, betrayed more warmth; and, as for Passepartout, \nhe received a hearty shake of the hand from the gallant general. Women are generally \nmore emotionally demonstrative than men.<PARAGRAPH>The railway, on leaving Benares, \npassed for a while along the valley of the Ganges. Through the windows of their \ncarriage, the travelers had glimpses of the diversified landscape of Behar, with \nits mountains clothed in verdure, its fields of barley, wheat, and corn, its jungles \npeopled with green alligators, its neat villages, and its still thickly-leaved \nforests. Elephants were bathing in the waters of the sacred river, and groups \nof Indians, despite the advanced season and chilly air, were performing solemnly \ntheir pious ablutions. These were fervent Brahmins, the bitterest foes of Buddhism, \ntheir deities being Vishnu, the solar god, Shiva, the divine impersonation of \nnatural forces, and Brahma, the supreme ruler of priests and legislators. What \nwould these divinities think of India, anglicised as it is to-day, with steamers \nwhistling and scudding along the Ganges, frightening the gulls which float upon \nits surface, the turtles swarming along its banks, and the faithful dwelling upon \nits borders. The travelers could scarcely discern the fort of Chupenie, twenty \nmiles south-westward from Benares, the ancient stronghold of the rajahs of Behar; \nor Ghazipur and its famous rose-water factories; or the tomb of Lord Cornwallis, \nrising on the left bank of the Ganges; the fortified town of Buxar, or Patna, \na large manufacturing and trading-place, where is held the principal opium market \nof India; or Monghir, a more than European town, for it is as English as Manchester \nor Birmingham, with its iron foundries, edgetool factories, and high chimneys \npuffing clouds of black smoke heavenward.<PARAGRAPH>Night came on; the train passed \non at full speed, in the midst of the roaring of the tigers, bears, and wolves, \nwhich fled before the locomotive; and the marvels of Bengal, Golconda ruined Gour, \nMurshedabad, the ancient capital, Burdwan, Hugly, and the French town of Chandernagor, \nwhere Passepartout would have been proud to see his country\u2019s flag flying, were \nhidden from their view in the darkness. They reach Calcutta the next morning. \nTill now, Fogg is right on time, he is neither late nor early. He plans now to \ntake the ship to Hong Kong.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days19.html"}
