{"name": "chapter 9", "summary": "The distance between Suez and Aden is thirteen hundred and ten miles, \nand the regulations of the company allow the steamers, one hundred and thirty-eight \nhours in which to traverse it. The Mongolia seemed likely, to reach her destination \nconsiderably within that time. Verne describes the nature of the passengers on \nboard who were mostly bound for India - either Bombay or Calcutta. What with the \nmilitary men, a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels, and the hospitable \nefforts of the purser, the time passed quickly on the Mongolia.<PARAGRAPH>The journey \non the Mongolia is described. There are a lot of parties on board, which only \ncease when there are minor storms on the Red Sea. Phileas Fogg in the meantime \nwas least bothered about the course of the ship and never really went up to the \ndeck to see the various sights of the Red Sea. He passed his time by having four \nhearty meals every day, regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching \non the part of the steamer; and he played whist indefatigably, for he had found \npartners as enthusiastic in the game as himself.<PARAGRAPH>As for Passepartout, \nhe, too, had escaped seasickness, and took his meals conscientiously in the forward \ncabin. He rather enjoyed the voyage, for he was well fed and well lodged, took \na great interest in the scenes through which they were passing, and consoled himself \nwith the delusion that his master\u2019s whim would end at Bombay. He was pleased, \non the day after leaving Suez, to find on deck the obliging person (Fix) with \nwhom he had walked and chatted on the quays. Fix tells Passepartout that he is \nan agent for the Provinces and that he has made the journey to Bombay often. He \ncasually asks how Fogg is and learns that Passepartout hopes that this mad trip \naround the world will end at Bombay.<PARAGRAPH>After this meeting, Passepartout \nand Fix got into the habit of chatting together, the latter making it a point \nto gain the worthy man\u2019s confidence. He frequently offered him a glass of whiskey \nor pale ale in the steamer bar room, which Passepartout never failed to accept \nwith graceful alacrity, mentally pronouncing Fix, the best of good fellows.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, the Mongolia was pushing forward rapidly. The Mongolia had still sixteen \nhundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching Bombay, and was obliged to \nremain four hours at Steamer Point to coal up. But this delay, as it was foreseen, \ndid not affect Phileas Fogg\u2019s program; besides, the Mongolia, instead of reaching \nAden on the morning of the 15 th , when she was due, arrived there \non the evening of the 14 th , a gain of fifteen hours.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. \nFogg and his servant went ashore at Aden to have the passport validated again; \nFix, followed them. The visa procured, Mr. Fogg returned on board to resume his \nformer habits; while Passepartout, according to custom, sauntered about among \nthe mixed population of Somalis, Banyans, Parsees, Jews, Arabs, and Europeans \nwho comprised the twenty-five thousand inhabitants of Aden. At six p.m. the Mongolia \nslowly moved out of the roadstead, and was soon once more on the Indian Ocean. \nThe steamer rolled but little, the ladies, in fresh toilets, reappeared on deck, \nand the singing and dancing were resumed. The trip was being accomplished most \nsuccessfully, and Passepartout was enchanted with the congenial companion, which \nchance had secured him in the person of the delightful Fix.<PARAGRAPH>On October 20 th , they came in sight of the Indian \ncoast. A range of hills lay against the sky in the horizon, and soon the rows \nof palms, which adorn Bombay, came distinctly into view. The steamer hauled up \nat the quays of Bombay. Fogg was in the act of finishing the thirty third rubber \nof the voyage, and his partner and himself having, by a bold stroke, captured \nall thirteen of the tricks, concluded this fine campaign with a brilliant victory.<PARAGRAPH>The Mongolia was due at Bombay on the 22 nd ; she arrived on \nthe 20 th . This was a gain to Phileas Fogg of two days since his departure \nfrom London, and he calmly entered the fact in the itinerary, in the column of \ngains.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nJules Verne gives here a description \nof the ship\u2019s journey and the people who were aboard. The greater part of the \npassengers from Brindisi were bound for India, some for Bombay, others for Calcutta \nby way of Bombay, the nearest route thither, now that a railway crosses the Indian \npeninsula. Verne\u2019s knowledge of India too is diverse and is on display here. He \nwrites - \"Among the passengers were a number of officials and military officers \nof various grades, the latter being either attached to the regular British forces \nor commanding the Sepoy troops, and receiving high salaries ever since the central \ngovernment has assumed the powers of the East India Company: for the sub-lieutenants \nget 280 pounds, brigadiers, 2,400 pounds, and generals of divisions, 4,000 pounds.\"<PARAGRAPH>The journey on the Mongolia was quite enjoyable. The best of fare was \nspread upon the cabin tables at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the eight o\u2019clock \nsupper, and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day; and the \nhours were whirled away, when the sea was tranquil, with music, dancing, and games.<PARAGRAPH>But the Red Sea is full of caprice, and often boisterous, like most long \nand narrow gulfs. When the wind came from the African or Asian coasts the Mongolia, \nwith her long hull, rolled fearfully. Then the ladies speedily disappeared below; \nthe pianos were silent; singing and dancing suddenly ceased. Yet the good ship \ncontinued straight on, unrestrained by wind or wave, towards the straits of Babel-Mandeb.<PARAGRAPH>Verne adds a casual touch by actually asking the reader what we presume \nMr. Fogg was doing all this time? The author adds that it might be thought that, \nin his anxiety, he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind, the disorderly \nraging of the billows--every chance, in short, which might force the Mongolia \nto slacken her speed, and thus interrupt his journey. But, if Fogg did think of \nthese possibilities, he did not betray the fact by any outward sign.<PARAGRAPH>Always \nthe same impassible member of the Reform Club, whom no incident could ruffle, \nas unvarying as the ship\u2019s chronometers, and seldom having the curiosity even \nto go upon the deck, he passed through the memorable scenes of the Red Sea with \ncold indifference. He did not care to recognize the historic towns and villages, \nwhich along its borders raised their picturesque outlines against the sky. He \nbetrayed no fear of the dangers of the Arabic Gulf, which the old historians always \nspoke of with horror, and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without \npropitiating the gods by ample sacrifices.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg passed the time by playing \nwhist. He played with a few companions who were as enthusiastic about the game \nof whist as he was himself - a tax collector, on the way to his post at Goa; the \nRev. Decimus Smith, returning to his parish at Bombay; and a brigadier general \nof the English army, who was about to rejoin his brigade at Benares. They played \nwhist by the hour together in absorbing silence.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout meets Fix \non the Mongolia. He is pleasantly surprised at finding the gentleman who guided \nhim at the Suez on board. Passepartout when he learns that Fix too is bound for \nBombay, he questions him about India. Fix answers him with caution so as not to \ngive his game away. Fix hints that perhaps Fogg\u2019s tour may conceal some secret \nerrand or a diplomatic mission. To this Passepartout replies, \"Faith, Monsieur \nFix, I assure you I know nothing about it, nor would I give half a crown to find \nout.\" After this conversation, Passepartout and Fix meet for many more such \nconversations. Fix humors the simple servant by treating him to drinks often. \nPassepartout never suspects that Fix is doing all this for a selfish reason and \nnot for the sake of mere companionship.<PARAGRAPH>On the 13th, Mocha, surrounded \nby its ruined walls whereon date trees were growing, was sighted, and on the mountains \nbeyond were espied vast coffee fields. Passepartout was ravished to behold this \ncelebrated place, and thought that, with its circular walls and dismantled fort, \nit looked like an immense coffee cup and saucer. The following night they passed \nthrough the Strait of Babel Mandeb, which means in Arabic \u2018 The Bridge of Tears\u2019, \nand the next day they put in at Steamer Point, northwest of Aden harbor, to take \nin coal. This matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances from \nthe coalmines; it costs the Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds \na year. In these distant seas, coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton. \nThus, Verne is able to provide realistic pictures of the journey that the ship \ntranscribes.<PARAGRAPH>Unlike Fogg, Passepartout takes keen interest in the scenes \naround him. He is a Frenchman with a taste for adventure. He gazed with wonder \nupon the fortifications of Aden, which make this place the Gibraltar of the Indian \nOcean, and the vast cisterns where the English engineers were still at work, two \nthousand years after the engineers of Solomon.<PARAGRAPH>\"Very curious, very \ncurious,\" said Passepartout to himself, on returning to the steamer. \"I \nsee that it is by no means useless to travel, if a man wants to see something \nnew.\"<PARAGRAPH>After the ship leaves Aden, the sea was favorable, the wind \nbeing in the northwest, and all sails aided the engine. The steamer manages to \nmake it earlier to Bombay than expected. So far, Fogg seems to be on a winning \nspree. Not only does the ship reach two days earlier, Fogg also does well in the \ngame of whist and wins a great deal of money. He seems to prove right the maxim \nthat calmness and stability of mind lead to success. Fogg is undoubtedly the hero \nof the novel, but the question is that how long will his luck last.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days14.html"}
