{"name": "jules verne - biography", "summary": "Jules Verne' whole life was spent either \nwriting or preparing for it. Jules Gabriel Verne was born in Nantes, France in \n1828. Born as the second child of four, in a middle class Nantes family, his schooldays \nwere reasonably successful without being brilliant. Jules\u2019 parents belonged to \nthe seafaring tradition, a factor that greatly influenced his writings. When very \nyoung, he ran off to be a cabin boy on a merchant ship, but was caught and had \nto return to his parents. Verne went to school from 1834 - 1838, where his teacher \nwas the widow of a sea captain, and she kept waiting for her husband\u2019s return. \nHe was in college from 1838 - 1842 where he performed well in geography, singing \nand in translations from Greek and Latin.<PARAGRAPH>Between 1841 - 1846, Verne started \nwriting short prose pieces. In 1847, Jules was sent to study law in Paris. His \ncousin, Caroline Tronson with whom he had been unhappily in love for several years, \ngot engaged. His passion for theatre grew, while he was there. He wrote a play \ncalled Alexandre VI. In 1848, there was a revolution in Paris and Verne \nwas present in the July disturbances. His uncle introduced him into literary salons \nwhere he met novelists such as Dumas. Later in 1850, this budding author\u2019s first \nplay was published. His father was outraged when he heard that Jules was not going \nto continue law and discontinued the money he was giving him to pay for his expenses \nin Paris.<PARAGRAPH>In 1871 Jules\u2019s father died and between 1876-77 he bought \nhis second and third boats and even organized a huge fancy dress ball. His marriage \nwas not totally happy; and he seems to have had mistresses. His wife was critically \nill that year but recovered. In 1876, he bought a large yacht and sailed around \nEurope. In 1877, Verne sailed to Lisbon and Algiers. His son Michel married an \nactress in 1879, despite the opposition of his father. In 1883-84, Verne left \nwith his wife on a grand tour of the Mediterranean.<PARAGRAPH>In 1888 he was elected \nlocal councilor on a Republican list and for the next fifteen years, he attended \ncouncil meetings, administrated theatres and fairs and gave public talks. In 1895 \nhe wrote his first novel in a European language in the present tense and third \nperson. After 1897 his health deteriorated.<PARAGRAPH>n 1905 he fell seriously ill \nfrom diabetes and died in the city of Amines. On Verne\u2019s death, The Invasion \nof the Sea and The Lighthouse at the \nend of the World were in the course of publication. \nMichel, his son then took responsibility for the remaining manuscripts and published \nthem later. It was only in 1978 that it was discovered that the Jules Verne books \nthat appeared posthumously had a major part of their writing done by Michel. This \ncame as a surprise to many. The simplicity of Verne\u2019s life seems to be in opposition \nto the complexity of his works", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days05.html"}
