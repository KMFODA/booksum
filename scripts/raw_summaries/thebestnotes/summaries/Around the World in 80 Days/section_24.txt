{"name": "chapter 20", "summary": "After describing Passepartout's activities in Hong \nKong, in this chapter, the fate of Fogg and Aouda is delineated. As Aouda was \nto travel with Fogg to Europe, many purchases had to be made for her. Fogg accompanies \nher for shopping at Hong Kong and Aouda is grateful. Then they retire comfortably \nto their hotel rooms and the next day they reach the dockyard in order to board \nthe Carnatic. But, to their disappointment they learn that the ship has already \nleft. Fix meets them and inquires about their servant as well as about the fact \nthat they have missed the ship. He is happy that Fogg is delayed but Fogg being \nthe determined man he is, he manages to find a ship called Tankadere that can \ntake them to Shanghai. The trustworthy John Bunsby pilots the ship and Fogg is \nkind enough to ask detective Fix to take a seat in this hired ship as well. Fix \nagrees and the group leaves Hong Kong on the ship, with the destination of Shanghai \nin mind.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nFogg is a true gentleman and looks \nafter the ladylike Aouda quite well. But, one cannot fathom whether he is in love \nwith her or is merely performing his duty. Even if he were in love with her, he \nwould not have expressed it so readily, is what we realize. Nevertheless, Fogg \nand Aouda together in Hong Kong make a charming pair. Aouda is presented as delicate \nand very lady like. Both Fogg and Aouda are oblivious of the fact that while they \nshop, eat and rest at Hong Kong, the ship Carnatic has already departed.<PARAGRAPH>The next morning when they go to the dockyard they find that it has left for Yokohama. \nEven Passepartout has disappeared. Fogg maintains his calm as always. It is in \nthis 20 th chapter, that Fix finally meets Fogg. He pretends that he \ntoo had planned to board the Carnatic and had missed the ship. Fix is so deceitful \nthat he does not mention Passepartout's intoxication to Fogg.<PARAGRAPH>We can see \nthat Aouda is genuinely concerned about Passepartout. Fogg too likes his valet \nthough he does not show it too obviously. He does his duty well though and makes \ngood arrangements for Passepartout at Hong Kong in case Passepartout goes to the \nConsulate or to the Police for help. Fogg is dependable and rational at all times.<PARAGRAPH>Fix is very happy that Fogg has missed the ship but his pleasure does \nnot last long. Fogg manages to find another way of reaching the next ship to New \nYork. He hires a ship to Shanghai. The captain of this ship-John Bunsby is a dependable \nand confident sailor. We indeed like this minor character. The Tankadere is described \nas a sturdy little ship. Aouda tells Fogg that she is not scared as long as she \nis with him. She is a brave young woman with style.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg is gentlemanly enough to ask Fix to join them. Fix of course is lowly enough \nto agree, even though his objective is only to spy on Fogg. Fix is truly a despicable \ncharacter. We have no respect for him. Now, we wait to see how far the Tankadere \ncan take Fogg and his fellow travelers.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days23.html"}
