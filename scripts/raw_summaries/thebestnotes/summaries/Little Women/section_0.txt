{"name": "chapter 1", "summary": "The March family consists of Marmee and her four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth \n        and Amy and Father who is off working as a chaplain in the Civil War. \n        We meet the girls first in Chapter 1 as they sit around the living room \n        bemoaning the fact that they will not be having Christmas presents this \n        year. They each have one dollar which seems too little to help any social \n        cause. The girls discuss what they are going to buy for themselves with \n        their money.<PARAGRAPH>The girls are in the process of warming their mother\u0092s ragged slippers \n        before the fire when Beth decides that she will use her dollar to get \n        her mother a pair of new ones. This brings animated discussion as each \n        girl thinks about what she might be able to buy her mother. They all agree \n        to go shopping the next day to buy gifts for Marmee.<PARAGRAPH>Planning and discussion takes place for other Christmas festivities. \n        The girls will be putting on a play, something which seems to be a family \n        tradition. At the end of the chapter, Marmee comes home bringing a letter \n        from Father who sends them news and his love, but reveals that he will \n        be away from home for at least another year.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide04.html"}
