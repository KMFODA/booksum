{"name": "chapter 7", "summary": "Meg performs a kindness for Amy by giving money she needs to participate \n        in a school fad, but the deed backfires, leaving Amy too humiliated to \n        return to the school.<PARAGRAPH>Pickled limes are the current fad. The girls treat each other to them \n        and trade off pencils and various trinkets for a lime to suck on. Amy\u0092s \n        predicament is that she has accepted limes from other girls but has not \n        had the means to pay them back. Meg gives her a quarter which is more \n        than enough to buy a dozen limes.<PARAGRAPH>Amy takes the limes to school and hides them in her desk, but can\u0092t \n        resist flaunting them a little before tucking them away until recess. \n        The word gets around and a certain Miss Snow who has treated Amy badly \n        suddenly becomes very polite in hopes of getting her share. When Amy tells \n        her that she won\u0092t get any, Miss Snow finds a way to report the limes \n        to the teacher, Mr. Davis, who has declared the limes a contraband article \n        and vowed to punish any girl caught with them. Amy is forced to take her \n        limes to the teacher\u0092s desk, then toss them out the window. After that, \n        Mr. Davis slaps her hand with his ruler, then makes her stand on a platform \n        until recess.<PARAGRAPH>Too humiliated to finish the day, Amy goes home and reports the incident \n        to her mother. Marmee is not entirely sympathetic with Amy as she believes \n        Amy should not have broken the rules. However, she does not agree with \n        Mr. Davis\u0092s method of correction either. Jo goes to the school to get \n        Amy\u0092s things and wipes the mud off her boots onto the floor mat before \n        leaving. Marmee agrees to let Amy have a temporary vacation from school \n        as long as she studies each day with Beth.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide07.html"}
