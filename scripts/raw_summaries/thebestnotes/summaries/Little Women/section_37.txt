{"name": "chapter 39", "summary": "Laurie spends a month instead of the planned week in France. He finds \n        himself drawn to Amy, but she is disgusted with him. She is too lady-like \n        and he too lazy for them to actually quarrel, but she accuses him of indolence \n        and of neglecting his own talent and potential. When she discovers that \n        the reason for his indifference is Jo\u2019s rejection, Amy is sympathetic \n        but still cannot accept the changes in him. Laurie tries to affect an \n        indifference to her scolding, but her words have a profound effect on \n        him.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide18.html"}
