{"name": "chapter 26", "summary": "Amy has been experimenting with one media after another in her artistic \n        creations. Although she is never satisfied with her own attempts, her \n        artistic endeavors have brought her into contact with many people. She \n        seems to come by social graces naturally and makes many friends. Amy\u2019s \n        greatest weakness is that \"she wants to move about in the best society \n        without knowing what the best really is.\"<PARAGRAPH>Amy\u2019s attempts to be a socialite lead to a minor disaster. She decides \n        to throw an expensive party for the girls in her drawing class. She buys \n        expensive food and plans to rent a fancy carriage to take them all riding. \n        The first day is somewhat rainy, so when no one shows, it is assumed that \n        everyone decided to wait for the next day as had previously been arranged \n        in case of inclement weather. But on the second day, only one girl comes. \n        Amy entertains Miss Elliot valiantly as her sisters quickly hide away \n        half of the prepared food. When it is over, Amy admits that it was a failure \n        and asks everyone to refrain from mentioning it for at least a month.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide13.html"}
