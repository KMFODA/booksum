{"name": "chapter 13", "summary": "Laurie spots the girls dressed as if to go walking or boating and thinks \n        they have failed to invite him. He follows them and finds them in a little \n        grove where each girl is engaged in her own particular hobby. Amy is drawing, \n        Beth sorting cones for crafts, Meg sewing and Jo knitting and reading \n        simultaneously.<PARAGRAPH>After allowing Laurie to join them, the girls explain that they are \n        still acting out Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, and that this little grove on the \n        hill is their version of \"The Delectable Mountain\" because they \n        can look far away and see the countryside where they hope to live some \n        day. This brings a discussion of castles and dreams. Laurie wants a place \n        to enjoy himself as a famous musician; Meg wants a house full of all sorts \n        of luxurious things; Jo wants a stable of Arabian steeds piled with books; \n        and Beth wants to stay at home with her parents and help care for the \n        family.<PARAGRAPH>Laurie declares that he has the key to his castle but isn\u2019t allowed \n        to use it because he has to go to college. Jo thoughtlessly advises him \n        to \"sail away\" in one of his own ships until he has accomplished \n        his dreams, but Meg chastises her, reminding Laurie of the kindnesses \n        he has received from his grandfather and Mr. Brooke.<PARAGRAPH>Later that evening Laurie sees his grandfather in a pensive mood and \n        resolves to give up his castle at least while the old man needs him.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide09.html"}
