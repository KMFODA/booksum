{"name": "chapter 28", "summary": "Meg learns to keep her own house and practices her cooking skills. In \n        a desire to faithfully meet her husband\u0092s needs, she tells him that he \n        can bring friends home to dinner anytime and needn\u0092t bother to ask her \n        first.<PARAGRAPH>Meg\u0092s good intention backfires when she decides to make currant jelly. \n        After an entire day of cooking and recooking and making a complete mess \n        of her kitchen, the jelly still won\u0092t gel, and Meg can\u0092t bring herself \n        to run to her mother for an answer to the problem.<PARAGRAPH>John brings his friend Mr Scott home, but Meg is neither prepared nor \n        willing to entertain company. When John makes a joke about the jelly, \n        it is the last straw for Meg. She shuts herself in her room leaving John \n        to entertain his friend. Later that evening they make up with Meg being \n        the first to apologize.<PARAGRAPH>Meg has access to her husband\u0092s income and keeps a little account book \n        which she voluntarily shows him every month. In the autumn of their first \n        year, however, Meg spends a lot of time with Sally Moffat. They shop together \n        and Meg, who loves pretty things, spends more money than she realizes. \n        The worse expenditure is $50.00 for some shimmering silk cloth to make \n        a new dress. Meg explains that she didn\u0092t mean to waste his money but \n        that she can\u0092t help wanting nice things when she sees all that Sally has. \n        Her words hurt John deeply; he doesn\u0092t scold or mention it again but he \n        works later at night and finally cancels an order for a new coat for himself \n        because he \"can\u0092t afford it.\" Overcome with guilt, Meg persuades \n        Sally to buy the silk; she then uses the money to buy the coat for John.<PARAGRAPH>At the end of the chapter, Meg\u0092s first children are born, a set of twins \n        who are named Margaret and John Laurence and given the nicknames Daisey \n        and Demi.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide14.html"}
