{"name": "chapter 45", "summary": "The twins are visiting their grandparents and Jo whom they call Aunt \n        Dodo. Daisy is a minature of Beth and Demi is an inquisitive and manipulative, \n        lovable rascal. For him, his dignified grandfather will lie on the floor \n        and twist his body to form the letters of the alphabet. Professor Bhaer \n        finds Mr. March in this humorous position when he comes to visit one day. \n        The children are aware of receiving less attention from Jo when \"the \n        bearman\" is around, but they settle for climbing on him and searching \n        his great-coat pockets for chocolates. On this particular day, Demi engages \n        the professor in a discussion about girls, confessing that he kissed a \n        little girl named \"Mary\" and she kissed him back. When Demi \n        asks if \"great boys like great girls\" too, the professor acts \n        embarrassed and gives an affirmative in a way that leaves no doubt about \n        his feelings for Jo.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide19.html"}
