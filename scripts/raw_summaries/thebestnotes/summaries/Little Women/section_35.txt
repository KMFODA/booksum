{"name": "chapter 37", "summary": "We find Amy and Laurie in France where he has promised to spend Christmas \n        with her. He seems glad to see her and admires the changes in her, but \n        the sentiment is not shared. To her, he seems indifferent, and his dandy-type \n        compliments are hollow and insincere. They attend a Christmas ball where \n        his off-hand remarks and relief at getting out of a dance offend her. \n        Amy deliberately ignores Laurie and dances with several others, spending \n        most of the evening with an 18 year old Polish count. Laurie observes \n        her in spite of himself, and when the count leaves, he spends the remainder \n        of the ball with her. The narrator drops a not-so-subtle hint that the \n        evening is the beginning of a relationship between the two.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide17.html"}
