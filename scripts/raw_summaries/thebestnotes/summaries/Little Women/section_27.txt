{"name": "chapter 29", "summary": "Amy has grown to be quite a lady with manners and bearing that suggest \n        a higher class upbringing than she has actually had. She likes to call \n        on various members of the community and has talked Jo into going with \n        her on this occasion. Amy gives Jo specific instructions on how to behave \n        at each home. Jo doesn\u0092t want to go in the first place, so she takes Amy\u0092s \n        instructions to extremes and exaggerates the behavior at each place. At \n        the first home, she is told to behave \"properly,\" so she sits \n        perfectly still, barely talks and is regarded by her hosts as \"haughty \n        and uninteresting.\" At the second, she is told to be sociable, so \n        she kisses all the girls, beams at the gentlemen and joins in a lively \n        chat about some of Amy\u0092s childhood episodes. At the Tudor home, Amy gives \n        up and tells Jo to do whatever she likes. Thus when the time comes to \n        leave, Jo is found sitting in the grass with a group of lively boys and \n        their dog.<PARAGRAPH>The visiting ends at Aunt March\u0092s house where Jo\u0092s abruptness will eventually \n        cost her. Aunt March and Aunt Carrol, who happens to be spending the day \n        with Aunt March, discuss an upcoming fair which is to be sponsored by \n        the wealthy Chesters. Jo scoffs at the fair, calling it a patronage and \n        ridiculing Amy for agreeing to be a part of it. Jo insists that she prefers \n        not to accept favors from people. A bit later the aunts get into a discussion \n        about speaking foreign languages; Amy says she speaks French fairly well, \n        but Jo scoffs at that idea also. When Aunt March\u0092s bird croaks a comment \n        about taking a walk, Jo uses it as an excuse to leave.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide14.html"}
