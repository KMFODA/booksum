{"name": "chapter 3", "summary": "Meg and Jo get their chance to meet the Laurence boy at a New Year\u0092s \n        Eve dance. The chapter begins with a great deal of discussion about costume \n        although the girls only have one outfit each. Jo\u0092s dress is burned in \n        the back because she has a habit of standing too close to the fire place \n        and her gloves are stained. She would go without gloves, but Meg won\u0092t \n        hear of it as she thinks it isn\u0092t proper to dance without gloves on. They \n        solve the problems by deciding that Jo won\u0092t dance at all but will simply \n        stand with her back to people so her dress won\u0092t show and that each of \n        them will wear a good glove and carry a stained one. After a variety of \n        minor mishaps, such as burning Meg\u0092s hair with the curling tongs, the \n        girls are ready to go. Jo, who often forgets herself and behaves like \n        a tomboy agrees to watch Meg for signs. Meg will raise her eyebrows if \n        Jo seems about to do anything foolish or improper.<PARAGRAPH>Meg is whisked away to dance nearly as soon as they arrive, but when \n        a red-headed boy looks as though he about to approach Jo, she slips into \n        a curtained recess. There she finds the Laurence boy who is hiding out \n        of shyness. They are soon chatting merrily as Laurie has all sorts of \n        stories about of his travels and education. Eventually he asks Jo to dance, \n        and she confesses that she can\u0092t because of the burned dress. Laurie solves \n        the problem by offering to dance in a long hallway connected to the ballroom.<PARAGRAPH>The evening is brought to an early end when Meg sprains her ankle; getting \n        her home is a problem at first, but Laurie overhears Jo asking someone \n        for a carriage and offers to have his grandfather take them home in his \n        carriage.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide05.html"}
