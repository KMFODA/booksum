{"name": "chapter 47", "summary": "Jo works and waits for a year while the professor fulfills his teaching \n        obligation. After they are married they take up residence at Plumfield, \n        the mansion willed to Jo by Aunt March. There Jo opens a school for boys.<PARAGRAPH>The Bhaer school at last gives the Laurences opportunity to spend their \n        wealth for a worthy cause. They have a knack for finding boys who need \n        the attention of the boys\u2019 home, and they always insist on paying \"a \n        trifle\" for the support of the ones they send. Within five years \n        of Jo\u2019s marriage, the Bhaer\u2019s have a lively home full of noisy boys, including \n        two of their own.<PARAGRAPH>Amy\u2019s one shadow is that her only child is a frail little girl whom \n        she fears losing, but Mrs. March encourages her to be hopeful. The story \n        ends with the family all together-minus Beth-but with the addition of \n        well-loved husbands and grandchildren.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide19.html"}
