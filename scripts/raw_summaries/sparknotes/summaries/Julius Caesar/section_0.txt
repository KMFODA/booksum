{"name": "Act I, scene i", "summary": "Act I, scene i Two tribunes, Flavius and Murellus, enter a Roman street, along with various commoners. Flavius and Murellus derisively order the commoners to return home and get back to work: \u201cWhat, know you not, / Being mechanical, you ought not walk / Upon a labouring day without the sign / Of your profession?\u201d (I.i.2\u20135). Murellus engages a cobbler in a lengthy inquiry about his profession; misinterpreting the cobbler\u2019s punning replies, Murellus quickly grows angry with him. Flavius interjects to ask why the cobbler is not in his shop working. The cobbler explains that he is taking a holiday from work in order to observe the triumph (a lavish parade celebrating military victory)\u2014he wants to watch Caesar\u2019s procession through the city, which will include the captives won in a recent battle against his archrival Pompey. Murellus scolds the cobbler and attempts to diminish the significance of Caesar\u2019s victory over Pompey and his consequent triumph. \u201cWhat conquest brings he home? / What tributaries follow him [Caesar] to Rome / To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?\u201d Murellus asks, suggesting that Caesar\u2019s victory does not merit a triumph since it involves no conquering of a foreign foe to the greater glory of Rome (I.i.31\u201333). Murellus reminds the commoners of the days when they used to gather to watch and cheer for Pompey\u2019s triumphant returns from battle. Now, however, due to a mere twist of fate, they rush out to celebrate his downfall. Murellus scolds them further for their disloyalty, ordering them to \u201cpray to the gods to intermit the plague / That needs must light on this ingratitude\u201d (I.i.53\u201354). The commoners leave, and Flavius instructs Murellus to go to the Capitol, a hill on which rests a temple on whose altars victorious generals offer sacrifice, and remove any crowns placed on statues of Caesar. Flavius adds that he will thin the crowds of commoners observing the triumph and directs Murellus to do likewise, for if they can regulate Caesar\u2019s popular support, they will be able to regulate his power (\u201cThese growing feathers plucked from Caesar\u2019s wing / Will make him fly an ordinary pitch\u201d [I.i.71\u201372]). Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act I, scene i\u00a0\u2192 Analysis Although the play opens with Flavius and Murellus noting the fickle nature of the public\u2019s devotion\u2014the crowd now celebrates Caesar\u2019s defeat of Pompey when once it celebrated Pompey\u2019s victories\u2014loyalty to Caesar nonetheless appears to be growing with exceptional force. Caesar\u2019s power and influence are likewise strong: Flavius and Murellus are later punished for removing the decorations from Caesar\u2019s statues. It is interesting to note the difference between the manner in which Flavius and Murellus conceive of the cobbler and that in which Shakespeare has created him. The cobbler is a typically Shakespearean character\u2014a host of puns and bawdy references reveal his dexterity with language (\u201call that I live by is with the awl. I meddle / with no tradesman\u2019s matters, nor women\u2019s matters\u201d [I.i.21\u201322]). The tribunes, however, preoccupied with class distinctions, view the cobbler as nothing more than a plebeian ruffian. Flavius\u2019s reproach of the cobbler for not having his tools about him on a workday reveals his belief that a laborer can be good for one thing and one thing only: laboring. Murellus similarly assumes the cobbler is stupid, although, ironically, it is Murellus himself who misunderstands the cobbler\u2019s answers to his questions. Murellus is unwilling to interpret the cobbler\u2019s shift in allegiance from Pompey to Caesar as anything but a manifestation of dim-witted forgetfulness. Flavius and Murellus\u2019s concern about Caesar\u2019s meteoric rise to power reflects English sentiment during the Elizabethan age about the consolidation of power in other parts of Europe. The strengthening of the absolutist monarchies in such sovereignties as France and Spain during the sixteenth century threatened the stability of the somewhat more balanced English political system, which, though it was hardly democratic in the modern sense of the word, at least provided nobles and elected representatives with some means of checking royal authority. Caesar\u2019s ascendance helped to effect Rome\u2019s transition from republic to empire, and Shakespeare\u2019s depiction of the prospect of Caesar\u2019s assumption of dictatorial power can be seen as a comment upon the gradual shift toward centralization of power that was taking place in Europe.<PARAGRAPH>In addition, Shakespeare\u2019s illustration of the fickleness of the Roman public proves particularly relevant to the English political scene of the time. Queen Elizabeth I was nearing the end of her life but had neither produced nor named an heir. Anxiety mounted concerning who her successor would be. People feared that without resort to the established, accepted means of transferring power\u2014passing it down the family line\u2014England might plunge into the sort of chaotic power struggle that had plagued it in the fifteenth century, during the Wars of the Roses. Flavius and Murellus\u2019s interest in controlling the populace lays the groundwork for Brutus\u2019s and Antony\u2019s manipulations of public opinion after Caesar\u2019s death. Shakespeare thus makes it clear that the struggle for power will involve a battle among the leaders to win public favor with displays of bravery and convincing rhetoric. Considering political history in the centuries after Shakespeare wrote Julius Caesar, especially in the twentieth century, when Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler consolidated their respective regimes by whipping up in the masses the overzealous nationalism that had pervaded nineteenth-century Italy and Germany, the play is remarkably prescient.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210120141529/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/juliuscaesar/section1/"}
