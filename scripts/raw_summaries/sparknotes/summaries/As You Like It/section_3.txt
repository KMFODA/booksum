{"name": "Act II, scenes v\u2013vii", "summary": "Act II, scene v  As Amiens strolls through the Forest of Ardenne with Jaques in tow, he sings a song inviting his listeners to lie with him \u201c[u]nder the greenwood tree\u201d (II.v.1), where there are no enemies but \u201cwinter and rough weather\u201d (II.v.8). Jaques begs him to continue, but Amiens hesitates, claiming that the song will only make Jaques melancholy. The warning does not deter Jaques, who proudly claims that he can \u201csuck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs\u201d (II.v.11\u201312). While the other lords in attendance prepare for Duke Senior\u2019s meal, Amiens leads them in finishing the song. Jaques follows with a verse set to the same tune, which he himself wrote. In it, he chides those foolish enough to leave their wealth and leisure for life in the forest. Amiens leaves to summon the duke to dinner.

When a lord reports that Jaques has last been seen in good spirits, the duke worries that happiness in one who is typically so miserable portends discord in the universe. Just after the duke commands the lord to find Jaques, Jaques appears. He is uncharacteristically merry and explains that while wandering through the forest, he met a fool. He repeats the fool\u2019s witty observations about Lady Fortune and proclaims that he himself would like to be a fool. In this position, Jaques reasons, he would be able to speak his mind freely, thereby cleansing \u201cthe foul body of th\u2019infected world\u201d with the \u201cmedicine\u201d of his criticism (II.vii.60\u201361). The duke laments the sin of \u201cchiding sin\u201d and reminds Jaques that he himself is guilty of many of the evils he would inevitably criticize in others (II.v.64). Their playful argument is interrupted when Orlando barges onto the scene, drawing his sword and demanding food. The duke asks whether Orlando\u2019s rudeness is a function of distress or bad breeding and, once Orlando has regained his composure, invites him to partake of the banquet. Orlando goes off to fetch Adam. Duke Senior observes that he and his men are far from alone in their unhappiness: there is much strife in the world. Jaques replies that the world is a stage and \u201call the men and women merely players\u201d (II.vii.139). All humans pass through the stages of infancy, childhood, and adulthood; they experience love and seek honor, but all eventually succumb to the debility of old age and \u201cmere oblivion\u201d (II.vii.164). Orlando returns with Adam and all begin to eat. The duke soon realizes that Orlando is the son of Sir Rowland, the duke\u2019s old friend, and heartily welcomes the young man. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act II, scene vii\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act II, scenes v\u2013vii Both Act II, scene v and Act II, scene vi deal primarily with the melancholy lord, Jaques, who offers a sullen perspective on the otherwise comedic events in Ardenne. He turns Amiens\u2019s song about the pleasures of leisurely life into a means of berating the foresters, and he comes close to playing the part of the fool, in the sense that he turns a critical eye on a world in which he lives but does not fully inhabit. But unlike Feste in Twelfth Night or the fool in King Lear, Jaques does not demonstrate the insight or wisdom that would make his observations truly arresting or illuminating. His most impressive speech in the play begins with a familiar set piece in Elizabethan drama: \u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage, / And all the men and women merely players\u201d (II.vii.138\u2013139). He goes on to describe the seven stages of a man\u2019s life, from infancy to death, through his roles as lover and soldier, but Jaques\u2019s observations may strike us as untrue or banal. His estimation that lovers sigh \u201clike furnace, with a woeful ballad / Made to his mistress\u2019 eyebrow\u201d is humorous, and it certainly describes the kind of intemperate, undiscriminating affection that Silvius shows to Phoebe, or Phoebe to Ganymede (II.vii.147\u2013148). But the criticism seems ill-suited to a play as aware and forgiving of love\u2019s silliness as As You Like It. As a philosopher, Jaques falls short of accurately describing the complexity of Rosalind\u2019s feelings for Orlando; his musings bear the narrow and pinched shortcomings of the habitually sullen. \tJaques\u2019s sullenness blinds him to his own foolishness regarding life. Jaques goes on to describe man\u2019s later years, the decline into second childhood and obliviousness, without teeth, eyesight, taste, or anything else. Countering Jaques\u2019s unflattering picture of old age, Orlando carries Adam to the duke\u2019s banquet table, the old man entering his final years with his loyalty, generosity of spirit, and appetite intact. Although the thought of serving as Duke Frederick\u2019s fool appeals to him, Jaques ultimately lacks the wit, wisdom, and heart to perform the task. When he meets Touchstone in the forest, he sings the clown\u2019s praises, quoting with glee Touchstone\u2019s nihilistic musings on the passage of time: \u201cAnd so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe, / And then from hour to hour we rot and rot\u201d (II.vii.26\u201327). Jaques does not realize that Touchstone\u2019s \u201cdeep--contemplative\u201d speech is a bawdy mockery of his own brooding behavior (II.vii.31). Indeed, throughout the play, Jaques remains so mired in his own moodiness that he sees very little of the world he so desperately wants to criticize. Knowing that Jaques\u2019s eyes are trained on men\u2019s baser instincts, the duke doubts Jaques\u2019s ability to serve as a proper and entertaining fool. Jaques, he feels, would be a boor, berating the courtiers for sins that Jaques himself has committed. This exchange points to an important difference between Jaques and the duke: the former is committed to being unhappy in the world and will suffer in it, while the latter is happy to make the best of the world he is given and will thrive, as the title of the play seems to promise.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126025145/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/asyoulikeit/section4/"}
