{"name": "Act III, scenes iii\u2013v", "summary": "Act III, scene iii  Touchstone and a goatherd named Audrey wander through the forest, while Jaques follows behind them, eavesdropping. Touchstone laments that the gods have not made Audrey \u201cpoetical\u201d (III.iii.12). Were she a lover of poetry, she would appreciate the falsehoods of which all lovers are guilty and would be dishonest, a quality that Touchstone prefers she possess. His reason behind encouraging her dishonesty is that to have beauty and honesty together, as he claims he does in Audrey, is \u201cto have honey a sauce to sugar\u201d (III.iii.25). Nevertheless, Touchstone has arranged to marry Audrey in the forest with Sir Oliver Martext, a vicar from a nearby village, officiating. Touchstone determines that many wives cheat on their husbands, but claims that the horns of cuckoldry are nothing of which to be ashamed. Oliver Martext arrives to perform the wedding ceremony and insists that someone \u201cgive the woman\u201d so that the ceremony is \u201clawful\u201d (III.iii.55\u201358). Jaques offers his services but convinces Touchstone that he should marry in a proper church. The clown counters that a nonchurch wedding will make for an ill marriage and that an ill marriage will make it easier for him to abandon his wife, but in the end he acquiesces. Jaques, Touchstone, and Audrey leave the rather bewildered vicar alone in the forest.

She wants desperately to weep. Rosalind compares Orlando\u2019s hair to that of the infamous betrayer of Christ, Judas. Celia insists that Orlando\u2019s hair is browner than Judas\u2019s, and Rosalind agrees, slowly convincing herself that her lover is no traitor. Celia, however, then suggests that in matters of love, there is little truth in Orlando. A lover\u2019s oath, Celia reasons, is of no more account than that of a bartender. \tCorin enters and interrupts the women\u2019s conversation. He explains that the young shepherd, Silvius, whose complaints about the tribulations of love Rosalind and Celia witness earlier, has decided to woo and win Phoebe. Corin invites the women to see the \u201cpageant\u201d of a hopeless lover and the scornful object of his desire, and Rosalind heads off to see the scene play out (III.iv.46). Indeed, she determines to do more than watch\u2014she plans to intervene in the affair. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene iv\u00a0\u2192  Act III, scene v  Silvius has confessed his love to Phoebe, but his words fall on hostile ears. As the scene opens, he pleads with her not to reject him so bitterly, lest she prove worse than the \u201ccommon executioner,\u201d who has enough decency to ask forgiveness of those he kills (III.v.3). Rosalind and Celia, both still disguised, enter along with Corin to watch Phoebe\u2019s cruel response. Phoebe mocks Silvius\u2019s hyperbolic language, asking why he fails to fall down if her eyes are the murderers he claims them to be. Silvius assures her that the wounds of love are invisible, but Phoebe insists that the shepherd not approach her again until she too can feel these invisible wounds. Rosalind steps out from her hiding place and begins to berate Phoebe, proclaiming that the shepherdess is no great beauty and should consider herself lucky to win Silvius\u2019s love. Confronted by what appears to be a handsome young man who treats her as harshly as she treats Silvius, Phoebe instantly falls in love with Ganymede. Rosalind, realizing this infatuation, mocks Phoebe further. Rosalind and Celia depart, and Phoebe employs Silvius, who can talk so well of love, to help her pursue Ganymede. Phoebe claims that she does not love Ganymede and wonders why she failed to defend herself against such criticism. She determines to write him \u201ca very taunting letter,\u201d and orders Silvius to deliver it (III.v.135). Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene v\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act III, scenes iii\u2013v Although we learn of the romance between Audrey and Touchstone rather late in the game, the relationship is important to the play for many reasons. First, it produces laughs because of the incongruities between the two lovers. Touchstone delights in words and verbiage. He obsesses over them, wrings multiple\u2014and often bawdy\u2014meanings from them, and usually ends up tangling himself and others in them. That he chooses to wed Audrey, a simple goatherd who fails to comprehend the most basic vocabulary\u2014the words \u201cfeatures,\u201d \u201cpoetical,\u201d and \u201cfoul\u201d are all beyond her grasp\u2014ensures the laughable absurdity of their exchange (III.iii.4, 13\u201314, 31). Indeed, the play offers few moments more outrageous than Audrey\u2019s declaration of virtue: \u201cI am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul\u201d (III.iii.31). \tThe rustic romance between Audrey and Touchstone also provides a pointed contrast with the flowery, verbose love of Silvius for Phoebe or Orlando for Rosalind. Whereas Phoebe and Silvius are caught up in the poetics of love\u2014with the man in agonizing pursuit of an unattainable but, to his mind, perfect lover\u2014the attraction between Touchstone and Audrey is far from idealized. Indeed, if Audrey cannot grasp the meaning of the word \u201cpoetical,\u201d there is little hope that she will be able to fulfill the part dictated to her by literary convention. Ideals have little to do with Touchstone\u2019s affections for Audrey. By his own admission, the clown\u2019s passions are much easier to understand. In explaining to Jaques his decision to marry Audrey, Touchstone says, \u201cAs the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires\u201d (III.iii.66\u201367). Here, Touchstone equates his sexual desire to various restraining devices for animals. Sexual gratification, or \u201cnibbling,\u201d to use Touchstone\u2019s phrase, will keep his otherwise untamed passions in check (III.iii.68).<PARAGRAPH>Although Silvius and Phoebe\u2019s and Touchstone and Audrey\u2019s are two very different kinds of love relationships, taken together they form a complete satire of the two major influences on the play\u2014-pastoralism and courtly love. In pastoral literature, city dwellers take to the country in order to commune with and learn valuable lessons from its inhabitants. Audrey represents a truly rural individual, uncorrupted by the politics of court life, but she is, in all respects, far from ideal. In her supreme want of intelligence, Audrey shows the absurd unreality of the pastoral ideal of eloquent shepherds and shepherdesses. Silvius aspires to such eloquence and nearly achieves it, and his poetic plea for Phoebe\u2019s mercy conforms to the conventions of the distraught but always lyrically precise lover. But Phoebe exposes the absurdity of Silvius\u2019s lines by dragging romance into the harsh, unforgiving light of reality. When taken literally, his insistence that his lover\u2019s eyes are his \u201cexecutioner\u201d (III.v.3) seems hopelessly lame when Phoebe demands, \u201cNow show the wound mine eye hath made in thee\u201d (III.v.20). \tIf Audrey and Touchstone\u2019s and Phoebe and Silvius\u2019s relationships stand at opposite ends of the romance continuum, then -Rosalind, in her courtship of Orlando, struggles to find a more livable middle ground. Although Phoebe wisely points out the literal flaws in Silvius\u2019s verse, she cannot help falling into the same trap herself regarding Ganymede. In the entire play, only Rosalind can appreciate both the ideal and the real. Although she possesses the unflinching vision required to chastise Phoebe for her cruelty and Silvius for his blindness to it, she cannot help but indulge in the absurdity of romantic love, allowing herself to have a fit over Orlando\u2019s tardiness. This inconsistency may explain why Rosalind is such a seductive, winning character: in her ability to experience and appreciate all emotions, she appeals to everyone.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126025145/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/asyoulikeit/section6/"}
