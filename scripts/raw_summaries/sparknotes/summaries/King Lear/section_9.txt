{"name": "Act 4, scenes 6\u20137", "summary": "Act 4, scene 6 Still disguised, Edgar leads Gloucester toward Dover. Edgar pretends to take Gloucester to the cliff, telling him that they are going up steep ground and that they can hear the sea. Finally, he tells Gloucester that they are at the top of the cliff and that looking down from the great height gives him vertigo. He waits quietly nearby as Gloucester prays to the gods to forgive him. Gloucester can no longer bear his suffering and intends to commit suicide. He falls to the ground, fainting. Edgar wakes Gloucester up. He no longer pretends to be Poor Tom but now acts like an ordinary gentleman, although he still doesn\u2019t tell Gloucester that he is his son. Edgar says that he saw him fall all the way from the cliffs of Dover and that it is a miracle that he is still alive. Clearly, Edgar states, the gods do not want Gloucester to die just yet. Edgar also informs Gloucester that he saw the creature who had been with him at the top of the cliff and that this creature was not a human being but a devil. Gloucester accepts Edgar\u2019s explanation that the gods have preserved him and resolves to endure his sufferings patiently. Lear, wandering across the plain, stumbles upon Edgar and Gloucester. Crowned with wild flowers, he is clearly mad. He babbles to Edgar and Gloucester, speaking both irrationally and with a strange perceptiveness. He recognizes Gloucester, alluding to Gloucester\u2019s sin and source of shame\u2014his adultery. Lear pardons Gloucester for this crime, but his thoughts then follow a chain of associations from adultery to copulation to womankind, culminating in a tirade against women and sexuality in general. Lear\u2019s disgust carries him to the point of incoherence, as he deserts iambic pentameter (the verse form in which his speeches are written) and spits out the words \u201cFie, fie, fie! pah! pah!\u201d (4.6.126). Cordelia\u2019s people enter seeking King Lear. Relieved to find him at last, they try to take him into custody to bring him to Cordelia. When Lear runs away, Cordelia\u2019s men follow him. Oswald comes across Edgar and Gloucester on the plain. He does not recognize Edgar, but he plans to kill Gloucester and collect the reward from Regan. Edgar adopts yet another persona, imitating the dialect of a peasant from the west of England. He defends Gloucester and kills Oswald with a cudgel. As he dies, Oswald entrusts Edgar with his letters. Gloucester is disappointed not to have been killed. Edgar reads with interest the letter that Oswald carries to Edmund. In the letter, Goneril urges Edmund to kill Albany if he gets the opportunity, so that Edmund and Goneril can be together. Edgar is outraged; he decides to keep the letter and show it to Albany when the time is right. Meanwhile, he buries Oswald nearby and leads Gloucester off to temporary safety.<PARAGRAPH>Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act 4, scene 6\u00a0\u2192  Act 4, scene 7 In the French camp, Cordelia speaks with Kent. She knows his real identity, but he wishes it to remain a secret to everyone else. Lear, who has been sleeping, is brought in to Cordelia. He only partially recognizes her. He says that he knows now that he is senile and not in his right mind, and he assumes that Cordelia hates him and wants to kill him, just as her sisters do. Cordelia tells him that she forgives him for banishing her. Meanwhile, the news of Cornwall\u2019s death is repeated in the camp, and we learn that Edmund is now leading Cornwall\u2019s troops. The battle between France and England rapidly approaches. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act 4, scene 7\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act 4, scenes 6\u20137 Besides moving the physical action of the play along, these scenes forward the play\u2019s psychological action. The strange, marvelous scene of Gloucester\u2019s supposed fall over the nonexistent cliffs of Dover, Lear\u2019s mad speeches to Gloucester and Edgar in the wilderness, and the redemptive reconciliation between Cordelia and her not-quite-sane father all set the stage for the resolution of the play\u2019s emotional movement in Act 5. The psychological motivations behind Gloucester\u2019s attempted suicide and Edgar\u2019s manipulation of it are complicated and ambiguous. Gloucester\u2019s death wish, which reflects his own despair at the cruel, uncaring universe\u2014and perhaps the play\u2019s despair as well\u2014would surely have been troubling to the self-consciously Christian society of Renaissance England. Shakespeare gets around much of the problem by setting King Lear in a pagan past; despite the fact that the play is full of Christian symbols and allusions, its characters pray only to the gods and never to the Christian God. Clearly, Edgar wants his father to live. He refuses to share in Gloucester\u2019s despair and still seeks a just and happy resolution to the events of the play. In letting Gloucester think that he has attempted suicide, Edgar manipulates Gloucester\u2019s understanding of divine will: he says to Gloucester after the latter\u2019s supposed fall and rebirth, \u201cThy life\u2019s a miracle. . . . / . . . / The clearest gods . . . / . . . have preserved thee\u201d (4.6.55, 73\u201374). Edgar not only stops Gloucester\u2019s suicidal thoughts but also shocks him into a rebirth. He tells his father that he should \u201cbear free and patient thoughts\u201d: his life has been given back to him and he should take better care of it from now on (4.6.80). In these scenes, King Lear\u2019s madness brings forth some of his strangest and most interesting speeches. As Edgar notes, Lear\u2019s apparent ramblings are \u201cmatter and impertinency mixed! / Reason in madness!\u201d (4.6.168\u2013169). This description is similar to Polonius\u2019s muttering behind Hamlet\u2019s back in Hamlet: \u201cThough this be madness, yet there is method in\u2019t\u201d (Hamlet, 2.2.203\u2013204). Some of Lear\u2019s rambling does indeed seem to be meaningless babble, as when he talks about mice, cheese, and giants. But Lear swiftly moves on to talk of more relevant things. He finally understands that his older daughters, in Act 1, scene 1, and before, were sweet-talking him: \u201cThey flattered me like a dog. . . . To say \u2018aye\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 to everything that I said!\u201d (4.6.95\u201398).<PARAGRAPH>Lear has realized, despite what flatterers have told him and he has believed, that he is as vulnerable to the forces of nature as any human being. He cannot command the rain and thunder and is not immune to colds and fever (the \u201cague\u201d of 4.6.103). Just as, during the storm, he recognizes that beneath each man\u2019s clothing is \u201ca poor, bare, forked animal\u201d (3.4.99\u2013100), Lear now understands that no amount of flattery and praise can make a king different from anyone else: \u201cThrough tattered clothes small vices do appear; / Robes and furred gowns hide all\u201d (4.6.158\u2013159). Armed with this knowledge, Lear can finally reunite with Cordelia and express his newfound humility and beg repentance. \u201cI am a very foolish fond old man\u201d (4.7.61), he tells her sadly, and he admits that she has \u201csome cause\u201d to hate him (4.7.76). Cordelia\u2019s moving response (\u201cNo cause, no, cause\u201d) seals their reconciliation (4.7.77). Love and forgiveness, embodied in Lear\u2019s best daughter, join with humility and repentance, and, for a brief time, happiness prevails. But the forces that Lear\u2019s initial error unleashed\u2014Goneril, Regan, and Edmund, with all their ambition and appetite for destruction\u2014remain at large. We thus turn from happy reconciliation to conflict, as Cordelia leads her troops against the evil that her father\u2019s folly has set loose in Britain.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118050344/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/lear/section10/"}
