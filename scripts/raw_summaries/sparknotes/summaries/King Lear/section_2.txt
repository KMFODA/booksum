{"name": "Act 2, scenes 1\u20132", "summary": "Note: Many editions of King Lear, including The Norton Shakespeare, divide Act 2 into four scenes. Other editions divide Act 2 into only two scenes.  Act 2, scene 1 In Gloucester\u2019s castle, Gloucester\u2019s servant Curan tells Edmund that he has informed Gloucester that the duke of Cornwall and his wife, Regan, are coming to the castle that very night. Curan also mentions vague rumors about trouble brewing between the duke of Cornwall and the duke of Albany. Edmund is delighted to hear of Cornwall\u2019s visit, realizing that he can make use of him in his scheme to get rid of Edgar. Edmund calls Edgar out of his hiding place and tells him that Cornwall is angry with him for being on Albany\u2019s side of their disagreement. Edgar has no idea what Edmund is talking about. Edmund tells Edgar further that Gloucester has discovered his hiding place and that he ought to flee the house immediately under cover of night. When he hears Gloucester coming, Edmund draws his sword and pretends to fight with Edgar, while Edgar runs away. Edmund cuts his arm with his sword and lies to Gloucester, telling him that Edgar wanted him to join in a plot against Gloucester\u2019s life and that Edgar tried to kill him for refusing. The unhappy Gloucester praises Edmund and vows to pursue Edgar, sending men out to search for him. Cornwall and Regan arrive at Gloucester\u2019s house. They believe Edmund\u2019s lies about Edgar, and Regan asks if Edgar is one of the disorderly knights that attend Lear. Edmund replies that he is, and Regan speculates further that these knights put Edgar up to the idea of killing Gloucester in order to acquire Gloucester\u2019s wealth. Regan then asks Gloucester for his advice in answering letters from Lear and Goneril. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act 2, scene 1\u00a0\u2192  Act 2, scene 2 Outside Gloucester\u2019s castle, Kent, still in peasant disguise, meets Oswald, the chief steward of Goneril\u2019s household. Oswald doesn\u2019t recognize Kent from their scuffle in Act 1, scene 4. Kent roundly abuses Oswald, describing him as cowardly, vain, boastful, overdressed, servile, and groveling. Oswald still maintains that he doesn\u2019t know Kent; Kent draws his sword and attacks him. Oswald\u2019s cries for help bring Cornwall, Regan, and Gloucester. Kent replies rudely to their calls for explanation, and Cornwall orders him to be punished in the stocks, a wooden device that shackles a person\u2019s ankles and renders him immobile. Gloucester objects that this humiliating punishment of Lear\u2019s messenger will be seen as disrespectful of Lear himself and that the former king will take offense. But Cornwall and Regan maintain that Kent deserves this treatment for assaulting Goneril\u2019s servant, and they put him in the stocks. After everyone leaves, Kent reads a letter that he has received from Cordelia in which she promises that she will find some way, from her current position in France, to help improve conditions in Britain. The unhappy and resigned Kent dozes off in the stocks.<PARAGRAPH>Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act 2, scene 2\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act 2, scenes 1\u20132 Edmund\u2019s clever scheming to get rid of Edgar shows his cunning and his immorality. His ability to manipulate people calls to mind arguably the greatest of Shakespeare\u2019s villains, Iago, from Othello, who demonstrates a similar capacity for twisting others to serve his own ends. There is a great deal of irony in Edmund\u2019s description to his father of the ways in which Edgar has allegedly schemed against Gloucester\u2019s life. Edmund goes so far as to state that Edgar told him that no one would ever believe Edmund\u2019s word against his because of Edmund\u2019s illegitimate birth. With this remark, Edmund not only calls attention to his bastard status\u2014which is clearly central to his resentful, ambitious approach to life\u2014but proves crafty enough to use it to his advantage. Gloucester\u2019s rejection of Edgar parallels Lear\u2019s rejection of Cordelia in Act 1, scene 1, and reminds us of the similarities between the two unhappy families: Edgar and Cordelia are good children of fathers who reject them in favor of children who do not love them. When Gloucester says, \u201cI never got him\u201d\u2014that is, he never begot, or fathered, him\u2014he seems to be denying that he is actually Edgar\u2019s father, just as Lear has disowned Cordelia (2.1.79). On the other hand, when he praises Edmund as a \u201cloyal and natural boy,\u201d he seems to be acknowledging him as a true son (2.1.85). It is somewhat difficult to know what to make of Kent\u2019s attack on Oswald. Oswald\u2019s eagerness to serve the treacherous Goneril in Act 1, scene 4, has established him as one of the play\u2019s minor villains, but Kent\u2019s barrage of insults and subsequent physical attack on Oswald are clearly unprovoked. Oswald\u2019s failure to fight back may be interpreted as cowardice, but one can also interpret it as Oswald does: he says that he chooses not to attack Kent because of Kent\u2019s \u201cgray beard\u201d\u2014at nearly fifty, Kent is an old man and thus no longer suited for fighting (2.2.55). Kent\u2019s attack seems to be rooted in his anger at Goneril\u2019s treatment of Lear\u2014\u201canger hath a privilege\u201d is the excuse that he gives Cornwall and Regan\u2014and his rage at the hypocrisy surrounding Lear\u2019s betrayal by his daughters (2.2.62). Cornwall\u2019s and Regan\u2019s decision to put Kent in the stocks reinforces what we have already seen of their disrespect for their father. The stocks were a punishment used on common criminals, and their use on Lear\u2019s serving man could easily be interpreted as highly disrespectful to Lear\u2019s royal status. Gloucester announces as much when he protests, \u201cYour purposed low correction / Is such as basest and contemned\u2019st wretches / . . . / Are punished with\u201d (2.2.134\u2013137). Regan, however, ignores his pleas; she almost seems to welcome the idea of inviting Lear\u2019s anger.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118050344/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/lear/section3/"}
