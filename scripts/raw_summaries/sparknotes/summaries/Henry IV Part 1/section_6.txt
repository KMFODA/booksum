{"name": "Act III, scene i", "summary": "Act III, scene i In Wales, at the castle of Owain Glyndwr, the leaders of the rebel armies have gathered to discuss strategy. The two most important members of the Percy family, Hotspur and Worcester, are there, along with Lord Mortimer (Hotspur\u2019s brother-in-law, referred to in the play as his cousin). Their host, Glyndwr, is Mortimer\u2019s father-in-law and the leader of the Welsh rebels. He believes strongly in the ancient Welsh pagan traditions of prophecies, omens, magic, and demons. He claims to be able to call spirits from hell, and he says that at his birth the earth shook and the sky was full of fire. Hotspur makes fun of the Welsh leader\u2019s claims of magical power. Despite his best efforts, Mortimer cannot get his tactless brother-in-law to shut up. Hotspur mocks Glyndwr\u2019s claim to be able to command the devil; Glyndwr then asserts that he has repelled Henry\u2019s invasions three times. By the time the four actually get down to discussing strategy, Glyndwr is none too pleased with his youngest guest. \tThe men take out a large map of Britain and divide it up as they have earlier discussed: after they defeat King Henry, Glyndwr will get the western part of Britain\u2014western England and all of Wales; Mortimer will get the southeast part of England, including London; Hotspur will get the northern part, home to his family. Hotspur begins to complain because he does not like the way that a river curves through his land, and he says that he will have the river straightened out. Irritated, Glyndwr tells Hotspur that he must not do so, and the two bicker again, although Glyndwr ends the dispute this time by giving in. \tAfter Glyndwr leaves the room, Mortimer chides Hotspur for bothering Glyndwr. Hotspur says he is bored and annoyed with Glyndwr\u2019s talk of prophecies and magic. Mortimer reminds him that Glyndwr is a powerful, courageous, and well-read man, and also possibly a dangerous magician. He points out that Glyndwr has been very tolerant of Hotspur\u2019s youthful obnoxiousness. Anyone else, he warns, would have felt the force of Glyndwr\u2019s anger already. Worcester agrees and urges Hotspur to mind his manners and show respect. Hotspur claims unconvincingly that he has learned his lesson. \tGlyndwr brings in Mortimer\u2019s and Hotspur\u2019s wives; the four must say goodbye, for the men must ride off to meet their allies that very night. Lady Mortimer, Glyndwr\u2019s daughter, cannot speak English, and Mortimer knows no Welsh. Lady Mortimer weeps for her husband, who speaks lovingly to her, and Glyndwr translates between them. Mortimer lays his head in her lap, and she sings the company a song in Welsh. Meanwhile, Hotspur and his wife, Lady Percy, bid each other farewell in a half-affectionate, half-fighting manner. By the time Lady Mortimer\u2019s song is over, the formal contracts of agreement among the rebel leaders have been drawn up. The men sign them, and Mortimer, Hotspur, and Worcester then set forth. They are heading to Shrewsbury, near the English border with Wales, to meet the Earl of Northumberland (Hotspur\u2019s father) and his ally, the Douglas of Scotland, who will bring with him a thousand soldiers. Glyndwr, meanwhile, will gather his army, which he plans to lead into England within two weeks. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene i\u00a0\u2192 Analysis  Hotspur\u2019s quick temper and insolence flare up once again in this scene: with a few rude words, he alienates the extremely powerful Owain Glyndwr, one of his family\u2019s most important allies. By this point, Hotspur\u2019s immaturity is apparent as the negative side of his boldness and sharp military instincts. As Worcester insightfully notes, Hotspur\u2019s greatest asset\u2014his boldness and quick temper\u2014is also his worst flaw; he is valiant in battle but cannot manipulate or work with people behind the scenes. This flaw eventually proves a deadly weakness for Hotspur, since manipulation and diplomacy are among the greatest strengths of Prince Harry, his archrival. This tension emphasizes the importance the play places on understanding the qualities of true leadership. \tThis scene also provides us with a strong taste of Welsh culture and tradition, which Glyndwr embodies. The English regarded the ancient Welsh customs and supernatural traditions with mingled disdain and unease. On the one hand, they felt that a more advanced civilization (as they considered themselves) should have no fear of ancient superstitions. On the other hand, however, no one could be sure that the Welsh were not really magicians. This scene recalls the horror with which Westmoreland speaks, in Act I, scene i, about the\u00a0ritualistic mutilations that the Welsh women performed upon the English dead.<PARAGRAPH>Glyndwr himself is a fascinating mix of the Welsh and English worlds. As he rather sternly reminds the insolent Hotspur, he was \u201ctrained up in the English court\u201d and speaks fluent English as well as his native Welsh (III.i.119); as Mortimer further notes, he is \u201cexceedingly well read\u201d\u2014a quality associated with gentlemanliness and urban sophistication (III.i.162). But Glyndwr\u2019s claims to be a magician able to summon demons, along with his insistence on the significance of the omens that he believes filled the sky and earth on the day of his birth, reflects his strong commitment to his pagan heritage. Even Mortimer implies that he believes in Glyndwr\u2019s magic arts, testifying that Glyndwr is \u201cprofited / In strange concealments,\u201d or supernatural skills (III.i.162\u2013163). \tHotspur rudely trivializes Glyndwr\u2019s claims to magic and justified patriotism. To Glyndwr\u2019s boasts about defeating Henry\u2019s attempted invasions and sending him home \u201c[b]ootless,\u201d Hotspur exclaims in mock surprise, \u201cHome without boots, and in foul weather too!\u201d (III.i.64\u201365). Given the gravity of the situation, Hotspur\u2019s punning response at Glyndwr\u2019s expense is inappropriate. \tMortimer\u2019s inability to communicate with his own wife is a further manifestation of the cultural barriers between the English and the Welsh. Unlike Hotspur, however, Mortimer at least shows himself to be aware of the value of understanding other cultures and tongues, despairing, \u201cO, I am ignorance itself in this!\u201d when he cannot understand his wife (III.i.206). The presumably exotic song that Shakespeare has Lady Mortimer sing in Welsh would probably have established a sense of the foreign and the mysterious for an Elizabethan audience\u2014a taste of the \u201cirregular and wild\u201d world that lay just beyond the bounds of late medieval and Renaissance English civilization (I.i.40).", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210120111722/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/henry4pt1/section7/"}
