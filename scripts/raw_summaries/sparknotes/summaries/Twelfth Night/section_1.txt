{"name": "Act I, scenes iii\u2013iv", "summary": "Act I, scene iii In the house of Lady Olivia, we meet Olivia\u2019s uncle, Sir Toby Belch, and Olivia\u2019s waiting-gentlewoman, Maria. Sir Toby lives at Olivia\u2019s house and is cheerful, amusing, and usually tipsy. Maria warns Sir Toby that Olivia is annoyed by his drinking, but Sir Toby shrugs off this admonition. Maria also tells him that she has heard that he has brought a foolish friend to court Olivia: Sir Andrew Aguecheek, who shares Sir Toby\u2019s disreputable habits. Sir Toby protests that Sir Andrew is a perfect match for his niece, because he is very rich and is also accomplished in music and languages, but Maria doesn\u2019t care: in her view, Sir Andrew is a fool, a brawler, and a drunk. Sir Andrew enters and, while Sir Toby is trying to introduce him to Maria, makes a fool of himself by repeatedly getting her name wrong. Evidently, Sir Andrew is a bumbling idiot. After Maria leaves, Sir Andrew and Sir Toby talk and joke like old friends. But Sir Andrew tells Sir Toby that he is discouraged and that he does not think that Olivia likes him. He plans to leave the next morning, and he remarks that Olivia will probably choose Orsino over him. Sir Toby persuades him to stay by flattering him. He says that Olivia will never marry \u201cabove her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit,\u201d so Sir Andrew has a good chance with her (I.iii.90\u201391). Sir Toby compliments his friend\u2019s dancing and, through his encouragement, gets the vain and weak-minded\u2014but good-hearted\u2014Sir Andrew to show off his dancing skills.

After only three days in Orsino\u2019s service, Cesario has already become a favorite of Orsino. Indeed, so much does Orsino favor his new servant that he insists on picking Cesario to go on his most important errand: to carry his messages of love to Olivia. Cesario protests that Olivia, who has ignored Orsino for a long time, is not likely to start listening to his love messages now. But Orsino points out that Cesario is extremely young and handsome\u2014so beautiful, in his lips and features, that he resembles a woman\u2014and that Olivia is sure to be impressed by his attractiveness. Orsino tells Cesario to \u201cact my woes\u201d when he goes to see Olivia\u2014to behave as if he shares Orsino\u2019s adoration for the noblewoman (I.iv.25). After some discussion, Cesario reluctantly agrees to carry the message\u2014reluctantly because, as she tells the audience in a quick aside, Viola herself has fallen in love with Orsino and wishes that she could be his wife. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act I, scene iv\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act I, scenes iii\u2013iv Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Maria are Twelfth Night\u2019s most explicitly comic characters, since they take themselves less seriously than the play\u2019s romantic leads. (Furthermore, the two noblemen\u2019s very names\u2014\u201cBelch\u201d and \u201cAguecheek\u201d\u2014seem comically out of place.) These three provide amusement in different ways, however: Sir Toby seems to be an intelligent man and makes witty puns, to which the equally clever Maria is quick to respond. Sir Andrew Aguecheek, however, appears to be a fool. He doesn\u2019t understand Toby and Maria\u2019s wit, as we see when he is forced to ask Maria, \u201cWhat\u2019s your metaphor?\u201d and \u201c[W]hat\u2019s your jest?\u201d (I.iii.60\u201364). He is also easily flattered and doesn\u2019t realize certain painful truths\u2014that he is not very witty, that Toby and Maria are making fun of him, and that he does not stand a chance with Olivia. Act I, scene iv shows us the developing relationship between Orsino and Cesario. In another useful improbability, we find that, after only three days, Cesario has become a great favorite of the duke. As Orsino\u2019s servant Valentine tells Cesario, \u201cIf the Duke continues these favours towards you, . . . you are like to be much advanced\u201d (I.iv.1\u20132). In the same conversation, Valentine assures Cesario that Orsino isn\u2019t fickle\u2014that he remains steady and constant in his love. Since we have heard Orsino\u2019s flowery speeches about Olivia in Act I, scene i, we may question how sincere or steady his love really is, an uncertainty that grows as the play progresses.<PARAGRAPH>Regardless, the way Orsino talks to Cesario makes it clear that Orsino likes Cesario very much\u2014and his language is closer to that of romantic love than that of ordinary friendship. \u201cCesario,\u201d he tells him, \u201cThou know\u2019st no less but all. I have unclasped / To thee the book even of my secret soul\u201d (I.iv.11\u201313). Clearly, Orsino already seems to be attracted to Cesario in a way that defies our expectations of how male friends interact with one another. This peculiar attraction is further developed when Orsino tells Cesario why he plans to send him to woo Olivia. Orsino explains that Olivia is more likely to listen to Cesario: \u201cShe will attend [Orsino\u2019s repeated messages of love] better in thy youth / Than in a nuncio\u2019s [i.e., messenger\u2019s] of more grave aspect\u201d (I.iv.26-\u201327). Cesario denies Orsino\u2019s claim, but Orsino tells him that he should believe it, because, in his youthfulness, Cesario is as pretty as a young woman. \u201cDiana\u2019s lip / Is not more smooth and rubious [i.e., rosy]\u201d than Cesario\u2019s, Orsino tells him, comparing him favorably to the goddess Diana; and Cesario\u2019s voice, Orsino claims, \u201c[i]s as the maiden\u2019s organ, shrill and sound, / And all is semblative a woman\u2019s part\u201d (I.iv.30\u201333). This series of compliments is both intriguing and complicated. In praising Cesario\u2019s attractiveness, Orsino tells Cesario that he looks like a woman. His interest in having Cesario go to Olivia suggests his belief that Cesario\u2019s womanly beauty will somehow entice Olivia. At the same time, it is difficult not to read in -Orsino\u2019s words the suggestion that he too finds Cesario attractive: after all, Cesario reminds him strongly of a beautiful young woman.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210309223222/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/twelfthnight/section2/"}
