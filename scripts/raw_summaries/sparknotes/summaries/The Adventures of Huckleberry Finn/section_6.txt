{"name": "Chapters 14\u201316", "summary": "Chapter 14 Jim and Huck find a number of valuables among the robbers\u2019 bounty from the Walter Scott, mostly books, clothes, and cigars. As they relax in the woods and wait for nightfall before traveling again, Huck reads books from the wreck, and the two discuss what Huck calls their \u201cadventures.\u201d Jim says he doesn\u2019t enjoy adventures, as they could easily end in his death or capture. Huck astonishes Jim with stories of kings, first reading from books and then adding some of his own, made-up stories. Jim had only heard of King Solomon, whom he considers a fool for wanting to chop a baby in half. Huck cannot convince Jim otherwise. Huck tells Jim about the dauphin (whom Huck mistakenly calls the \u201cdolphin\u201d), the son of the executed King Louis XVI of France. The dauphin currently is rumored to be wandering America. Jim refuses to believe that the French do not speak English, as Huck explains. Huck tries to argue the point with Jim but gives up in defeat.

He tries to paddle back to the raft, but the fog is so thick that he loses all sense of direction. After a lonely time adrift, Huck reunites with Jim, who is asleep on the raft. Jim is thrilled to see Huck alive, but Huck tries to trick Jim by pretending that Jim dreamed up their entire separation. Jim tells Huck the story of his dream, making the fog and the troubles he faced on the raft into an allegory of their journey to the free states. But soon Jim notices all the debris, dirt, and tree branches that collected on the raft while it was adrift. He gets mad at Huck for making a fool of him after he had worried about him so much. \u201cIt was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger,\u201d Huck says, but he eventually apologizes and does not regret it. He feels bad about hurting Jim. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Chapter 15\u00a0\u2192  Chapter 16 Jim and Huck worry that they will miss Cairo, the town at the mouth of the Ohio River, which runs into the free states. Meanwhile, Huck\u2019s conscience troubles him deeply about helping Jim escape from his \u201crightful owner,\u201d Miss Watson, especially after all she has done for Huck. Jim talks on and on about going to the free states, especially about his plan to earn money to buy the freedom of his wife and children. If their masters refuse to give up Jim\u2019s family, Jim plans to have some abolitionists kidnap them. When Huck and Jim think they see Cairo, Huck goes out on the canoe to check, having secretly resolved to give Jim up. But Huck\u2019s heart softens when he hears Jim call out that Huck is his only friend, the only one to keep a promise to him. Huck comes upon some men in a boat who want to search his raft for escaped slaves. Huck pretends to be grateful, saying no one else would help them. He leads the men to believe that his family is on board the raft and is suffering from smallpox. The men, fearing infection, back away and tell Huck to go further downstream and lie about his family\u2019s condition to get help. Out of pity, they leave Huck forty dollars in gold. Huck feels bad because he thinks he has done wrong in not giving Jim up. However, he realizes he would feel just as bad if he had given Jim up. Huck re\tsolves to disregard morality in the future and do what\u2019s \u201chandiest.\u201d Floating along, Huck and Jim pass several towns and worry that they have passed Cairo in the fog. They stop for the night and resolve to take the canoe upriver but in the morning discover that it has been stolen. They attribute the canoe\u2019s disappearance to continued bad luck from the snakeskin on Jackson\u2019s Island. Later, a steamboat collides with the raft, breaking it apart. Jim and Huck dive off in time but are separated. Huck makes it ashore, but a pack of dogs corners him. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Chapter 16\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Chapters 14\u201316 We see in these chapters that Huck, though open-minded, still largely subscribes to the Southern white conception of the world. When Jim assesses their \u201cadventure,\u201d Huck does admit that he has acted foolishly and jeopardized Jim\u2019s safety, but he qualifies his assessment by adding that Jim is smart\u2014for a black person. Huck also genuinely struggles with the question of whether or not to turn over Jim to the white men who ask if he is harboring any runaway slaves. In some sense, Huck still believes that turning Jim in would be the \u201cright\u201d thing to do, and he struggles with the idea that Miss Watson is a slave owner yet still seems to be a \u201cgood\u201d person. Over the course of these chapters, as he spends more time with Jim, Huck is forced to question the facts that white society has taught him and that he has taken for granted.<PARAGRAPH>The arguments Huck and Jim have over Huck\u2019s stories provide remarkable mini-allegories about slavery and race. When Huck tells the tale of King Solomon, who threatened to chop a baby in half, Jim argues that Solomon had so many children that he became unable to value human life properly. Huck\u2019s comments lead us to compare Jim\u2019s assessment of Solomon with whites\u2019 treatments of blacks at the time\u2014as infinitely replaceable bodies, indistinguishable from one another. Later, Huck tells Jim that people in France don\u2019t speak English. Huck tries to convince the skeptical Jim by pointing out that cats and cows don\u2019t \u201ctalk\u201d the same, and that, by analogy, neither should French people and American people. Jim points out that both are men and that the analogy is inappropriate. Although Jim is misinformed in a sense, he is correct in his assessment of Huck\u2019s analogy. Jim\u2019s argument provides yet another subtle reminder that, in American society at the time, not all men are treated as men. Although Jim\u2019s discussion with Huck shows that both have clever minds, we see that Jim is less imprisoned by conventional wisdom than Huck, who has grown up at least partly in mainstream white society. We see the moral and societal importance of Huck and Jim\u2019s journey in Huck\u2019s profound moral crisis about whether he should return Jim to Miss Watson. In the viewpoint of Southern white society, Huck has effectively stolen $800\u2014the price the slave trader has offered for Jim\u2014from Miss Watson. However, Jim\u2019s comment that Huck is the only white man ever to keep his word to him shows that Huck has been treating Jim not as a slave but as a man. This newfound knowledge, along with Huck\u2019s guilt, keep Huck from turning Jim in. Huck realizes that he would have felt worse for doing the \u201cright\u201d thing and turning Jim in than he does for not turning Jim in. When Huck reaches this realization, he makes a decision to reject conventional morality in favor of what his conscience dictates. This decision represents a big step in Huck\u2019s development, as he realizes that his conscience may be a better guide than the dictates of the white society in which he has been raised.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118112326/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/huckfinn/section7/"}
