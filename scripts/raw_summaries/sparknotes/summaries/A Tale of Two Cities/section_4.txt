The men drink together and discuss the day\u2019s court proceedings. Stryver, nicknamed \u201cthe lion,\u201d compliments his friend, \u201cthe jackal,\u201d for the \u201crare point\u201d that he made regarding Darnay\u2019s identification. However, he laments Carton\u2019s moodiness. Ever since their days in school together, Stryver observes, Carton has fluctuated between highs and lows, \u201cnow in spirits and now in despondency!\u201d Carton shrugs off Stryver\u2019s accusation that his life lacks a unified direction. Unable to match Stryver\u2019s vaulting ambition, Carton claims that he has no other choice but to live his life \u201cin rust and repose.\u201d Attempting to change the subject, Stryver turns the conversation to Lucie, praising her beauty. Carton dismisses her as a \u201cgolden-haired doll,\u201d but Stryver wonders about Carton\u2019s true feelings for her.

Finding Manette and his daughter not at home, he converses with Miss Pross. They discuss why the doctor continues to keep his shoemaker\u2019s bench.  Their conversation also touches on the number of suitors who come to call on Lucie. Miss Pross complains that they come by the dozen, by the hundred\u2014all \u201cpeople who are not at all worthy of Ladybird.\u201d In Miss Pross\u2019s opinion, the only man worthy of Lucie is her own brother, Solomon Pross, who, she laments, disqualified himself by making a certain mistake. Lorry knows, however, that Solomon is a scoundrel who robbed Miss Pross of her possessions and left her in poverty. He goes on to ask if Manette ever returns to his shoemaking, and Pross assures him that the doctor no longer thinks about his dreadful imprisonment. Lucie and Manette return, and soon Darnay joins them. Darnay relates that a workman, making alterations to a cell in the Tower of London, came upon a carving in the wall: \u201cD I G.\u201d At first, the man mistook these for some prisoner\u2019s initials, but he soon enough realized that they spelled the word dig. Upon digging, the man discovered the ashes of a scrap of paper on which the prisoner must have written a message. The story startles Manette, but he soon recovers. Carton arrives and sits with the others near a window in the drawing room. The footsteps on the street below make a terrific echo. Lucie imagines that the footsteps belong to people that will eventually enter into their lives. Carton comments that if Lucie\u2019s speculation is true, then a great crowd must be on its way.

Alongside his colleague Stryver, Carton seems little more than an assistant. He lacks ambition; in the courtroom he spends his time staring at the ceiling; outside of it, he spends his time getting drunk. Carton accepts his pathetic state\u2014he says to Stryver matter-of-factly, \u201cyou have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into mine.\u201d Yet, for all of his supposed indifference, he betrays his desire for a better, more exalted life. Carton alludes several times to the respectable life that he might have lived. At the end of Chapter 4, he admits to hating Darnay because the man reminds him of what he could have been. He echoes this sentiment in Chapter 5, telling Stryver, \u201cI thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow [as Darnay], if I had had any luck.\u201d These feelings evidence his resentful awareness of Darnay as his double\u2014a successful and happy double, and thus a mocking one. Carton views Darnay as a concrete manifestation of a life he might have led, a life preferable to his own. The closing of the chapter alludes to the secret longings of a man who will not admit to having any:<PARAGRAPH>In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight. A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its pillow was wet with wasted tears.  A great gulf exists between the life that Carton leads and the life that he imagines for himself, between the type of man that he is and the type of man that he dreams of being. Carton\u2019s complex and conflicted inner life paves the way for his dramatic development, which eventually elevates him out of his jackal status. Dickens employs masterful foreshadowing in Chapter 6, as he uses these scenes both to hint at Carton\u2019s eventual ascendance into glory and to anticipate two vital plot turns. The discovery of the mysterious letter in the Tower of London, and Manette\u2019s distress upon hearing of it, foreshadows the moment when, during a later trial, the prosecution will confront the doctor with a letter he wrote while imprisoned in the Bastille. As the second trial forms the dramatic core of the latter half of the novel, the discovery of this second letter forms a crucial part of the plot and dictates the course of the characters\u2019 lives. By introducing the story of a first and parallel letter, Dickens prepares the reader for the discovery of the second. As soon as the second letter surfaces, the reader will instantly recognize it as important. The second event that Dickens foreshadows is the French Revolution itself. The \u201chundreds of people\u201d to which the title of Chapter 6 owes its name refers not to Lucie\u2019s suitors (whose numbers Miss Pross clearly exaggerates) but to the multitude of angry, mutinous revolutionaries who, as Lucie and Carton foretell, will soon march into the characters\u2019 lives.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227001559/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/a-tale-of-two-cities/section5/"}
