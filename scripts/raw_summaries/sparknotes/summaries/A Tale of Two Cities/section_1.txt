See Important Quotations Explained  As its title promises, this brief chapter establishes the era in which the novel takes place: England and France in 1775. The age is marked by competing and contradictory attitudes\u2014\u201cIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times\u201d\u2014but resembles the \u201cpresent period\u201d in which Dickens writes. In England, the public worries over religious prophecies, popular paranormal phenomena in the form of \u201cthe Cock-lane ghost,\u201d and the messages that a colony of British subjects in America has sent to King George III. France, on the other hand, witnesses excessive spending and extreme violence, a trend that anticipates the erection of the guillotine. Yet in terms of peace and order, English society cannot \u201cjustify much national boasting\u201d either\u2014crime and capital punishment abound.

The journey proves so treacherous that the three passengers must dismount from the carriage and hike alongside it as it climbs a steep hill. From out of the great mists, a messenger on horseback appears and asks to speak to Jarvis Lorry of Tellson\u2019s Bank. The travelers react warily, fearing that they have come upon a highwayman or robber. Mr. Lorry, however, recognizes the messenger\u2019s voice as that of Jerry Cruncher, the odd-job man at Tellson\u2019s, and accepts his message. The note that Jerry passes him reads: \u201cWait at Dover for Mam\u2019selle.\u201d Lorry instructs Jerry to return to Tellson\u2019s with this reply: \u201cRecalled to Life.\u201d Confused and troubled by the \u201cblazing strange message,\u201d Jerry rides on to deliver it.

See Important Quotations Explained  The narrator ponders the secrets and mysteries that each human being poses to every other: Lorry, as he rides on in the mail coach with two strangers, constitutes a case in point. Dozing, he drifts in and out of dreams, most of which revolve around the workings of Tellson\u2019s bank. Still, there exists \u201canother current of impression that never cease[s] to run\u201d through Lorry\u2019s mind\u2014the notion that he makes his way to dig someone out of a grave. He imagines repetitive conversations with a specter, who tells Lorry that his body has lain buried nearly eighteen years. Lorry informs his imaginary companion that he now has been \u201crecalled to life\u201d and asks him if he cares to live. He also asks, cryptically, \u201cShall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?\u201d The ghost\u2019s reaction to this question varies, as he sometimes claims that he would die were he to see this woman too soon; at other times, he weeps and pleads to see her immediately.

After shedding his travel clothes, he emerges as a well-dressed businessman of sixty. That afternoon, a waiter announces that Lucie Manette has arrived from London. Lorry meets the \u201cshort, slight, pretty figure\u201d who has received word from the bank that \u201csome intelligence\u2014or discovery\u201d has been made \u201crespecting the small property of my poor father . . . so long dead.\u201d After reiterating his duties as a businessman, Lorry relates the real reason that Tellson\u2019s has summoned Lucie to Paris. Her father, once a reputed doctor, has been found alive. \u201cYour father,\u201d Lorry reports to her, \u201chas been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.\u201d Lucie goes into shock, and her lively and protective servant, Miss Pross, rushes in to attend to her. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Chapter 4: The Preparation\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Chapters 1\u20134 The opening sentence of the novel makes clear, as the title itself does, the importance of doubles in the text: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair. . . .  Doubles prove essential to the novel\u2019s structure, plot, and dominant themes. The idea of resurrection, a theme that emerges in these early pages, would not be possible without some form of its opposite\u2014death. In order to pave the way for the first such resurrection\u2014the recalling to life of the long-imprisoned Doctor Manette\u2014Dickens does much to establish a dark, ominous tone suggestive of death. From the mist-obscured route of the Dover mail coach to the darkly paneled room in which Lorry meets Lucie Manette, the opening chapters brim with gloomy corners and suggestive shadows.<PARAGRAPH>These descriptions of darkness and secrets also contribute to the gothic atmosphere of the novel\u2019s opening. Gothic literature, a genre that establishes an uneasy, mysterious mood through the use of remote, desolate settings, supernatural or macabre events, and violence, dominated much of fiction from the late eighteenth century through the end of the nineteenth century. Such classics as Frankenstein (1818), by Mary Shelley, and Wuthering Heights (1847), by Emily Bront\u00eb, helped establish a strong tradition of gothic themes in British literature of this period. Jerry Cruncher\u2019s mysterious appearance during the treacherous nighttime journey, and Lorry\u2019s macabre visions of disinterring a body, hearken back to the eerie and supernatural feel of A Tale of Two Cities\u2019 gothic predecessors. The obscurity that permeates these pages points to the \u201cwonderful fact\u201d that Dickens continuously ponders: every person in every room in every house that he passes possesses a secret, unknown to anyone\u2014even closest friends, family, and lover. As the novel progresses, the reader witnesses Dickens digging\u2014much as Lorry anticipates having to \u201cdig\u201d the doctor out of his ruinous prison experience\u2014for the secrets that provide his characters with their essences and motivations. In typical Dickensian manner, this project of discovery happens bit by bit: secrets emerge only very slowly. Although the horrible effects of Doctor Manette\u2019s incarceration become clear in the next few chapters, the reader doesn\u2019t learn the causes of these effects until the end of the novel. This narrative tactic owes much to the form in which Dickens wrote much of his work. A Tale of Two Cities was published as a serial piece\u2014that is, in weekly installments from April 20 to November 26, 1859. The original serial format provides the reason for the novel\u2019s relatively short chapters and specific chapter subheadings, which, read in sequence, offer a skeletal outline of the plot. For example, the first three chapters of the second book bear the subheadings \u201cFive Years Later,\u201d \u201cA Sight,\u201d and \u201cA Disappointment,\u201d respectively.  In addition to his plentiful literary talents, Dickens also possessed a shrewd businessman\u2019s sense. He remained keenly aware of what his reading public wanted and, unlike most artists of his caliber, unapologetically admitted to aiming for the largest possible readership. As he had done previously, with A Tale of Two Cities, Dickens set his sights on writing a so-called popular novel. One means of hooking readers into the story was to create a climate of suspense. Within the first four chapters, Dickens already leaves the reader with many questions that need to be answered, creating a sense of excitement and anticipation.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227001559/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/a-tale-of-two-cities/section2/"}
