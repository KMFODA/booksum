{"name": "Book the Second The Golden Thread Chapters 7\u20139", "summary": "Chapter 7: Monseigneur in Town Monseigneur, a great lord in the royal court, holds a reception in Paris. He surrounds himself with the greatest pomp and luxury. For example, he has four serving men help him drink his chocolate. The narrator tells us that Monseigneur\u2019s money corrupts everyone who touches it. Monseigneur parades around his guests briefly and then returns to his sanctuary. Miffed at Monseigneur\u2019s haughtiness, one guest, the Marquis Evr\u00e9monde, condemns Monseigneur as he leaves. The Marquis orders his carriage to be raced through the city streets, delighting to see the commoners nearly run down by his horses. Suddenly the carriage jolts to a stop. A child lies dead under its wheels. The Marquis tosses a few coins to the boy\u2019s father, a man named Gaspard, and to the wine shop owner Defarge, who tries to comfort Gaspard. As the Marquis drives away, a coin comes flying back into the carriage, thrown in bitterness. He curses the commoners, saying that he would willingly ride over any of them. Madame Defarge watches the scene, knitting the entire time.

There, too, the people live wretched lives, exploited, poor, and starving. As he looks over the submissive faces of the peasants, he singles out a road-mender whom he passed on his journey, a man whose fixed stare bothered him. He demands to know what the road-mender was staring at, and the man responds that someone was holding onto the bottom of the carriage. The Marquis continues on his way and soon comes upon a peasant woman, mourning at a rustic graveside. The woman stops him and begs that he provide her husband\u2019s grave with some stone or marker, lest he be forgotten, but the Marquis drives away, unmoved. He arrives at his chateau and, upon entering, asks if Monsieur Charles has arrived from England.

Darnay tells his uncle that he wants to renounce the title and property that he stands to inherit when the Marquis dies. The family\u2019s name, Darnay contends, is associated with \u201cfear and slavery.\u201d He insists that the family has consistently acted shamefully, \u201cinjuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure.\u201d The Marquis dismisses these protests, urging his nephew to accept his \u201cnatural destiny.\u201d The next morning, the Marquis is found dead with a knife through his heart. Attached to the knife is a note that reads: \u201cDrive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques.\u201d Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Chapter 9: The Gorgon\u2019s Head\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Chapters 7\u20139 In Chapter 5 of Book the First, we read a description of the French public squabbling over the spilled contents of a broken wine cask; this passage, in its indictment of the greed and viciousness of the mob, forms the backbone of Dickens\u2019s criticism against the impending revolution. In this section, in contrast, Dickens expresses an equal disapproval for the aristocracy whose vile mistreatment of the peasantry contributes to the revolution. Again, Dickens uses sarcasm to great effect as he describes the Monseigneur\u2019s ridiculous dependence on his serving men: It was impossible for Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men; he must have died of two.  Dickens\u2019s choice of the word escutcheon, referring to a family coat-of-arms, is key to our understanding of Monseigneur. For this emblem represents what the he sees as a power inherent to his family\u2019s bloodline, an innate nobility that he thinks justifies his absurd lavishness. Dickens undercuts Monseigneur\u2019s reverence for this symbol of his own power by commenting on his ridiculous fear that he might damage his reputation should he prove insufficiently ostentatious in the frivolous act of drinking chocolate. Moreover, in noting Monseigneur\u2019s deep interest in the ritual of imbibing his little treat, Dickens contrasts him with the more loftily motivated characters in the novel. While the novel\u2019s worthy characters act according to selfless and righteous goals, the Monseigneur conducts himself according to base and earthly instincts. Dickens uses the Marquis Evr\u00e9monde to give a similar portrait of the aristocracy as elitist. The Marquis displays no sympathy for Gaspard, the father of the boy whom his carriage crushes. Rather, he believes that his noble blood justifies his malicious treatment of his plebian subjects. In tossing the coins to Gaspard, he aims to buy his way out of the predicament and rid his own conscience of the nuisance of Gaspard\u2019s grief. He believes that it is the commoner\u2019s lot in life to struggle and suffer. Likewise, he has no doubt that his nephew\u2019s rightful station is to dominate commoners, referring to his nephew\u2019s noble blood as his \u201cnatural destiny.\u201d<PARAGRAPH>Dickens sets up the Marquis as a representative of the French aristocracy and, as such, a direct cause of the imminent revolution. Using a device called personification, he creates human manifestations of such abstract concepts as greed, oppression, and hatred. The Marquis, so exaggeratedly cruel and flamboyant, hardly seems an actual human being\u2014hardly a realistic character. Instead, the Marquis stands as a symbol or personification of the \u201cinhuman abandonment of consideration\u201d endemic to the French aristocracy during the eighteenth century. Dickens advances this impression of the Marquis\u2019 character in the opening passage of Chapter 9, when he describes the nobleman\u2019s chateau: It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, with a large stone court-yard before it, and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony business altogether with heavy stone balustrades . . . and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in all directions. As if the Gorgon\u2019s head had surveyed it, when it was finished, two centuries ago.  The repetition of the word stone solidifies, as it were, our impression of the man who lives in the chateau. His heart, Dickens suggests, possesses the same severity as the castle\u2019s walls. The mention of the Gorgon\u2014one of three Greek mythological sisters who had snakes for hair and turned anyone who looked at them to stone\u2014foreshadows the death of the Marquis. For by the end of the chapter, the chateau has one more stone face added to its collection\u2014the dead Marquis\u2019 face, which the narrator describes as \u201clike a stone mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified.\u201d Lying dead on his pillow, the Marquis serves as a warning of the violence and bloodshed to come, initiated by the masses who can no longer abide the aristocracy\u2019s heartless oppression of them.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227001559/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/a-tale-of-two-cities/section6/"}
