See Important Quotations Explained  Entering Frome\u2019s kitchen, the narrator is unable to tell which of the\u00a0two women in the room had been speaking upon the men\u2019s arrival. Both are slight and gray-haired, and one starts preparing the\u00a0evening meal as the other sits huddled in the corner by the stove.\u00a0The narrator observes the marked poverty and squalor of the place,\u00a0and Frome notes the coldness of the room with a tone of -apology. The woman in the corner attempts to explain, blaming the\u00a0other woman for having only just started the fire. The narrator\u00a0then recognizes the whining voice he heard previously as the voice of the seated woman. As the other woman comes back around to the table to set a pie in place, Frome introduces her to the narrator as his wife and then proceeds to introduce the seated woman as Miss Mattie Silver. The next morning, the narrator returns to his lodgings, to the great relief of Mrs. Hale, who had given him up for dead. Mrs. Hale and her mother, Mrs. Varnum, are most surprised to learn of Frome\u2019s exceeding generosity toward the narrator, and they react with downright amazement at his announcement that he has spent the night at the Frome household. The narrator senses a strong hint of curiosity in the two women regarding Frome\u2019s hospitality. Mrs. Hale submits that she has spent a great deal of time visiting the Fromes, but for the last twenty years hardly anyone but herself and their doctors has ever set foot in the household. After supper, Mrs. Varnum retires for the evening, and Mrs. Hale and the narrator sit in the parlor for a further conversation about the Fromes. Mrs. Hale begins to recount the terrible aftermath of the smash-up, but the mere memory of Mattie\u2019s convalescence suffices to bring her to tears. Gathering her wits, Mrs. Hale continues with her tale, describing to the narrator Zeena\u2019s mysteriously silent reaction to the events and her gracious decision to receive Mattie back into their household as soon as she could be moved. Responding to the narrator\u2019s gentle queries, Mrs. Hale explains that Mattie has lived with the Fromes ever since and that Zeena has done much of the caretaking for the three of them. Expressing pity for them and marveling at their resilience, Mrs. Hale seems to have concluded her account; however, she then collects herself to make one final remark. Removing her spectacles and leaning toward the narrator in confidence, she declares in a lowered voice that Mattie would have been better off dying after the accident, for, as it stands, \u201cI don\u2019t see\u2019s there\u2019s much difference between the Fromes up at the farm and the Fromes down in the graveyard; \u2019cept that down there they\u2019re all quiet, and the women have got to hold their tongues.\u201d Analysis In this brief epilogue, Wharton summons us back to the present, resuming the narrator\u2019s description of his visit to the Frome household. The result is an abrupt and curtailed view of Frome\u2019s plight, of which we now hold a background understanding. As she did in the novel\u2019s opening scenes, Wharton once again delays the revelation of character, describing the individuals at hand before she names them. From the neutral narrator\u2019s description, it is initially difficult to tell which woman is which, and when we hear that one speaks in a \u201cwhine,\u201d the word Wharton uses earlier to describe Zeena\u2019s voice, we assume that this complainer is Zeena\u2014only to realize, with a trace of horror, that the voice belongs to Mattie. Thus, everything comes full circle, and the cyclical nature of life on the farm is embodied in the terrible fate of Ethan and the women. Instead of finding escape in suicide, he and Mattie have ended up in a state of living death, in which all Mattie\u2019s vitality has been leeched away, and she has transformed into a carbon copy of her former opposite, Zeena. Zeena herself, appropriately enough, has been restored to greater health by the necessity of caring for her disabled husband and cousin\u2014as if she can be healthy only when others suffer. Certain aspects of the characters have remained constant throughout. Always quiet and inscrutable, Zeena remains impossible to interpret, and the reader is left ignorant of her opinions about the situation. \u201cNobody knows Zeena\u2019s thoughts,\u201d Mrs. Hale says, and the text confirms that her \u201cpale opaque eyes . . . revealed nothing and reflected nothing.\u201d Nonetheless, one can imagine her taking a kind of perverse delight in the failure of Ethan and Mattie\u2019s attempt to escape her, as well as in the brutal justice of their fate.<PARAGRAPH>Once again we witness the recurrence of the theme of physical surroundings as destiny. Ethan, Zeena, and Mattie all have become trapped\u2014by snow and poverty and their disabilities\u2014in the decaying farmhouse, and they will be trapped there forever, as Mrs. Hale\u2019s closing words remind us: they will join the other Fromes in the graveyard, alongside the headstone of the earlier Ethan Frome and his wife, Endurance. And indeed, for Ethan himself, endurance is all that remains: his attempt at rebellion and escape has failed, and he ends where he began, trapped by illness, poverty, and winter in Starkfield, waiting for death.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210309051833/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/frome/section10/"}
