{"name": "Chapters 9\u201312", "summary": "Chapter 9  The next morning, Fagin takes out a box full of jewelry and watches. He notices Oliver observing him. Fagin grabs a bread knife and asks Oliver if he was awake an hour before. Oliver says he was not, and Fagin regains his kindly demeanor. \tThe Artful Dodger returns with another boy, named Charley Bates. Fagin asks if they worked hard that morning. The Dodger produces two pocketbooks, and Charley pulls out four handkerchiefs. Fagin says that they will have to teach Oliver how to pick out the marks on the handkerchiefs with a needle. Oliver does not realize he has joined a band of pickpockets, so he believes their jokes about teaching him how to make handkerchiefs and pocketbooks. \tDodger and Charley practice picking Fagin\u2019s pockets. Two young women, Bet and Nancy, whom the narrator describes as \u201cremarkably free and agreeable,\u201d drop in for drinks. Fagin gives all of them some money and sends them out. Fagin lets Oliver practice taking a handkerchief out of his pocket and gives him a shilling for a job well done.  Chapter 10  For days, Fagin keeps Oliver indoors practicing the art of picking pockets. Oliver notices that Fagin punishes the Dodger and Charley if they return home empty-handed. Finally, Fagin sends Oliver out with the Dodger and Charley to \u201cwork.\u201d \tAfter some time, the Dodger notices a wealthy gentleman absorbed in reading at a bookstall. Oliver watches with horror as Charley and the Dodger sneak up behind the man and steal his handkerchief. He finally understands the nature of Fagin\u2019s work. \tThe gentleman turns and sees Oliver running away. Thinking that Oliver is the thief, he raises a cry. The Dodger and Charley see Oliver running past them, so they join in, crying, \u201cStop thief!\u201d A large crowd joins the pursuit. A police officer arrives and grabs Oliver by the collar, ignoring the boy\u2019s protests of his innocence. The gentleman who was robbed asks the police officer not to hurt Oliver and follows them to the police station.<PARAGRAPH> Chapter 11  The officer locks Oliver in a jail cell to await his appearance before Mr. Fang, the district magistrate. Mr. Brownlow, the gentleman, protests that he does not want to press charges. He thinks he recognizes something in Oliver\u2019s face, but cannot put his finger on it. Oliver faints in the courtroom, and Mr. Fang sentences him to three months of hard labor. The owner of the bookstall rushes in and tells Mr. Fang that two other boys committed the crime. Oliver is cleared of all charges. Pitying the sickly young Oliver, Brownlow takes him into a coach and drives away.  Chapter 12  Oliver is delirious with a fever for days. When he awakes, Brownlow\u2019s kindly housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin, is watching over him. He says that he feels as if his mother has come to sit by him. The story of Oliver\u2019s pitiful life brings tears to Mrs. Bedwin\u2019s eyes. Once Oliver is strong enough to sit up, Mrs. Bedwin carries him downstairs. A portrait of a young woman catches Oliver\u2019s eye and affects him greatly. \tMr. Brownlow drops in to see how Oliver is feeling. Oliver thanks him for his kindness. Brownlow exclaims with astonishment that Oliver closely resembles the young lady in the portrait. Brownlow\u2019s exclamation startles Oliver so much that the boy faints.", "analysis": "Chapters 9\u201312 From today\u2019s perspective, Dickens\u2019s characterization of Fagin through Jewish stereotypes is one of the more uncomfortable aspects of Oliver Twist. Dickens characterizes Fagin as a \u201cvery old shrivelled Jew\u201d with a \u201cvillainous-looking and repulsive face.\u201d Victorians stereotyped the Jews as avaricious gold worshippers, and in accordance with that stereotype, Fagin\u2019s eyes \u201cglisten\u201d as he takes out a \u201cmagnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.\u201d True to the anti-Semitic stereotype, his wealth is ill-gotten\u2014Fagin obtains it by having others do the thieving for him, and some of those others have even been hanged for doing Fagin\u2019s bidding. Dickens\u2019s narrator continually refers to him as \u201cthe Jew\u201d or \u201cthe old Jew,\u201d seemingly making Fagin into a representative for all Jews. When a Jewish acquaintance later took Dickens to task for his portrait of Fagin, Dickens responded that it reflected nothing other than the fact that a sizable number of the leaders of London thieving rings at the time were Jewish. Despite this answer, it is difficult to accept that his portrayal of Fagin does not involve a certain degree of bigotry. \t Fagin also represents a harsh parody of the Protestant work ethic. Oliver is \u201canxious to be actively employed\u201d because he notices that Fagin\u2019s \u201cstern morality\u201d manifests itself when Charley and the Dodger return home empty-handed. Fagin rails about the \u201cmisery of idle and lazy habits\u201d and punishes them by denying them dinner. Victorians castigated the poor for laziness, but the work ethic they preached was in some ways responsible for creating the perversion of that ethic that Fagin represents. As a result of the \u201cstern morality\u201d of charitable institutions, paupers have to choose between the harsh conditions of the workhouses and the harsh conditions of the streets. Because begging is a punishable offense, those who stay outside the workhouses are often forced to turn to crime in order to survive. \tOliver\u2019s experience in the courtroom highlights the precarious position of the poor in the eyes of the law. Mr. Fang is an aptly named representative of the English legal system. The law has fangs ready to devour any unfortunate pauper brought to face \u201cjustice.\u201d Without hard evidence or witnesses, and despite Brownlow\u2019s testimony that he does not believe that Oliver is the thief, Mr. Fang convicts Oliver and sentences him to three months of hard labor. In Oliver\u2019s weakened condition, the sentence is really a sentence of death.<PARAGRAPH>Oliver\u2019s inability to speak at his trial, caused by his exhaustion and sickness, metaphorically suggests the lower class\u2019s lack of political power and ability to voice its own concerns in a public forum. In 1830s England, the right to vote was based on wealth, so the poor had no say with respect to the law. Moreover, the upper classes project their own conceptions of the poor upon them\u2014to the point of blithely redefining poor people\u2019s identities with no regard for the truth. Oliver cannot even say his name due to exhaustion and terror, so a court officer gives him the false name of \u201cTom White.\u201d This process of inaccurate renaming occurs throughout the hearing, as Oliver is falsely named a \u201cyoung vagabond\u201d and a \u201chardened scoundrel\u201d before he is eventually falsely declared \u201cguilty.\u201d But the name \u201cOliver Twist\u201d is, in fact, no more authentic, as Mr. Bumble invents this name when Oliver is born. As these examples demonstrate, Oliver\u2019s identity has been determined by other, more powerful people throughout his life. \tOliver enters a new world when Brownlow takes him home. The English legal system and the workhouses represent a value system based on retribution, punishment, and strict morals. The Brownlow household, in contrast, operates on a basis of forgiveness and kindness. After a life of false names and false identities imposed by others, Oliver comes into contact with a portrait of a woman he closely resembles. With this event, the novel\u2019s central mystery\u2014Oliver\u2019s true identity\u2014is established. In contrast to the courtroom, where a multiplicity of incorrect identities are forced upon Oliver, in the Brownlow home, Oliver\u2019s resemblance to the woman\u2019s portrait suggests the elusive nature of his true identity.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126043207/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oliver/section3/"}
