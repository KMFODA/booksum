{"name": "Act IV, scenes v\u2013vi", "summary": "Act IV, scene v Gertrude and Horatio discuss Ophelia. Gertrude does not wish to see the bereaved girl, but Horatio says that Ophelia should be pitied, explaining that her grief has made her disordered and incoherent. Ophelia enters. Adorned with flowers and singing strange songs, she seems to have gone mad. Claudius enters and hears Ophelia\u2019s ravings, such as, \u201cThey say the owl was a baker\u2019s daughter\u201d (IV.v.42). He says that Ophelia\u2019s grief stems from her father\u2019s death, and that the people have been suspicious and disturbed by the death as well: \u201cmuddied, / Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers / For good Polonius\u2019 death\u201d (IV.v.77\u201379). He also mentions that Laertes has secretly sailed back from France. A loud noise echoes from somewhere in the castle. Claudius calls for his guards, and a gentleman enters to warn the king that Laertes has come with a mob of commoners. The mob calls Laertes \u201clord,\u201d according to the gentlemen, and the people whisper that \u201cLaertes shall be king\u201d (IV.v.102\u2013106). A furious Laertes storms into the hall, fuming in his desire to avenge his father\u2019s death. Claudius attempts to soothe him by frankly acknowledging that Polonius is dead. Gertrude nervously adds that Claudius is innocent in it. When Ophelia reenters, obviously insane, Laertes plunges again into rage. Claudius claims that he is not responsible for Polonius\u2019s death and says that Laertes\u2019 desire for revenge is a credit to him, so long as he seeks revenge upon the proper person. Claudius convinces Laertes to hear his version of events, which he says will answer all his questions. Laertes agrees, and Claudius seconds his desire to achieve justice in the aftermath of Polonius\u2019s death: \u201cWhere th\u2019 offence is, let the great axe fall\u201d (IV.v.213).

In the letter, Hamlet says that his ship was captured by pirates, who have returned him to Denmark. He asks Horatio to escort the sailors to the king and queen, for they have messages for them as well. He also says that he has much to tell of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Horatio takes the sailors to the king and then follows them to find Hamlet, who is in the countryside near the castle. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act IV, scene vi\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act IV, scenes v\u2013vi As we have seen, one of the important themes of Hamlet is the connection between the health of a state and the moral legitimacy of its ruler. Claudius is rotten, and, as a result, Denmark is rotten too. Here, at the beginning of Act IV, scene v, things have palpably darkened for the nation: Hamlet is gone, Polonius is dead and has been buried in secret, Ophelia is raving mad, and, as Claudius tells us, the common people are disturbed and murmuring among themselves. This ominous turn of events leads to the truncated, miniature rebellion that accompanies Laertes\u2019 return to Denmark. Acting as the wronged son operating with open fury, Laertes has all the moral legitimacy that Claudius lacks, the legitimacy that Hamlet has forfeited through his murder of Polonius and his delay in avenging his father\u2019s death. Laertes is Hamlet\u2019s best foil throughout the play, and in this scene the contrast between the two, each of whom has a dead father to avenge, reaches its peak. (A third figure with a dead father to avenge, Fortinbras, lurks on the horizon.) Whereas Hamlet is reflective and has difficulty acting, Laertes is active and has no use for thought. He has no interest in moral concerns, only in his consuming desire to avenge Polonius. When Claudius later asks Laertes how far he would go to avenge his father, Laertes replies that he would slit Hamlet\u2019s throat in the church (IV.vii.98). This statement, indicating his willingness to murder Hamlet even in a sacred place of worship, brings into sharp relief the contrast between the two sons: recall that Hamlet declined to kill Claudius as the king knelt in prayer (III.iii). As befits a scene full of anger and dark thoughts, Act IV, scene v brings a repetition of the motif of insanity, this time through the character of Ophelia, who has truly been driven mad by the death of her father. Shakespeare has demonstrated Ophelia\u2019s chaste dependence on the men in her life; after Polonius\u2019s sudden death and Hamlet\u2019s subsequent exile, she finds herself abruptly without any of them. Ophelia\u2019s lunatic ravings reveal a great deal about the nature of her mind at this stage in her young life. She is obsessed with death, beauty, and an ambiguous sexual desire, expressed in startlingly frank imagery:<PARAGRAPH>Young men will do\u2019t, if they come to\u2019t,By Cock, they are to blame.Quoth she \u2018Before you tumbled me,You promised me to wed.\u2019\t\t(IV.v.59\u201362)  Some readers have interpreted passages such as these, combined with Hamlet\u2019s sexually explicit taunting of Ophelia in Act III, scene ii, as evidence that Ophelia\u2019s relationship with Hamlet was sexual in nature. Of course, this is impossible to conclude with any certainty, but from these lines it is apparent that Ophelia is grappling with sexuality and that her sexual feelings, discouraged by her father, her brother, and her society, are close to the forefront of her mind as she slips into insanity. But, most important, Ophelia\u2019s insanity is designed to contrast strongly with Hamlet\u2019s, differing primarily in its legitimacy: Ophelia does not feign madness to achieve an end, but is truly driven mad by external pressures. Many of the worst elements in Denmark, including madness, fear, and rebellion, so far have been kept hidden under various disguises, such as Hamlet\u2019s pretense and Claudius\u2019s court revelry, and are now beginning to emerge into the open. After exiling Hamlet to England in Act IV, scene iv, Shakespeare now returns him to Denmark only two scenes later through the bizarre deus ex machina\u2014an improbable or unexpected device or character introduced to resolve a situation in a work of fiction or drama\u2014of the pirate attack. The short Act IV, scene vi is primarily devoted to plot development, as Horatio reads Hamlet\u2019s letter narrating his adventure. The story of the pirate attack has little to do with the main themes of the play, but it does provide an interesting variation on the idea of retributive justice, since instead of punishing someone for doing something wrong, Hamlet states his intention to reward the pirates for the right they have done in returning him to Denmark. \u201cThey have dealt with me like thieves of mercy,\u201d he says, \u201cbut they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for them\u201d (IV.vi.17\u201319). Additionally, Hamlet\u2019s letter features a return of the motif of ears and hearing, as the prince tells Horatio that \u201cI have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb,\u201d an open reference to the poison poured into King Hamlet\u2019s ear by the murderous Claudius (IV.vi.21).", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210224223329/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/hamlet/section12/"}
