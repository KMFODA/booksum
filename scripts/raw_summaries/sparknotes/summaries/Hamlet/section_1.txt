{"name": "Act I, scene ii", "summary": "Act I, scene ii The morning after Horatio and the guardsmen see the ghost, King Claudius gives a speech to his courtiers, explaining his recent marriage to Gertrude, his brother\u2019s widow and the mother of Prince Hamlet. Claudius says that he mourns his brother but has chosen to balance Denmark\u2019s mourning with the delight of his marriage. He mentions that young Fortinbras has written to him, rashly demanding the surrender of the lands King Hamlet won from Fortinbras\u2019s father, and dispatches Cornelius and Voltimand with a message for the King of Norway, Fortinbras\u2019s elderly uncle. His speech concluded, Claudius turns to Laertes, the son of the Lord Chamberlain, Polonius. Laertes expresses his desire to return to France, where he was staying before his return to Denmark for Claudius\u2019s coronation. Polonius gives his son permission, and Claudius jovially grants Laertes his consent as well. Turning to Prince Hamlet, Claudius asks why \u201cthe clouds still hang\u201d upon him, as Hamlet is still wearing black mourning clothes (I.ii.66). Gertrude urges him to cast off his \u201cnightly colour,\u201d but he replies bitterly that his inner sorrow is so great that his dour appearance is merely a poor mirror of it (I.ii.68). Affecting a tone of fatherly advice, Claudius declares that all fathers die, and all sons must lose their fathers. When a son loses a father, he is duty-bound to mourn, but to mourn for too long is unmanly and inappropriate. Claudius urges Hamlet to think of him as a father, reminding the prince that he stands in line to succeed to the throne upon Claudius\u2019s death. With this in mind, Claudius says that he does not wish for Hamlet to return to school at Wittenberg (where he had been studying before his father\u2019s death), as Hamlet has asked to do. Gertrude echoes her husband, professing a desire for Hamlet to remain close to her. Hamlet stiffly agrees to obey her. Claudius claims to be so pleased by Hamlet\u2019s decision to stay that he will celebrate with festivities and cannon fire, an old custom called \u201cthe king\u2019s rouse.\u201d Ordering Gertrude to follow him, he escorts her from the room, and the court follows. Alone, Hamlet exclaims that he wishes he could die, that he could evaporate and cease to exist. He wishes bitterly that God had not made suicide a sin. Anguished, he laments his father\u2019s death and his mother\u2019s hasty marriage to his uncle. He remembers how deeply in love his parents seemed, and he curses the thought that now, not yet two month after his father\u2019s death, his mother has married his father\u2019s far inferior brother.<PARAGRAPH>O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason,Would have mourn\u2019d longer,\u2014married with mine uncle,My father\u2019s brother; but no more like my fatherThan I to Hercules: within a month;Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tearsHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,She married:\u2014 O, most wicked speed, to postWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!  See Important Quotations Explained  Hamlet quiets suddenly as Horatio strides into the room, followed by Marcellus and Bernardo. Horatio was a close friend of Hamlet at the university in Wittenberg, and Hamlet, happy to see him, asks why he has left the school to travel to Denmark. Horatio says that he came to see King Hamlet\u2019s funeral, to which Hamlet curtly replies that Horatio came to see his mother\u2019s wedding. Horatio agrees that the one followed closely on the heels of the other. He then tells Hamlet that he, Marcellus, and Bernardo have seen what appears to be his father\u2019s ghost. Stunned, Hamlet agrees to keep watch with them that night, in the hope that he will be able to speak to the apparition. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act I, scene ii\u00a0\u2192 Analysis Having established a dark, ghostly atmosphere in the first scene, Shakespeare devotes the second to the seemingly jovial court of the recently crowned King Claudius. If the area outside the castle is murky with the aura of dread and anxiety, the rooms inside the castle are devoted to an energetic attempt to banish that aura, as the king, the queen, and the courtiers desperately pretend that nothing is out of the ordinary. It is difficult to imagine a more convoluted family dynamic or a more out-of-balance political situation, but Claudius nevertheless preaches an ethic of balance to his courtiers, pledging to sustain and combine the sorrow he feels for the king\u2019s death and the joy he feels for his wedding in equal parts. But despite Claudius\u2019s efforts, the merriment of the court seems superficial. This is largely due to the fact that the idea of balance Claudius pledges to follow is unnatural. How is it possible to balance sorrow for a brother\u2019s death with happiness for having married a dead brother\u2019s wife? Claudius\u2019s speech is full of contradictory words, ideas, and phrases, beginning with \u201cThough yet of Hamlet our late brother\u2019s death / The memory be green,\u201d which combines the idea of death and decay with the idea of greenery, growth, and renewal (I.ii.1\u20132). He also speaks of \u201c[o]ur sometime sister, now our queen,\u201d \u201cdefeated joy,\u201d \u201can auspicious and a dropping eye,\u201d \u201cmirth in funeral,\u201d and \u201cdirge in marriage\u201d (I.ii.8\u201312). These ideas sit uneasily with one another, and Shakespeare uses this speech to give his audience an uncomfortable first impression of Claudius. The negative impression is furthered when Claudius affects a fatherly role toward the bereaved Hamlet, advising him to stop grieving for his dead father and adapt to a new life in Denmark. Hamlet obviously does not want Claudius\u2019s advice, and Claudius\u2019s motives in giving it are thoroughly suspect, since, after all, Hamlet is the man who would have inherited the throne had Claudius not snatched it from him. The result of all this blatant dishonesty is that this scene portrays as dire a situation in Denmark as the first scene does. Where the first scene illustrated the fear and supernatural danger lurking in Denmark, the second hints at the corruption and weakness of the king and his court. The scene also furthers the idea that Denmark is somehow unsound as a nation, as Claudius declares that Fortinbras makes his battle plans \u201c[h]olding a weak supposal of our worth, / Or thinking by our late dear brother\u2019s death / Our state to be disjoint and out of frame\u201d (I.ii.18\u201320). Prince Hamlet, devastated by his father\u2019s death and betrayed by his mother\u2019s marriage, is introduced as the only character who is unwilling to play along with Claudius\u2019s gaudy attempt to mimic a healthy royal court. On the one hand, this may suggest that he is the only honest character in the royal court, the only person of high standing whose sensibilities are offended by what has happened in the aftermath of his father\u2019s death. On the other hand, it suggests that he is a malcontent, someone who refuses to go along with the rest of the court for the sake of the greater good of stability. In any case, Hamlet already feels, as Marcellus will say later, that \u201c[s]omething is rotten in the state of Denmark\u201d (I.iv.67). We also see that his mother\u2019s hasty remarriage has shattered his opinion of womanhood (\u201cFrailty, thy name is woman,\u201d he cries out famously in this scene [I.ii.146]), a motif that will develop through his unraveling romantic relationship with Ophelia and his deteriorating relationship with his mother. His soliloquy about suicide (\u201cO, that this too too solid flesh would melt, / Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!\u201d [I.ii.129\u2013130]) ushers in what will be a central idea in the play. The world is painful to live in, but, within the Christian framework of the play, if one commits suicide to end that pain, one damns oneself to eternal suffering in hell. The question of the moral validity of suicide in an unbearably painful world will haunt the rest of the play; it reaches the height of its urgency in the most famous line in all of English literature: \u201cTo be, or not to be: that is the question\u201d (III.i.58). In this scene Hamlet mainly focuses on the appalling conditions of life, railing against Claudius\u2019s court as \u201can unweeded garden, / That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature / Possess it merely\u201d (I.ii.135\u2013137). Throughout the play, we watch the gradual crumbling of the beliefs on which Hamlet\u2019s worldview has been based. Already, in this first soliloquy, religion has failed him, and his warped family situation can offer him no solace.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210224223329/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/hamlet/section2/"}
