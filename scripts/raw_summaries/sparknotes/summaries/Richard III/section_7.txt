{"name": "Act III, scenes ii\u2013iv", "summary": "Act III, scene ii  Very early in the morning, a messenger knocks at the door of Lord Hastings, sent by Hastings\u2019s friend Lord Stanley. The messenger tells Hastings that Stanley has learned about the \u201cdivided counsels\u201d that Richard plans to hold this day (III.i.176). The previous night, the messenger says, Stanley had a nightmare in which a boar attacked and killed him. The boar is Richard\u2019s heraldic symbol, and according to the messenger, Stanley is afraid for his safety and that of Hastings. He urges Hastings to take to horseback and flee with him before the sun rises, heading away from Richard and toward safety. \tHastings dismisses Stanley\u2019s fears and tells the messenger to assure Stanley that there is nothing to fear. Catesby arrives at Hastings\u2019s house. He has been sent by Richard to discover Hastings\u2019s feelings about Richard\u2019s scheme to rise to power. But when Catesby brings up the idea that Richard should take the crown instead of Prince Edward, Hastings recoils in horror. Seeing that Hastings will not change his mind, Catesby seems to drop the issue. \tStanley arrives, complaining of his forebodings, but Hastings cheerfully reassures him of their safety. Finally, Hastings goes off to the council meeting along with Buckingham. Ironically, Hastings is celebrating the news that Elizabeth\u2019s kinsmen will be executed, thinking that he and his friend Stanley are safe in the favor of Richard and Buckingham. Hastings is blissfully unaware of Richard\u2019s plan to decapitate him should Hastings refuse to join Richard\u2019s side.

Rivers laments their impending execution. He tells Ratcliffe that they are being killed for nothing but their loyalty, and that their killers will eventually pay for their crimes. Gray, remembering Margaret\u2019s curse, says that it has finally descended upon them, and that the fate that awaits them is their punishment for their original complicity in the Yorkists\u2019 murder of Henry VI and his son. Rivers reminds Gray that Margaret also cursed Richard and his allies. He prays for God to remember these curses but to forgive the one Margaret pronounced against Elizabeth herself, and her two young sons, the princes. The three embrace and prepare for their deaths. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene iii\u00a0\u2192  Act III, scene iv  At Richard\u2019s Council session in the Tower of London, the suspicious Hastings asks the councilors about the cause of their meeting. He says that the meeting\u2019s purpose is supposed to be to discuss the date on which Prince Edward should be crowned king, and Derby affirms that this is indeed the purpose of the meeting. Richard arrives, smiling and pleasant, and asks the Bishop of Ely to send for a bowl of strawberries. But Buckingham takes Richard aside to tell him what Catesby has learned\u2014that Hastings is loyal to the young princes and is unlikely to go along with Richard\u2019s plans to seize power. \tWhen Richard re-enters the council room, he has changed his tune entirely. Pretending to be enraged, he displays his arm\u2014which, as everyone knows, has been deformed since his birth\u2014and says that Queen Elizabeth, conspiring with Hastings\u2019s mistress Shore, must have cast a spell on him to cause its withering. When Hastings hesitates before accepting this speculation as fact, Richard promptly accuses Hastings of treachery, orders his execution, and tells his men that he will not eat until he has been presented with Hastings\u2019s head. Left alone with his executioners, the stunned Hastings slowly realizes that Stanley was right all along. Richard is a manipulative, power-hungry traitor, and Hastings has been dangerously overconfident. Realizing that nothing can now save England from Richard\u2019s rapacious desire for power, he too cries out despairingly that Margaret\u2019s curse has finally struck home.<PARAGRAPH>Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene iv\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act III, scenes ii\u2013iv Stanley\u2019s dream of the boar is the latest of many supernatural signs and omens in the play. Given what we know about Richard, Hastings obviously would have been wise to pay attention to this omen. Instead, he dismisses it, due to his supposedly rational skepticism. \u201cI wonder he\u2019s so simple, / To trust the mock\u2019ry of unquiet slumbers,\u201d he says genially of Stanley (III.ii.23\u201324). Another factor in Hastings\u2019s easy dismissal of the dream, however, is his own inflated ego, which leads him to be overconfident and complacent. He believes that he and Richard are \u201cat the one\u201d in terms of their plans, and that his close friend Catesby will tell him everything that goes on in the second council (III.ii.10). He also makes one of the most egregiously incorrect statements about Richard in the play, indicating the depth of Richard\u2019s skill at deception: \u201cI think there\u2019s never a man in Christendom / Can lesser hide his love or hate than he, / For by his face straight shall you know his heart\u201d (III.iv.51\u201353). \tClearly, Hastings makes the wrong decision here, and when he realizes his doom in Act III, scene iv, he thinks back to previous omens. Stanley dreams not only that the boar destroys him, but also that Hastings\u2019s own horse stumbles three times on the way to the council \u201c[a]s loath to bear me to the slaughter-house\u201d (III.iv.86). \u201cO Margaret, Margaret! Now thy heavy curse / Is lighted on poor Hastings\u2019 wretched head,\u201d he says (III.iv.92\u201393). We can interpret Hastings\u2019s fate as Shakespeare\u2019s statement that people ought to pay attention to the omens of their dreams, but we can just as easily read it as a warning against overconfidence. Hastings now regrets his earlier bragging about his enemies\u2019 execution at Pomfret, imagining \u201cmyself secure in grace and favor\u201d (III.iv.91). Furthermore, he realizes that, if he had wised up to Richard earlier, he could have avoided his fate and perhaps even saved England from what Richard plans to visit upon it. \u201cI, too fond [foolish], might have prevented this,\u201d he laments (III.iv.81). \tHastings also muses before his death on the \u201cmomentary grace of mortal men,\u201d an idea that the play returns to again and again (III.iv.96). The quickness with which people\u2019s fortunes can change was a very popular topic for literature of Shakespeare\u2019s period, and for good reason: in the courts of Renaissance England, a person\u2019s welfare\u2014and his or her life\u2014depended on the whim of the ruler. A shift in political power would regularly cause the downfall and mass execution of dozens of formerly powerful courtiers. Perhaps for this reason, Renaissance court literature exhibits a great fascination with the precariousness of human fortunes. The medieval idea of the Wheel of Fortune, in which those at the top of the wheel are inevitably brought to the bottom, and vice versa, was still very current in Shakespeare\u2019s day. This fatalistic view of human life coexisted with a strict Christian mindset that insisted that worldly belongings would cause corruption and could not buy glory in heaven. All in all, despite the burgeoning wealth and materialism of the Renaissance world, Renaissance people were often in great conflict about the real value and meaning of their money and their luxuries. In the moments before his death, Hastings muses on this theme. He reflects that the person who builds his hopes on material prosperity instead of God\u2019s grace \u201c[l]ives like a drunken sailor on a mast, / Ready with every nod to tumble down / Into the fatal bowels of the deep\u201d (III.iv.99\u2013101). This idea is nowhere better illustrated than in the preceding scene\u2014Act III, scene iii\u2014in which we have a brief last look at Rivers, Gray, and their friend Vaughan before their execution. Hastings earlier rejoices over their downfall, but their execution is as unexpected as his own. Like Hastings, the doomed Woodeville men proclaim their innocence. Like Hastings, they recall Margaret\u2019s curse and foretell dire consequences for England under Richard\u2019s reign. Like Hastings, they predict that their executioners will face retribution for their deeds. \u201cYou live, that shall cry woe for this hereafter\u201d (III.iii.6), says Vaughan to his jailers, and Hastings\u2014in a similar mood\u2014ends his last speech with a chilling couplet: \u201cCome lead me to the block; bear him [Richard] my head.\u00a0/ They smile at me, who shortly shall be dead\u201d (III.iv.106\u2013107).", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227044613/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/richardiii/section8/"}
