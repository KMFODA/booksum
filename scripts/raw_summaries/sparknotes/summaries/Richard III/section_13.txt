{"name": "Act V, scenes vii\u2013viii", "summary": "Act V, scene vii  The two armies fight a pitched battle. Catesby appears on stage and calls to Richard\u2019s ally Norfolk, asking for help for Richard. Catesby reports that the king\u2019s horse has been killed and that the king is fighting like a madman on foot, challenging everyone he sees in the field as he attempts to track down Richmond himself. \tRichard himself now appears, calling out for a horse. But he refuses Catesby\u2019s offer of help, saying that he has prepared himself to face the fortunes of battle and will not run from them now. He also says that Richmond seems to have filled the field with decoys\u2014that is, common soldiers dressed like Richmond\u2014of whom Richard has already killed five. He departs, seeking Richmond.  Act V, scene viii  Finally, Richmond appears, and Richard returns. They face each other at last and fight a bloody duel. Richmond wins, and kills King Richard with his sword. Richmond runs back into battle. The noise of battle dies down, and Richmond returns, accompanied by his noblemen. We learn that Richmond\u2019s side has won the battle. This revelation is hardly surprising, since Richard is dead. Stanley, swearing his loyalty to the new king, presents Richmond with the crown, which has been taken from Richard\u2019s body. Richmond accepts the crown and puts it on. \tRelatively few noblemen have been killed, and Stanley\u2019s young son, George, is still safe. Richmond, now King Henry VII, orders that the bodies of the dead be buried, and that Richard\u2019s soldiers\u2014who have fled the field\u2014should all be given amnesty. He then announces his intention to marry young Elizabeth, daughter of the former Queen Elizabeth and of the late King Edward IV. The houses of Lancaster and York will be united at last, and the long bloodshed will be over. The new king asks for God\u2019s blessing on England and the marriage, and for a lasting peace. The nobles leave the stage.", "analysis": "Act V, scenes vii\u2013viii Richard\u2019s death is conveyed only in stage directions in the text\u2014uncharacteristically, Shakespeare does not even give him a dying speech. Richard\u2019s death comes as no surprise, however. His final scenes only enact the outcome that the play has already established as inevitable, both in terms of narrative shape and in terms of moral resolution. In broad terms, the first part of the play shows a gradual rise in Richard\u2019s fortunes and power. These fortunes peak and then decline dramatically. Buckingham\u2019s hesitation to help Richard kill the young princes in Act IV, scene ii, moments after Richard\u2019s coronation, marks the beginning of Richard\u2019s decline into paranoia and his gradual loss of control of the events around him. The duchess of York\u2019s curses and Elizabeth\u2019s deception of Richard in Act IV, scene\u00a0iv confirm this downward slide, which reaches its low with Richard\u2019s nightmare\u2014and subsequent self-questioning\u2014in Act V, scene v. After all of these events, it is clear that Richard\u2019s death, which has been predicted and prophesied many times by many people, is only a matter of time. Richard\u2019s final scenes do illustrate something of the frenzied selfishness of his mind. Shakespeare depicts the gradual devolution of his bold and reckless fighting on the battlefield, as he goes from fighting to protect his power and his kingdom to fighting simply to protect his neck. Richard lacks the sense of higher purpose with which Richmond has been endowed, and thus he lacks the ability to die nobly. In the end, Richard is obsessed with his own self-preservation, as indicated by his cry of \u201c[a] horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!\u201d (V.vii.7, 13). In this moment, Richard clearly reveals his priorities. He would trade everything for a horse on which to improve his chances of surviving the battle rather than die honorably for his cause.<PARAGRAPH>Richmond\u2019s final speech primarily serves a narrative purpose, showing that Richard, the villain of the play, has been definitively vanquished, although his death has occurred offstage. Richmond\u2019s simple, judgmental declaration that \u201c[T]he bloody dog is dead\u201d indicates the relief and exhaustion that he (and everyone else) feels after Richard\u2019s long campaign of cruelty (V.viii.2). Many dead kings, even wicked ones, are remembered kindly by their enemies after they die, but Richard is so universally hated that he is spoken of merely as a \u201cbloody dog.\u201d Symbolically, then, Richard\u2019s death and Richmond\u2019s ascension to the throne suggest that the conflicts that have plagued England for so long are at an end. \u201cEngland hath long been mad, and scarred herself,\u201d says Richmond, referring to the wars among the royalty (V.viii.23). Richmond\u2019s intention to claim the kingdom\u2019s \u201clong usurp\u00e8d royalty,\u201d as Stanley puts it, heralds the symbolic end not just of the particular conflict with Richard but of the Wars of the Roses in general (V.viii.4). Moreover, with his marriage to young Elizabeth, Richmond will meld the houses of York and Lancaster in a fertile and peaceful union, uniting \u201cthe white rose and the red\u201d\u2014the symbols of the houses of York and Lancaster, respectively (V.viii.19). Richard\u2019s long reign of terror has come to an end as the play closes with the promise of a marriage, and with the new King Henry\u2019s fervent prayer for \u201cthis fair land\u2019s peace\u201d (V.viii.39). The play, then, ends tragically for Richard but happily for England.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227044613/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/richardiii/section14/"}
