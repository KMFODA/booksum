{"name": "Act III, scenes iv\u2013vii", "summary": "Act III, scene iv  Antony complains to Octavia that since departing Rome, Caesar has not only waged war against Pompey but has also belittled Antony in public. Octavia urges Antony not to believe everything he hears, and she pleads with him to keep the peace with her brother. Were Antony and Caesar to fight, Octavia laments, she would not know whether to support her brother or her husband. Antony tells her that he must do what needs to be done to preserve his honor, without which he would be nothing. Nevertheless, he sends her to Rome to make peace again between Caesar and himself. Meanwhile, he prepares for war against Pompey. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene iv\u00a0\u2192  Act III, scene v  Enobarbus converses with Eros, another friend of Antony. The two discuss Caesar\u2019s defeat of Pompey\u2019s army and the murder of Pompey. Eros reports that Caesar made use of Lepidus\u2019s forces, but then, after their victory, denied Lepidus his share of the spoils. In fact, Caesar has accused the triumvir of plotting against him and has thrown him into prison. Enobarbus reports that Antony\u2019s navy is ready to sail for Italy and Caesar. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene v\u00a0\u2192  Act III, scene vi  Back in Rome, Caesar rails against Antony. He tells Agrippa and Maecenas that Antony has gone to Egypt to sit alongside Cleopatra as her king. He has given her rule over much of the Middle East, making her absolute queen of lower Syria, Cyprus, and Lydia. Caesar reports that Antony is displeased that he has not yet been allotted a fair portion of the lands that Caesar wrested from Pompey and Lepidus. He will divide his lot, he says, if Antony responds in kind and grants him part of Armenia and other kingdoms that Antony conquered. No sooner does Maecenas predict that Antony will never concede to those terms than Octavia enters. Caesar laments that the woman travels so plainly, without the fanfare that should attend the wife of Antony. Caesar reveals to her that Antony has joined Cleopatra in Egypt, where he has assembled a large alliance to fight Rome. Octavia is heartbroken, and Maecenas assures her that she has the sympathy of every Roman citizen.

Enobarbus tries to dissuade her, but she dismisses his objections. Antony tells his general, Camidius, that he will meet Caesar at sea. Camidius and Enobarbus object, pointing out that while they have superiority on land, Caesar\u2019s naval fleet is much stronger. -Antony, however, refuses to listen. Cleopatra maintains that her fleet of sixty ships will win the battle. Antony leaves to prepare the navy, despite the protests of a soldier who begs him to forgo a doomed sea battle and advocates fighting on foot. After the general and the queen exit, Camidius complains that they are all \u201cwomen\u2019s men,\u201d ruled by Cleopatra (III.vii.70). He comments on the speed of Caesar\u2019s approach, then goes to prepare the land defenses. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene vii\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act III, scenes iv\u2013vii Caesar\u2019s description of Antony and Cleopatra in Act III, scene vi shows the play\u2019s preoccupation with the sexualized East. The scene recalls an earlier speech by Enobarbus in which he states that the Egyptian queen floats down the Nile on a glittering throne. Just as Cleopatra and her barge are a vision of decadent beauty in the earlier speech, so is the image of the queen and her lover in the marketplace of Alexandria. Caesar\u2019s exchange with Maecenas underscores the spectacular nature of Antony and Cleopatra\u2019s appearance:  CAESAR:\tContemning Rome, he has done all this and more\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Alexandria. Here\u2019s the manner of\u2019t:\t\t\t\tI\u2019 th\u2019 market place on a tribunal silvered,\t\tCleopatra and himself in chairs of gold\t\tWere publicly enthroned. . . . MAECENAs:\tThis in the public eye? CAESAR:\tI\u2019 th\u2019 common showplace, where they exercise.\t\t. . . \t\t\t\tShe\t\tIn th\u2019habiliments of the goddess Isis\t\tThat day appeared, and oft before gave audience\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(III.vi.2\u201319)   Antony and Cleopatra draws distinctions between the West and the East by illustrating the West as sober, military, and masculine, and the East as exotic, pleasure-loving, and sexual. In this scene, it is not only the public appearance of Antony with a woman not his wife that shocks Maecenas, Caesar, and Agrippa, but also the decadence with which they appear. While the military men confer in the West regarding the machinations of war, Antony\u2019s life in the East is represented as focused on sensual pleasures, both with Cleopatra and within the wealth and splendor of her kingdom.<PARAGRAPH>This passage also confirms Cleopatra\u2019s theatricality and the world\u2019s preoccupation with spectacle. Spectacle is of supreme importance throughout the play, as Caesar again makes clear when he complains to Octavia about her lack of it. Bent on keeping the peace between her husband and brother, Octavia arrives in Rome without any of the fanfare or trappings that would indicate her station. Caesar insists that the  \twife of AntonyShould have an army for an usher, andThe neighs of horse to tell of her approachLong ere she did appear.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(III.vi.43\u201346)  Caesar likens Octavia\u2019s appearance to that of a common maid going to market. Caesar links spectacle with power: the greater the display, the more substantial and genuine the power behind it. Caesar returns to this line of thinking at the play\u2019s end when he plans to display Cleopatra on the streets of Rome as a testament to the indomitable strength of his empire. Here we see the equation between spectacle and power in reverse: Octavia\u2019s unheralded arrival in Rome betrays what Caesar knows too well\u2014his sister has little, if any, power over a husband whose heart visibly belongs to Egypt. The romance between Antony and Cleopatra is different from the romance between some of Shakespeare\u2019s other major characters because it focuses on how the two mesh with larger historical and social dramas. Whereas Romeo and Juliet, for instance, largely chronicles the private moments of its teenaged protagonists, following the couple as they steal moments together at a crowded party or on a moonlit balcony, Antony and Cleopatra\u2019s concerns are public rather than private. Antony\u2019s return to and reconciliation with Cleopatra take place offstage, as do all of the more private moments of their relationship. What earns stage time in this play are not the muted whispers of discreet lovers but the grand performances of lovers who live in, and play for, the public eye. Love, in Antony and Cleopatra, seems less a product of the bedroom than of political alliance, for we are always aware of the public consequences of the couple\u2019s affair. When Caesar laments that Antony has given up his empire for a whore, we understand the enormous impact\u2014both civic and geographic\u2014that the lovers\u2019 affair will have on the world. Kingdoms stand to be built on the foundation of Antony and Cleopatra\u2019s love or crumble under its weight.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126032913/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/antony/section5/"}
