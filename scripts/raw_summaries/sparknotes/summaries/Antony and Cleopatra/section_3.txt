{"name": "Act II, scene vii; Act III, scenes i\u2013iii", "summary": "Most noble Antony,Let not the piece of virtue which is setBetwixt us as the cement of our loveTo keep it builded, be the ram to batterThe fortress of it. . . . See Important Quotations Explained   Act II, scene vii  A group of servants discusses Pompey\u2019s dinner party, commenting on Lepidus\u2019s drunkenness in particular. Pompey enters with his guests as Antony discusses the Nile River. Lepidus babbles on about crocodiles, which, according to popular belief, formed spontaneously out of the river mud. Lepidus asks Antony to describe the crocodile, and Antony responds with a humorously circular and meaningless definition: \u201cIt is shaped, sir, like itself, and is as broad as it hath breadth\u201d (II.vii.39\u201340). Menas pulls Pompey aside to suggest that they set sail and kill the three triumvirs while they are still drunk and onboard the boat, thus delivering control of the Western world into Pompey\u2019s hands. Pompey rails against Menas for sharing this plan with him. Were the deed done without his knowledge, Pompey says, he would have praised it, but now that he knows, it would violate his honor. In an angry aside, Menas expresses his disappointment with Pompey and swears that he will leave his master\u2019s service. Meanwhile, the triumvirs and their host continue their drunken revelry, eventually joining hands, dancing, and singing before they leave the ship and stumble off to bed.

One of Ventidius\u2019s soldiers urges him to push on into Parthia and win more glory, but Ventidius says he should not. If he were too successful in war, he explains, he would fall out of Antony\u2019s favor and not be able to advance as a member of Antony\u2019s forces. Instead, Ventidius halts his army and writes to Antony, informing him of his victory. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene i\u00a0\u2192  Act III, scene ii  Agrippa and Enobarbus discuss the current state of affairs: Pompey has gone, Octavia and Caesar are saddened by their nearing separation, and Lepidus is still sick from his night of heavy drinking. Agrippa and Enobarbus mock Lepidus, the weakest of the three triumvirs, who trips over himself in order to stay on good terms with both Antony and Caesar. A trumpet blares, and Lepidus, Antony, and Caesar enter. Caesar bids farewell to Antony and his sister, urging his new brother-in-law never to mistreat Octavia and thereby drive a wedge between himself and Antony. Antony implores Caesar not to offend him, making assurances that he will not justify Caesar\u2019s fears. Antony and Octavia depart, leaving Lepidus and Caesar in Rome.

He tells Cleopatra that Octavia is shorter than she and that Octavia has a low voice and is rather lifeless. This news pleases Cleopatra, who delights in thinking that Antony\u2019s bride is stupid and short. She decides that, given Octavia\u2019s lack of positive attributes, Antony cannot possibly enjoy being with her for long. She promises to reward the messenger for his good service, showers him with gold, and asks him not to think of her too harshly for her past treatment of him. She then tells Charmian that Antony will almost certainly return to her. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene iii\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act II, scene vii; Act III, scenes i\u2013iii Both Ventidius\u2019s speech after the victory over Parthia and the events of the party challenge and complicate our understanding of honor. Ventidius\u2019s contemplation of his performance in battle in Act II, scene i offers a definition of honor based on prowess in battle. Ventidius explains that it would not be honorable to conquer too extensively, since eclipsing his captain\u2019s fame would reflect poorly on himself. Whereas Pompey\u2019s definition of honor has to do with appearance, Ventidius\u2019s has to do with ambition. Ultimately, it is clear that Ventidius contemplates his honorable leading of the army as a way of achieving greater status; he ends his speech describing the perils of overachievement with the words, \u201cI could do more to do Antonius good, / But \u2019twould offend him, and in his offence / Should my performance perish\u201d (III.i.25\u201327). Ventidius seems to care at least as much about Antony\u2019s opinion of his performance in war as about his sense of honor. Pompey\u2019s sense of honor, however, is based on surface appearances. His desire that the triumvirate be deposed might easily be seen as dishonorable, since he appears to be making peace with them. However, he believes that he retains his honor by not acting on his dishonorable feelings. When Menas suggests that he be allowed to assassinate the triumvirs in order to deliver world power into Pompey\u2019s hands, Pompey\u2019s reasoning for condemning Menas\u2019s plan shows that it is not the act itself that would challenge Pompey\u2019s public honor, but rather its appearance:<PARAGRAPH>Ah, this thou shouldst have doneAnd not have spoke on\u2019t. In me \u2018tis villainy,In thee \u2018t had been good service. Thou must know\u2018Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;Mine honour it. Repent that e\u2019er thy tongueHath so betrayed thine act. Being done unknown,I should have found it afterwards well done, But must condemn it now.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(II.vii.70\u201377)  Pompey does not condemn the assassination of his unsuspecting\u2014indeed, helplessly drunken\u2014guests as treacherous or morally irresponsible. Instead, he complains that Menas shared the plan with him, a divulgence that, if discovered, would affect the way that the world sees him. Pompey would no longer be looked upon as an honorable man if he murdered his guests. In a play that invests so much in surface, even qualities such as honor and nobility have more to do with spectacle than with deeper human emotions. Lepidus\u2019s drunkenness symbolizes his physical and political weakness: indeed, he makes only one more appearance before being eliminated by Caesar, fulfilling the servants\u2019 prophesy that even world leaders can be easily overthrown. That Caesar proves the wind that blows Lepidus (and eventually Antony) down should not come as any surprise, given his behavior aboard Pompey\u2019s ship. Caesar alone manages to elevate duty above pleasure; he alone interrupts the night\u2019s carousing to remind Antony that their more serious business conflicts with the extended revelry. Perhaps the most telling phrase Antony utters in this scene comes as he tries to persuade Caesar to forget duty for the night. While urging his men to drink until \u201cthe conquering wine hath steeped our sense / In soft and delicate Lethe,\u201d he bids Caesar to \u201c[b]e a child o\u2019th\u2019 time\u201d\u2014to live, in other words, strictly for the moment, for the pleasure of the present (II.vii.94\u2013103). Antony\u2019s propensity to live according to the moment, with little regard for the future or the consequences of his actions, is one of the greatest factors in his demise.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126032913/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/antony/section4/"}
