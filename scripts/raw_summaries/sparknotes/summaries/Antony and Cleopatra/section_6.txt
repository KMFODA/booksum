Maecenas counsels him to take advantage of Antony\u2019s rage, for \u201c[n]ever anger / Made good guard for itself\u201d (IV.i.9\u201310).

Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act IV, scene i\u00a0\u2192  Act IV, scene ii  Enobarbus brings word to Antony that Caesar has refused to fight him. Antony asks why, and Enobarbus suggests that Caesar is so sure of success that one-on-one combat seems unfair. Antony declares that he will fight the next day, whether it brings him victory or death. He thanks his servants for their faithful service and warns them that this night might be his last night with them. They begin to weep, and Enobarbus, with tears in his eyes, rebukes Antony for such a morbid speech. Antony says that he did not mean to cause sorrow, and, as he leads them off toward a bountiful feast, urges them to enjoy their evening together.

Antony feels confident about the coming fight, promising Cleopatra that anyone who attempts to undo his armor before he is ready to remove it and rest will confront his rage.

A soldier comments that had he done so, he would still count Enobarbus as an ally. This report is the first Antony has heard of his most trusted friend\u2019s desertion, and the news shocks him. At first he does not believe it, but Eros then points to the \u201cchests and treasure\u201d Enobarbus left behind (IV.v.10). Antony orders soldiers to deliver Enobarbus\u2019s possessions to him, along with \u201cgentle adieus and greetings,\u201d and laments that his \u201cfortunes have / Corrupted honest men\u201d  (IV.v.14\u201317).

Caesar orders that the front lines be fitted with soldiers who have deserted Antony, so that Antony will feel like he that he is wasting his efforts fighting himself.

Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act IV, scene viii\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act IV, scenes i\u2013viii Because the play\u2019s dramatic structure suggests that the battle in Act\u00a0IV will be climactic and probably result in Antony\u2019s death, Antony\u2019s victory in these scenes is surprising and makes the plot much less predictable. After Antony\u2019s flight from battle in Act III, and after Cleopatra\u2019s apparent willingness to betray her lover, all seems lost for the lovers. Indeed, the opening scenes of Act IV confirm and build upon this impression. Caesar rejects Antony\u2019s proposal for hand-to-hand combat with such assurance that we feel that there is something prophetic in the line \u201cKnow that tomorrow the last of many battles / We mean to fight\u201d (IV.i.11\u201312). Antony, seemingly undone by the treachery of his own behavior, manages to burden his men with sadness rather than rouse them for battle, while several soldiers hear an otherworldly music they believe portends the destruction of the once great general and his forces. Not only do these scenes redirect our expectations, they also suggest different interpretations of Antony\u2019s and Cleopatra\u2019s characters. Up to this point in the play, the two lovers seem to have been so absorbed in their own romance that they have allowed nations to go to war. A decidedly Roman perspective has dominated the presentation of Cleopatra as a wanton gypsy and Antony as her fool. The day of battle, however, brings victory to Antony and, at least for a moment, restores him to good fortune. Fighting a vicious and bloody fight, Antony displays the martial abilities that have forged his reputation, and he wins the battle. In these scenes both Antony and Cleopatra display depths of character that cannot be reduced to the respective fool and strumpet. The boldest, most incontrovertible display of the honor for which Antony is famed comes not in battle but in his decision to return to Enobarbus his abandoned treasures. Enobarbus\u2019s defection to Caesar\u2019s side underscores one of the play\u2019s main concerns: the mutability of human character. Once one of Antony\u2019s most confident and self-assured comrades, Enobarbus becomes a man ruined by guilt over his disloyalty. The completeness of his change of heart is called into question, however, when he declares that he will go off to die in a ditch, because the latter part of his life has been foul. Although he has changed sides, he refuses to fight against Antony. Enobarbus lacks the distance necessary to see his life as a whole, and to understand the honorability of his past actions. He concentrates only on recent dishonorable actions, and so determines to die. But our understanding of Enobarbus must incorporate his former and present selves, the best and the foulest.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126032913/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/antony/section7/"}
