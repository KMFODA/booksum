Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene viii\u00a0\u2192  Act III, scene ix  Antony instructs Enobarbus to set their squadrons on a hillside, which will allow them to view the battle at sea. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene ix\u00a0\u2192  Act III, scene x  Enobarbus describes the sea fight he has just witnessed: Antony\u2019s forces were winning the battle until Cleopatra\u2019s ship fled without warning and Antony followed her. The fleet was thrown into confusion, and the victory went to Caesar. Antony\u2019s soldiers are sickened by the sight, one of them declaring that he has never seen anything so shameful. Camidius defects to Caesar\u2019s side, bringing his army and following the lead of six of Antony\u2019s royal allies, but Enobarbus, against his better judgment, remains loyal to his general. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene x\u00a0\u2192  Act III, scene xi  Deeply ashamed of his performance in battle, Antony berates himself, ordering his servants to leave the service of such an unworthy master. He urges them to abandon Antony as Antony has abandoned his nobler self. When Cleopatra enters, she finds her lover distraught and alone. She tries to comfort him, but Antony can remind her only of his valiant past: it was he who won fierce battles, who dealt with the treacheries of Cassius and Brutus. But now, he determines, such events do not matter. He asks Cleopatra why she has led him into infamy, and she begs his forgiveness, saying that she never dreamed that he would follow her retreat. He asks her how she could doubt that he would follow her, when his heart was tied to her rudder. Antony complains that he must now seek young Caesar\u2019s pardon, but unable to bear the sight of the queen\u2019s sorrow, he forgives her. As Antony kisses Cleopatra, he remarks that even her mere kiss repays him for his shame. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene xi\u00a0\u2192  Act III, scene xii  Caesar is with Dolabella and Thidias, two of his supporters, when Antony\u2019s ambassador arrives with his master\u2019s request: Antony asks to be allowed to live in Egypt or, barring that, to \u201cbreathe between the heavens and earth, / A private man in Athens\u201d (III.xii.14\u201315). The ambassador further delivers Cleopatra\u2019s request that Egypt be passed on to her heirs. Caesar dismisses Antony\u2019s requests but declares that Cleopatra will have a fair hearing so long as she expels Antony from Egypt or executes him. He sends Thidias to lure Cleopatra to accept these terms, hoping that she will betray her lover. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene xii\u00a0\u2192  Act III, scene xiii  Enobarbus tells Cleopatra that the defeat was not her fault since Antony could have chosen to follow reason rather than lust. The ambassador returns with Caesar\u2019s message: Antony declares that he will challenge his rival to one-on-one combat. Enobarbus meditates on such a course of action, but decides that if he remains loyal to Antony he might be able to attack Caesar, if Caesar kills Antony. Meanwhile, Thidias arrives to tell Cleopatra that Caesar will show her mercy if she will relinquish Antony. The queen concedes that she embraced Antony more out of fear than love and declares Caesar a god to whom she will bow down. Just then, Antony enters in a fury and demands that Thidias be whipped. He then turns to Cleopatra and rails at her for betraying him. The queen protests that she would never betray him, which satisfies Antony. Antony\u2019s fleet has reassembled, and much of his land forces remain intact, ready to attack Caesar again. Enobarbus, who has observed this scene, decides that he has been faithful to Antony long enough. He feels that Antony\u2019s mind is slipping and that he must abandon his master.<PARAGRAPH>Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act III, scene xiii\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act III, scenes viii\u2013xiii Act III, scenes viii\u2013x show that narrative time and chronological time occur at much different paces in Antony and Cleopatra. In the space of three scenes, we witness the full battle of Actium. We see Caesar, then Antony, prepare for battle and know the outcome of their meeting within the first four lines of Act III, scene x. In other sections of the play, the same number of scenes conveys less information and covers much less time. The rapid progression of these scenes attests to the ease with which time can be compressed onstage: in a matter of minutes, an entire naval battle is waged and\u00a0won. What Enobarbus witnesses certainly complicates our perception of Antony, demonstrating that his failures take place not just in his private affiliations but in his public life as well. Although by Caesar\u2019s and even by his own account he has neglected his duties to Rome, Antony has remained a fierce and respected soldier: his quietly threatening presence, as much as any offer of Sicily and Sardinia, persuades young Pompey to accept the triumvir\u2019s offer of peace. Indeed, until this point, the blemishes on Antony\u2019s character have been of a more personal nature: although he is twice an adulterer, although he has risked the security of the empire in order to partake in the pleasures of Egypt, his military prowess has never been in question. His retreat, however, conflicts with his values, as he is a man whose honor rests almost exclusively in his performance as a soldier. A number of critics have attacked this moment in the play, asserting that such a retreat by an experienced general is unbelievable. To condemn or dismiss this scene for its lack of realism, however, misses the point for several reasons. First, by failing to allow Antony to be both the famed soldier and the distracted lover, to be both noble and irresponsible, one simplifies and diminishes his character. Second, the lost navy battle is more crucial on a symbolic than a literal level, for Antony\u2019s decision to flee encapsulates the climactic neglect of duty that haunts him throughout the play. The aftermath of the battle shows that Antony is struggling with divided, competing identities. His lament that he has fled from himself shows that his character has developed beyond his own understanding. The self he believes he has fled is the military hero; the self he now confronts is a man whose heart can lead him into defeat as surely as his reason has led him into victory. The play, however, refuses to side with Antony in his argument against himself. We may share in Enobarbus\u2019s disapproval of his commander\u2019s performance, but surely we still view Antony as a worthy and sympathetic character. Indeed, the fallen general\u2019s plea to Cleopatra makes it impossible to respond to him with simple contempt: Egypt, thou knew\u2019st too wellMy heart was to thy rudder tied by th\u2019strings,And thou shouldst tow me after. O\u2019er my spiritThy full supremacy thou knew\u2019st, and thatThy beck might from the bidding of the godsCommand me.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(III.xi.56\u201361)  Antony\u2019s willingness to accept defeat out of his great love for Cleopatra does not make him a two-dimensional character, nor does it make him reprehensible to us. In fact, his flaws may be exactly what we respond to, since they highlight that he is human, riddled with weaknesses despite his famous strengths.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126032913/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/antony/section6/"}
