See Important Quotations Explained  In Inverness, Macbeth\u2019s castle, Lady Macbeth reads to herself a letter she has received from Macbeth. The letter announces Macbeth\u2019s promotion to the thaneship of Cawdor and details his meeting with the witches. Lady Macbeth murmurs that she knows Macbeth is ambitious, but fears he is too full of \u201cth\u2019 milk of human kindness\u201d to take the steps necessary to make himself king (1.5.15). She resolves to convince her husband to do whatever is required to seize the crown. A messenger enters and informs Lady Macbeth that the king rides toward the castle, and that Macbeth is on his way as well. As she awaits her husband\u2019s arrival, she delivers a famous speech in which she begs, \u201cyou spirits / That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, / And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full / Of direst cruelty\u201d (1.5.38\u201341). She resolves to put her natural femininity aside so that she can do the bloody deeds necessary to seize the crown. Macbeth enters, and he and his wife discuss the king\u2019s forthcoming visit. Macbeth tells his wife that Duncan plans to depart the next day, but Lady Macbeth declares that the king will never see tomorrow. She tells her husband to have patience and to leave the plan to her.

Duncan praises the castle\u2019s pleasant environment, and he thanks Lady Macbeth, who has emerged to greet him, for her hospitality. She replies that it is her duty to be hospitable since she and her husband owe so much to their king. Duncan then asks to be taken inside to Macbeth, whom he professes to love dearly.

He\u2019s here in double trust: First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, Strong both against the deed; then, as his host, Who should against his murderer shut the door, Not bear the knife myself. See Important Quotations Explained  Inside the castle, as oboes play and servants set a table for the evening\u2019s feast, Macbeth paces by himself, pondering his idea of assassinating Duncan. He says that the deed would be easy if he could be certain that it would not set in motion a series of terrible consequences. He declares his willingness to risk eternal damnation but realizes that even on earth, bloody actions \u201creturn / To plague th\u2019inventor\u201d (1.7.9\u201310). He then considers the reasons why he ought not to kill Duncan: Macbeth is Duncan\u2019s kinsman, subject, and host; moreover, the king is universally admired as a virtuous ruler. Macbeth notes that these circumstances offer him nothing that he can use to motivate himself. He faces the fact that there is no reason to kill the king other than his own ambition, which he realizes is an unreliable guide. Lady Macbeth enters and tells her husband that the king has dined and that he has been asking for Macbeth. Macbeth declares that he no longer intends to kill Duncan. Lady Macbeth, outraged, calls him a coward and questions his manhood: \u201cWhen you durst do it,\u201d she says, \u201cthen you were a man\u201d (1.7.49). He asks her what will happen if they fail; she promises that as long as they are bold, they will be successful. Then she tells him her plan: while Duncan sleeps, she will give his chamberlains wine to make them drunk, and then she and Macbeth can slip in and murder Duncan. They will smear the blood of Duncan on the sleeping chamberlains to cast the guilt upon them. Astonished at the brilliance and daring of her plan, Macbeth tells his wife that her \u201cundaunted mettle\u201d makes him hope that she will only give birth to male children (1.7.73). He then agrees to proceed with the murder. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act 1, scene 7\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act 1, scenes 5\u20137 These scenes are dominated by Lady Macbeth, who is probably the most memorable character in the play. Her violent, blistering soliloquies in Act 1, scenes 5 and 7, testify to her strength of will, which completely eclipses that of her husband. She is well aware of the discrepancy between their respective resolves and understands that she will have to manipulate her husband into acting on the witches\u2019 prophecy. Her soliloquy in Act 1, scene 5, begins the play\u2019s exploration of gender roles, particularly of the value and nature of masculinity. In the soliloquy, she spurns her feminine characteristics, crying out \u201cunsex me here\u201d and wishing that the milk in her breasts would be exchanged for \u201cgall\u201d so that she could murder Duncan herself. These remarks manifest Lady Macbeth\u2019s belief that manhood is defined by murder. When, in Act 1, scene\u00a07, her husband is hesitant to murder Duncan, she goads him by questioning his manhood and by implicitly comparing his willingness to carry through on his intention of killing Duncan with his ability to carry out a sexual act (1.7.38\u201341). Throughout the play, whenever Macbeth shows signs of faltering, Lady Macbeth implies that he is less than a man. Macbeth exclaims that Lady Macbeth should \u201c[b]ring forth men-children only\u201d because she is so bold and courageous (1.7.72). Since Macbeth succumbs to Lady Macbeth\u2019s wishes immediately following this remark, it seems that he is complimenting her and affirming her belief that courage and brilliance are masculine traits. But the comment also suggests that Macbeth is thinking about his legacy. He sees Lady Macbeth\u2019s boldness and masculinity as heroic and warriorlike, while Lady Macbeth invokes her supposed masculine \u201cvirtues\u201d for dark, cruel purposes. Unlike Macbeth, she seems solely concerned with immediate power.<PARAGRAPH>A subject\u2019s loyalty to his king is one of the thematic concerns of Macbeth. The plot of the play hinges on Macbeth\u2019s betrayal of Duncan, and, ultimately, of Scotland. Just as Lady Macbeth will prove to be the antithesis of the ideal wife, Macbeth proves to be a completely disloyal subject. In Act 1, scene\u00a07, for instance, Macbeth muses on Duncan\u2019s many good qualities, reflects that Duncan has been kind to him, and thinks that perhaps he ought not to kill his king. This is Macbeth\u2019s first lengthy soliloquy and thus the audience\u2019s first peek inside his mind. Yet Macbeth is unable to quell his desire for power. He evades answering his own questions of loyalty and yearns unrealistically for the battlefield\u2019s simple and consequence-free action\u2014\u201cIf it were done when \u2019tis done,\u201d he says, \u201cthen \u2019twere well / It were done quickly\u201d (1.7.1\u20132). At the same time, Macbeth is strongly conscious of the gravity of the act of regicide. He acknowledges that \u201cbloody instructions . . . being taught, return / To plague th\u2019inventor\u201d (1.7.9\u201310). This is the first of many lines linking \u201cblood\u201d to guilt and cosmic retribution. As her husband wavers, Lady Macbeth enters like a hurricane and blows his hesitant thoughts away. She spurs Macbeth to treason by disregarding his rational, moral arguments and challenging his manhood. Basically, she dares him to commit the murder, using words that taunt rather than persuade. Under her spell, all of Macbeth\u2019s objections seem to evaporate and he is left only with a weak \u201cIf we should fail?\u201d to set against her passionate challenge (1.7.59). The idea of a moral order is present in these scenes, albeit in muted form. Macbeth knows what he does is wrong, and he recognizes that there will surely be consequences. As we have seen, his soliloquy reveals his awareness that he may be initiating a cycle of violence that will eventually destroy him. Macbeth is not a good man at this point in the play, but he is not yet an evil one\u2014he is tempted, and he tries to resist temptation. Macbeth\u2019s resistance, however, is not vigorous enough to stand up to his wife\u2019s ability to manipulate him.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210202074745/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/macbeth/section2/"}
