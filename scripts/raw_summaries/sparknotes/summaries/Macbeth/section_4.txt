{"name": "Act 3, scenes 1\u20133", "summary": "Act 3, scene 1 In the royal palace at Forres, Banquo paces and thinks about the coronation of Macbeth and the prophecies of the weird sisters. The witches foretold that Macbeth would be king and that Banquo\u2019s line would eventually sit on the throne. If the first prophecy came true, Banquo thinks, feeling the stirring of ambition, why not the second? Macbeth enters, attired as king. He is followed by Lady Macbeth, now his queen, and the court. Macbeth and Lady Macbeth ask Banquo to attend the feast they will host that night. Banquo accepts their invitation and says that he plans to go for a ride on his horse for the afternoon. Macbeth mentions that they should discuss the problem of Malcolm and Donalbain. The brothers have fled from Scotland and may be plotting against his crown. Banquo departs, and Macbeth dismisses his court. He is left alone in the hall with a single servant, to whom he speaks about some men who have come to see him. Macbeth asks if the men are still waiting and orders that they be fetched. Once the servant has gone, Macbeth begins a soliloquy. He muses on the subject of Banquo, reflecting that his old friend is the only man in Scotland whom he fears. He notes that if the witches\u2019 prophecy is true, his will be a \u201cfruitless crown,\u201d by which he means that he will not have an heir (3.1.62). The murder of Duncan, which weighs so heavily on his conscience, may have simply cleared the way for Banquo\u2019s sons to overthrow Macbeth\u2019s own family. The servant reenters with Macbeth\u2019s two visitors. Macbeth reminds the two men, who are murderers he has hired, of a conversation he had with them the day before, in which he chronicled the wrongs Banquo had done them in the past. He asks if they are angry and manly enough to take revenge on Banquo. They reply that they are, and Macbeth accepts their promise that they will murder his former friend. Macbeth reminds the murderers that Fleance must be killed along with his father and tells them to wait within the castle for his command.

Macbeth enters and tells his wife that he too is discontented, saying that his mind is \u201cfull of scorpions\u201d (3.2.37). He feels that the business that they began by\u00a0killing Duncan is not yet complete because there are still threats\u00a0to the throne that must be eliminated. Macbeth tells his wife that he has planned \u201ca deed of dreadful note\u201d for Banquo and Fleance and urges her to be jovial and kind to Banquo during the evening\u2019s feast, in order to lure their next victim into a false sense of security (3.2.45).

Banquo and Fleance approach on their horses and dismount. They light a torch, and the murderers set upon them. The murderers kill Banquo, who dies urging his son to flee and to avenge his death. One of the murderers extinguishes the torch, and in the darkness Fleance escapes. The murderers leave with Banquo\u2019s body to find Macbeth and tell him what has happened.

He seems to have gotten used to the idea, as by this point the body count has risen to alarming levels. Now that the first part of the witches\u2019 prophecy has come true, Macbeth feels that he must kill his friend Banquo and the young Fleance in order to prevent the second part from becoming realized. But, as Fleance\u2019s survival suggests, there can be no escape from the witches\u2019 prophecies.<PARAGRAPH>Macbeth and his wife seem to have traded roles. As he talks to the murderers, Macbeth adopts the same rhetoric that Lady Macbeth used to convince him to murder in Act 1, scene 7. He questions their manhood in order to make them angry, and their desire to murder Banquo and Fleance grows out of their desire to prove themselves to be men. In the scene with Lady Macbeth that follows, Macbeth again echoes her previous comments. She told him earlier that he must \u201clook like the innocent flower, / But be the serpent under\u2019t\u201d (1.5.63\u201364). Now he is the one reminding her to mask her unease, as he says that they must \u201cmake [their] faces visors to [their] hearts, / Disguising what they are\u201d (3.2.35\u201336). Yet, despite his displays of fearlessness, Macbeth is undeniably beset with guilt and doubt, which he expresses in his reference to the \u201cscorpions\u201d in his mind and in his declaration that in killing Banquo they \u201chave scorched the snake, not killed it\u201d (3.2.15). While her husband grows bolder, Lady Macbeth begins to despair\u2014\u201cNaught\u2019s had; all\u2019s spent,\u201d she says (3.2.6). It is difficult to believe that the woman who now attempts to talk her husband out of committing more murders is the same Lady Macbeth who earlier spurred her husband on to slaughter. Just as he begins to echo her earlier statements, she references his. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done\u201d (3.2.14), she says wishfully, echoing her husband\u2019s use of \u201cdone\u201d in Act 1, scene 7, where he said: \u201cIf it were done when \u2019tis done, then \u2019twere well / It were done quickly\u201d (1.7.1\u20132). But as husband and wife begin to realize, nothing is \u201cdone\u201d whatsoever; their sense of closure is an illusion. Both characters seem shocked and dismayed that possessing the crown has not rid them of trouble or brought them happiness. The language that they use is fraught with imagery suggestive of suspicion, paranoia, and inner turmoil, like Macbeth\u2019s evocative \u201cfull of scorpions is my mind, dear wife\u201d (3.2.37). Each murder Macbeth commits or commissions is intended to bring him security and contentment, but the deeper his arms sink in blood, the more violent and horrified he becomes. By the start of Act 3, the play\u2019s main theme\u2014the repercussions of acting on ambition without moral constraint\u2014has been articulated and explored. The play now builds inexorably toward its end. Unlike Hamlet, in which the plot seems open to multiple possibilities up to the final scene, Macbeth\u2019s action seems to develop inevitably. We know that there is nothing to stop Macbeth\u2019s murder spree except his own death, and it is for that death that the audience now waits. Only with Macbeth\u2019s demise, we realize, can any kind of moral order be restored to Scotland.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210202074745/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/macbeth/section5/"}
