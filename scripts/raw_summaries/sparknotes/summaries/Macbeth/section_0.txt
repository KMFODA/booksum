{"name": "Act 1, scenes 1\u20134", "summary": "Act 1, scene 1 Thunder and lightning crash above a Scottish moor. Three haggard old women, the witches, appear out of the storm. In eerie, chanting tones, they make plans to meet again upon the heath, after the battle, to confront Macbeth. As quickly as they arrive, they disappear. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act 1, scene 1\u00a0\u2192  Act 1, scene 2 At a military camp near his palace at Forres, King Duncan of Scotland asks a wounded captain for news about the Scots\u2019 battle with the Irish invaders, who are led by the rebel Macdonwald. The captain, who was wounded helping Duncan\u2019s son Malcolm escape capture by the Irish, replies that the Scottish generals Macbeth and Banquo fought with great courage and violence. The captain then describes for Duncan how Macbeth slew the traitorous Macdonwald. As the captain is carried off to have his wounds attended to, the thane of Ross, a Scottish nobleman, enters and tells the king that the traitorous thane of Cawdor has been defeated and the army of Norway repelled. Duncan decrees that the thane of Cawdor be put to death and that Macbeth, the hero of the victorious army, be given Cawdor\u2019s title. Ross leaves to deliver the news to Macbeth. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act 1, scene 2\u00a0\u2192  Act 1, scene 3 On the heath near the battlefield, thunder rolls and the three witches appear. One says that she has just come from \u201c[k]illing swine\u201d and another describes the revenge she has planned upon a sailor whose wife refused to share her chestnuts. Suddenly a drum beats, and the third witch cries that Macbeth is coming. Macbeth and Banquo, on their way to the king\u2019s court at Forres, come upon the witches and shrink in horror at the sight of the old women. Banquo asks whether they are mortal, noting that they don\u2019t seem to be \u201cinhabitants o\u2019 th\u2019 earth\u201d (1.3.39). He also wonders whether they are really women, since they seem to have beards like men. The witches hail Macbeth as thane of Glamis (his original title) and as thane of Cawdor. Macbeth is baffled by this second title, as he has not yet heard of King Duncan\u2019s decision. The witches also declare that Macbeth will be king one day. Stunned and intrigued, Macbeth presses the witches for more information, but they have turned their attention to Banquo, speaking in yet more riddles. They call Banquo \u201clesser than Macbeth, and greater,\u201d and \u201cnot so happy, yet much happier\u201d; then they tell him that he will never be king but that his children will sit upon the throne (1.3.63\u201365). Macbeth implores the witches to explain what they meant by calling him thane of Cawdor, but they vanish into thin air. In disbelief, Macbeth and Banquo discuss the strange encounter. Macbeth fixates on the details of the prophecy. \u201cYour children shall be kings,\u201d he says to his friend, to which Banquo responds: \u201cYou shall be king\u201d (1.3.84). Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Ross and Angus, who have come to convey them to the king. Ross tells Macbeth that the king has made him thane of Cawdor, as the former thane is to be executed for treason. Macbeth, amazed that the witches\u2019 prophecy has come true, asks Banquo if he hopes his children will be kings. Banquo replies that devils often tell half-truths in order to \u201cwin us to our harm\u201d (1.3.121). Macbeth ignores his companions and speaks to himself, ruminating upon the possibility that he might one day be king. He wonders whether the reign will simply fall to him or whether he will have to perform a dark deed in order to gain the crown. At last he shakes himself from his reverie and the group departs for Forres. As they leave, Macbeth whispers to Banquo that, at a later time, he would like to speak to him privately about what has transpired.

Macbeth and Banquo enter with Ross and Angus. Duncan thanks the two generals profusely for their heroism in the battle, and they profess their loyalty and gratitude toward Duncan. Duncan announces his intention to name Malcolm the heir to his throne. Macbeth declares his joy but notes to himself that Malcolm now stands between him and the crown. Plans are made for Duncan to dine at Macbeth\u2019s castle that evening, and Macbeth goes on ahead of the royal party to inform his wife of the king\u2019s impending arrival. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act 1, scene 4\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act 1, scenes 1\u20134 These scenes establish the play\u2019s dramatic premise\u2014the witches\u2019 awakening of Macbeth\u2019s ambition\u2014and present the main characters and their relationships. At the same time, the first three scenes establish a dark mood that permeates the entire play. The stage directions indicate that the play begins with a storm, and malignant supernatural forces immediately appear in the form of the three witches. From there, the action quickly shifts to a battlefield that is dominated by a sense of the grisliness and cruelty of war. In his description of Macbeth and Banquo\u2019s heroics, the captain dwells specifically on images of carnage: \u201che unseamed him from the nave to th\u2019 chops,\u201d he says, describing Macbeth\u2019s slaying of Macdonwald (1.2.22). The bloody murders that fill the play are foreshadowed by the bloody victory that the Scots win over their enemies.<PARAGRAPH>Our initial impression of Macbeth, based on the captain\u2019s report of his valor and prowess in battle, is immediately complicated by Macbeth\u2019s obvious fixation upon the witches\u2019 prophecy. Macbeth is a noble and courageous warrior but his reaction to the witches\u2019 pronouncements emphasizes his great desire for power and prestige. Macbeth immediately realizes that the fulfillment of the prophecy may require conspiracy and murder on his part. He clearly allows himself to consider taking such actions, although he is by no means resolved to do so. His reaction to the prophecy displays a fundamental confusion and inactivity: instead of resolving to act on the witches\u2019 claims, or simply dismissing them, Macbeth talks himself into a kind of thoughtful stupor as he tries to work out the situation for himself. In the following scene, Lady Macbeth will emerge and drive the hesitant Macbeth to act; she is the will propelling his achievements. Once Lady Macbeth hears of the witches\u2019 prophecy, Duncan\u2019s life is doomed.  Macbeth contains some of Shakespeare\u2019s most vivid female characters. Lady Macbeth and the three witches are extremely wicked, but they are also stronger and more imposing than the men around them. The sinister witches cast the mood for the entire play. Their rhyming incantations stand out eerily amid the blank verse spoken by the other characters, and their grotesque figures of speech establish a lingering aura. Whenever they appear, the stage directions deliberately link them to unease and lurking chaos in the natural world by insisting on \u201cThunder\u201d or \u201cThunder and lightning.\u201d Shakespeare has the witches speak in language of contradiction. Their famous line \u201cFair is foul, and foul is fair\u201d is a prominent example (1.1.10), but there are many others, such as their characterization of Banquo as \u201clesser than Macbeth, and greater\u201d (1.3.63). Such speech adds to the play\u2019s sense of moral confusion by implying that nothing is quite what it seems. Interestingly, Macbeth\u2019s first line in the play is \u201cSo foul and fair a day I have not seen\u201d (1.3.36). This line echoes the witches\u2019 words and establishes a connection between them and Macbeth. It also suggests that Macbeth is the focus of the drama\u2019s moral confusion.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210202074745/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/macbeth/section1/"}
