See Important Quotations Explained  At night, in the king\u2019s palace at Dunsinane, a doctor and a gentlewoman discuss Lady Macbeth\u2019s strange habit of sleepwalking. Suddenly, Lady Macbeth enters in a trance with a candle in her hand. Bemoaning the murders of Lady Macduff and Banquo, she seems to see blood on her hands and claims that nothing will ever wash it off. She leaves, and the doctor and gentlewoman marvel at her descent into madness.

See Important Quotations Explained  Within the castle, Macbeth blusteringly orders that banners be hung and boasts that his castle will repel the enemy. A woman\u2019s cry is heard, and Seyton appears to tell Macbeth that the queen is dead. Shocked, Macbeth speaks numbly about the passage of time and declares famously that life is \u201ca tale / Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, / Signifying nothing\u201d (5.5.25\u201327). A messenger enters with astonishing news: the trees of Birnam Wood are advancing toward Dunsinane. Enraged and terrified, Macbeth recalls the prophecy that said he could not die till Birnam Wood moved to Dunsinane. Resignedly, he declares that he is tired of the sun and that at least he will die fighting.

Act 5, scene 10 Elsewhere on the battlefield, Macbeth at last encounters Macduff. They fight, and when Macbeth insists that he is invincible because of the witches\u2019 prophecy, Macduff tells Macbeth that he was not of woman born, but rather \u201cfrom his mother\u2019s womb / Untimely ripped\u201d (5.10.15\u201316). Macbeth suddenly fears for his life, but he declares that he will not surrender \u201c[t]o kiss the ground before young Malcolm\u2019s feet, / And to be baited with the rabble\u2019s curse\u201d (5.10.28\u201329). They exit fighting.  Act 5, scene 11 Malcolm and Siward walk together in the castle, which they have now effectively captured. Ross tells Siward that his son is dead. Macduff emerges with Macbeth\u2019s head in his hand and proclaims Malcolm King of Scotland. Malcolm declares that all his thanes will be made earls, according to the English system of peerage. They will be the first such lords in Scottish history. Cursing Macbeth and his \u201cfiend-like\u201d queen, Malcolm calls all those around him his friends and invites them all to see him crowned at Scone (5.11.35).", "analysis": "Act 5, scenes 1\u201311 The rapid tempo of the play\u2019s development accelerates into breakneck frenzy in Act 5, as the relatively long scenes of previous acts are replaced by a flurry of short takes, each of which furthers the action toward its violent conclusion on the battlefield outside Dunsinane Castle. We see the army\u2019s and Malcolm\u2019s preparation for battle, the fulfillment of the witches\u2019 prophecies, and the demises of both Lady Macbeth and Macbeth. Lady Macbeth, her icy nerves shattered by the weight of guilt and paranoia, gives way to sleepwalking and a delusional belief that her hands are stained with blood. \u201cOut, damned spot,\u201d she cries in one of the play\u2019s most famous lines, and adds, \u201c[W]ho would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?\u201d (5.1.30, 33\u201334). Her belief that nothing can wash away the blood is, of course, an ironic and painful reversal of her earlier claim to Macbeth that \u201c[a] little water clears us of this deed\u201d (2.2.65). Macbeth, too, is unable to sleep. His and Lady Macbeth\u2019s sleeplessness was foreshadowed by Macbeth\u2019s hallucination at the moment of the murder, when he believed that a voice cried out \u201cMacbeth does murder sleep\u201d (2.2.34).<PARAGRAPH>Like Duncan\u2019s death and Macbeth\u2019s ascension to the kingship, Lady Macbeth\u2019s suicide does not take place onstage; it is merely reported. Macbeth seems numb in response to the news of his wife\u2019s death, which seems surprising, especially given the great love he appears to have borne for his wife. Yet, his indifferent response reflects the despair that has seized him as he realizes that what has come to seem the game of life is almost up. Indeed, Macbeth\u2019s speech following his wife\u2019s death is one of the most famous expressions of despair in all of literature. \u201cTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,\u201d he says grimly, Creeps in this petty pace from day to dayTo the last syllable of recorded time,And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death. Out, out brief candle.Life\u2019s but a walking shadow, a poor playerThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more. It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing. (5.5.18\u201327)  These words reflect Macbeth\u2019s feeling of hopelessness, of course, but they have a self-justifying streak as well\u2014for if life is \u201cfull of sound and fury, / Signifying nothing,\u201d then Macbeth\u2019s crimes, too, are meaningless rather than evil. Additionally, the speech\u2019s insistence that \u201c[l]ife\u2019s . . . a poor player / That struts and frets his hour upon the stage\u201d can be read as a dark and somewhat subversive commentary on the relationship between the audience and the play. After all, Macbeth is just a player on an English stage, and his statement undercuts the suspension of disbelief that the audience must maintain in order to enter the action of the play. If we take Macbeth\u2019s statement as expressing Shakespeare\u2019s own perspective on the theater, then the entire play can be seen as being \u201cfull of sound and fury, / Signifying nothing.\u201d Admittedly, it seems unlikely that the playwright would have put his own perspective on the stage in the mouth of a despairing, desperate murderer. Still, Macbeth\u2019s words remind us of the essential theatricality of the action\u2014that the lengthy soliloquies, offstage deaths, and poetic speeches are not meant to capture reality but to reinterpret it in order to evoke a certain emotional response from the audience. Despite the pure nihilism of this speech, Macbeth seems to fluctuate between despair and ridiculous bravado, making his own dissolution rougher and more complex than that of his wife. Lured into a false sense of security by the final prophecies of the witches, he gives way to boastfulness and a kind of self-destructive arrogance. When the battle begins, Macbeth clings, against all apparent evidence, to the notion that he will not be harmed because he is protected by the prophecy\u2014although whether he really believes it at this stage, or is merely hanging on to the last thread of hope he has left, is debatable. Macbeth ceased to be a sympathetic hero once he made the decision to kill Duncan, but by the end of the play he has become so morally repulsive that his death comes as a powerful relief. Ambition and bloodlust must be checked by virtue for order and form to be restored to the sound and fury of human existence. Only with Malcolm\u2019s victory and assumption of the crown can Scotland, and the play itself, be saved from the chaos engendered by Macbeth.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210202074745/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/macbeth/section8/"}
