Analysis \u2014 Act II, scenes i\u2013vi In Cyrano de Bergerac, poetry either splits lovers apart or binds them together. Poetry divides Ragueneau and Lise, providing the main conflict in their marriage. Whereas Ragueneau is a caring, compassionate individual with a weakness for poets and poetry, Lise, his domineering wife, disparages poetry, pasting old pages of poems together to make bags for the shop. Her disgust becomes even more obvious when her affair with the musketeer becomes apparent. Ragueneau risks his business and his marriage by constantly giving out large amounts of pastries in return for poems. Meanwhile, the power of poetry will soon begin to bring other lovers together, and Ragueneau\u2019s poetic shop will play an important role in that process. In this scene, the sequence of letter-writing that continues through the rest of the play begins when Roxane and Cyrano meet in Ragueneau\u2019s shop. \tCyrano once again exhibits his greatest strengths and weaknesses within the same scene. He stands up for Ragueneau\u2019s honor by threatening Lise and the musketeer. Cyrano will not allow them to deceive Ragueneau while they continue their dishonorable affair. Cyrano may not cherish Ragueneau\u2019s poems, but he respects his character and the goodwill he shows to him and to the other poets. Cyrano\u2019s fragility comes across in his nervousness during his meeting with Roxane. Cyrano is often courageous and fearless, but not when it comes to love. Despite his remarkable talents and abilities, he has the self-doubt and sense of vulnerability common to almost everyone. \tWhen Roxane arrives, it seems as though Cyrano\u2019s dream has come true. She begins to talk about a love interest of hers, and throughout her lengthy and somewhat stealthy description of the man, Cyrano appears to believe that she is talking about him. When she says that this man is \u201chandsome,\u201d Cyrano concludes that the man cannot be him, highlighting one of his most profound and destructive flaws\u2014lack of self-esteem. Cyrano soon convinces himself that Roxane will never reciprocate his love. Sad and despondent, Cyrano resolves to help Christian win her heart. Cyrano\u2019s resolve, as well as his promise to protect Christian, demonstrates his essential heroic qualities. He combats rejection and dejection with selfless love\u2014perhaps Cyrano\u2019s most impressive quality displayed thus far.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115184120/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cyrano/section2/"}
