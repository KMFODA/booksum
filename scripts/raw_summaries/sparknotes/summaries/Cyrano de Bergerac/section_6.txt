Cyrano gives Roxane a comical summary of the news of the court, but his face becomes more and more tortured, and he finally loses consciousness. \tRoxane runs to his side, and he comes to, telling her his injury meant nothing and is merely an old wound. Roxane touches her heart and says they all have their old wounds. Cyrano asks about Christian\u2019s letter and reminds Roxane that he would like to read it someday.

Suddenly, it all becomes clear to her, and she exclaims that she has realized that it was Cyrano all along. He denies it, but she now knows the truth.

Cyrano says he has not finished his gazette. He adds that on Saturday the 26th, an hour before dinner, Monsieur de Bergerac was murdered. He removes his hat and shows his head swathed in bandages.

Cyrano asks if the audience liked it, and Ragueneau says that they laughed and laughed.

But realizing that he is dying, Roxane cries out that she loved only one man in her life, and now she has lost him\u2014twice. \tCyrano becomes delirious.

Suddenly, he drops his sword and falls into the arms of Le Bret and Ragueneau. Roxane kisses him on the forehead and asks what immaculate thing he will take to heaven with him. As he dies, Cyrano opens his eyes and looks at her. He replies, \u201cMy white plume.\u201d Analysis \u2014 Act V, scenes i-vi Act V is the play\u2019s dramatic epilogue. Set fifteen years after the main action, the poignant tragedy of this act ties up the story line following Christian\u2019s death. The setting of this section of the play is important\u2014it takes place at twilight on an autumn day. Both the hour and the season connote endings, changes, and death. The -setting also serves as a metaphor for Roxane\u2019s changing view of physical beauty. Her realization that Cyrano wrote the letters occurs only when she notices Cyrano reading Christian\u2019s farewell letter in the dark. Once the outward visual signs lose their importance, Roxane hears Cyrano\u2019s true voice and words. The metaphorical setting creates a highly sentimental ending. Indeed, one common criticism of the play is that its final scenes become swooning and melodramatic.<PARAGRAPH>Cyrano\u2019s death scene mimics his overall plight. Denied the chance to die in battle on the sword of a hero, he instead dies after being ambushed by a falling log . Cyrano\u2019s death, like his character, is simultaneously tragic, ironic, and comedic. However, he always manages to elude his fated failure, and he dies fighting not against a mortal hero but against the specters of falsehood, cowardice, and compromise\u2014all of his \u201cold enemies.\u201d Throughout the play, Cyrano suffers both because of his appearance and because of his unwillingness to sacrifice his principles. By this time, his long nose has become a symbol of his honorable nature and a reminder of its consequences. Cyrano dies fighting unconquerable vices but he knowing that Roxane loves him at last, despite his appearance. He says he will take his unstained white plume with him to heaven\u2014the white plume is the mark of a leader on the battlefield and the symbol of courage. He may die, but his honor will remain pure and unstained. \tCyrano\u2019s painful realization that his life has been a failure looms over the brief bits of humor. He argues that his life has been largely unfulfilling despite moments of fleeting success. Throughout the play, Cyrano has displayed courage and bravado, but he never attains his goals or realizes his dreams. Tragically, Roxane comes to know his secret and love him only after he has been dealt his final blow. For these reasons, some critics consider Cyrano de Bergerac a heroic tragedy rather than a heroic comedy.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115184120/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cyrano/section7/"}
