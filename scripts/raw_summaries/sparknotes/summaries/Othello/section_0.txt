See Important Quotations Explained   Othello begins on a street in Venice, in the midst of an argument between Roderigo and Iago. The rich Roderigo has been paying Iago to help him in his suit to Desdemona, but he has seen no progress, and he has just learned that Desdemona has married Othello, a general whom Iago serves as ensign. Iago reassures Roderigo that he hates Othello. Chief among Iago\u2019s reasons for this hatred is Othello\u2019s recent promotion of Michael Cassio to the post of lieutenant. In spite of Iago\u2019s service in battle and the recommendation of three \u201cgreat ones\u201d of the city, Othello chose to give the position to a man with no experience leading men in battle. As he waits for an opportunity to further his own self-interest, Iago only pretends to serve Othello. Iago advises Roderigo to spoil some of Othello\u2019s pleasure in his marriage by rousing Desdemona\u2019s family against the general. The two men come to the street outside the house of Desdemona\u2019s father, Brabanzio, and cry out that he has been robbed by \u201cthieves.\u201d Brabanzio, who is a Venetian senator, comes to the window. At first, he doesn\u2019t believe what he hears, because he has told Roderigo to stay away from his daughter before and thinks Roderigo is merely scheming once again in order to see Desdemona. Iago speaks in inflammatory terms, vulgarly telling the senator that his daughter and Othello are having sex by saying that they are \u201cmaking the beast with two backs\u201d (I.i.118). Brabanzio begins to take what he hears seriously and decides to search for his daughter. Seeing the success of his plan, Iago leaves Roderigo alone and goes to attend on Othello. Like Brabanzio, Othello has no idea of Iago\u2019s role in Roderigo\u2019s accusations. As Iago departs, Brabanzio comes out of his house, furious that his daughter has left him. Declaring that his daughter has been stolen from him by magic \u201ccharms,\u201d Brabanzio and his men follow Roderigo to Othello.

Othello sees a party of men approaching, and Iago, thinking that Brabanzio and his followers have arrived, counsels Othello to retreat indoors. Othello stands his ground, but the party turns out to be Cassio and officers from the Venetian court. They bring Othello the message that he is wanted by the duke of Venice about a matter concerning Cyprus, an island in the Mediterranean Sea controlled by Venice. As Cassio and his men prepare to leave, Iago mentions that Othello is married, but before he can say any more, Brabanzio, Roderigo, and Brabanzio\u2019s men arrive to accost Othello. Brabanzio orders his men to attack and subdue Othello. A struggle between Brabanzio\u2019s and Othello\u2019s followers seems imminent, but Othello brings the confrontation to a halt by calmly and authoritatively telling both sides to put up their swords. Hearing that the duke has summoned Othello to the court, Brabanzio decides to bring his cause before the duke himself. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act I, scene ii\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act I, scenes i\u2013ii The action of the first scene heightens the audience\u2019s anticipation of Othello\u2019s first appearance. We learn Iago\u2019s name in the second line of the play and Roderigo\u2019s soon afterward, but Othello is not once mentioned by his name. Rather, he is ambiguously referred to as \u201che\u201d and \u201chim.\u201d He is also called \u201cthe Moor\u201d (I.i.57), \u201cthe thick-lips\u201d (I.i.66), and \u201ca Barbary horse\u201d (I.i.113)\u2014all names signifying that he is dark-skinned. Iago plays on the senator\u2019s fears, making him imagine a barbarous and threatening Moor, or native of Africa, whose bestial sexual appetite has turned him into a thief and a rapist. Knowing nothing of Othello, one would expect that the audience, too, would be seduced by Iago\u2019s portrait of the general, but several factors keep us from believing him. In the first place, Roderigo is clearly a pathetic and jealous character. He adores Desdemona, but she has married Othello and seems unaware of Roderigo\u2019s existence. Roderigo doesn\u2019t even have the ability to woo Desdemona on his own: he has already appealed to Brabanzio for Desdemona\u2019s hand, and when that fails, he turns to Iago for help. Rich and inexperienced, Roderigo na\u00efvely gives his money to Iago in exchange for vague but unfulfilled promises of amorous success. The fact that Iago immediately paints himself as the villain also prepares us to be sympathetic to Othello. Iago explains to Roderigo that he has no respect for Othello beyond what he has to show to further his own revenge: \u201cI follow him to serve my turn upon him\u201d (I.i.42). Iago explicitly delights in his villainy, always tipping the audience off about his plotting. In these first two scenes, Iago tells Roderigo to shout beneath Brabanzio\u2019s window and predicts exactly what will happen when they do so. Once Brabanzio has been roused, Iago also tells Roderigo where he can meet Othello. Because of the dramatic irony Iago establishes, the audience is forced into a position of feeling intimately connected with Iago\u2019s villainy.<PARAGRAPH>In many ways, Iago is the driving force behind the plot, a playwright of sorts whose machinations inspire the action of the play. His self-conscious falseness is highly theatrical, calculated to shock the audience. Iago is a classic two-faced villain, a type of character known in Shakespeare\u2019s time as a \u201cMachiavel\u201d\u2014a villain who, adhering all too literally to the teachings of the political philosopher Machiavelli, lets nothing stand in his way in his quest for power. He is also reminiscent of the stock character of Vice from medieval morality plays, who also announces to the audience his diabolical schemes. After having been prepared for a passionate and possibly violent personage in Othello, the quiet calm of Othello\u2019s character\u2014his dismissal of Roderigo\u2019s alleged insult and his skillful avoidance of conflict\u2014is surprising. In fact, far from presenting Othello as a savage barbarian, Shakespeare implicitly compares him to Christ. The moment when Brabanzio and his men arrive with swords and torches, tipped off to Othello\u2019s whereabouts by Othello\u2019s disloyal friend, vividly echoes John 18:1\u201311. In that Gospel, Christ and his followers are met by officers carrying swords and torches. The officers were informed of Christ\u2019s whereabouts by Judas, who pretends to side with Christ in the ensuing confrontation. When Othello averts the violence that seems imminent with a single sentence, \u201cKeep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust \u2019em\u201d (I.ii.60), he echoes Christ\u2019s command to Peter, \u201cPut up thy sword into the sheath\u201d (John 18:11). However, whereas Christ\u2019s calm restraint is due to his resigned acceptance of his fate, Othello\u2019s is due to his sense of his own authority.  Brabanzio twice accuses Othello of using magic to seduce his daughter (in I.i.172\u2013173 and I.ii.73\u201380), and he repeats the same charge a third time in front of the duke in Act I, scene iii. Even though Shakespeare\u2019s audience would have considered elopement with a nobleman\u2019s daughter to be a serious, possibly imprisonable offense, Brabanzio insists that he wants to arrest and prosecute Othello specifically for the crime of witchcraft, not for eloping with his daughter without his consent. Brabanzio\u2019s racism is clear\u2014he claims that he simply cannot believe that Desdemona would be attracted to the Moor unless her reason and senses were blinded. Yet, it is possible that Brabanzio is not being sincere. He may feel that he needs to accuse Othello of a crime more serious than elopement because he knows the duke will overlook Othello\u2019s infraction otherwise.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210228191258/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/othello/section1/"}
