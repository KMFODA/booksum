{"name": "Act II, scenes i\u2013ii", "summary": "Act II, scene i On the shores of Cyprus, Montano, the island\u2019s governor, watches a storm with two gentlemen. Just as Montano says that the Turkish fleet of ships could not survive the storm, a third gentlemen comes to confirm his prediction: as his ship traveled from Venice, Cassio witnessed that the Turks lost most of their fleet in the tempest. It is still uncertain whether Othello\u2019s ship has been able to survive the storm. Hope lifts as voices offstage announce the sighting of a sail offshore, but the new ship turns out to be carrying Iago, Emilia, Desdemona, and Roderigo. Desdemona disembarks, and no sooner does Cassio tell her that Othello has yet to arrive than a friendly shot announces the arrival of a third ship. While the company waits for the ship, Cassio and Desdemona tease Emilia about being a chatterbox, but Iago quickly takes the opportunity to criticize women in general as deceptive and hypocritical, saying they are lazy in all matters except sex: \u201cYou rise to play and go to bed to work\u201d (II.i.118). Desdemona plays along, laughing as Iago belittles women, whether beautiful or ugly, intelligent or stupid, as equally despicable. Cassio takes Desdemona away to speak with her privately about Othello\u2019s arrival. Iago notices that Cassio takes Desdemona\u2019s hand as he talks to her, and, in an aside, Iago plots to use Cassio\u2019s hand-holding to frame him so that he loses his newly gained promotion to lieutenant. \u201cWith as little a web as this I will ensnare as great a fly as Cassio,\u201d he asserts (II.i.169). Othello arrives safely and greets Desdemona, expressing his devotion to her and giving her a kiss. He then thanks the Cypriots for their welcome and hospitality, and orders Iago to unload the ship. All but Roderigo and Iago head to the castle to celebrate the drowning of the Turks. Iago tells the despondent Roderigo that Desdemona will soon grow tired of being with Othello and will long for a more well-mannered and handsome man. But, Iago continues, the obvious first choice for Desdemona will be Cassio, whom Iago characterizes over and over again as a \u201cknave\u201d (II.i.231\u2013239). Roderigo tries to argue that Cassio was merely being polite by taking Desdemona\u2019s hand, but Iago convinces him of Cassio\u2019s ill intentions and convinces Roderigo to start a quarrel with Cassio that evening. He posits that the uproar the quarrel will cause in the still tense city will make Cassio fall out of favor with Othello. Left alone onstage again, Iago explains his actions to the audience in a soliloquy. He secretly lusts after Desdemona, partially because he suspects that Othello has slept with Emilia, and he wants to get even with the Moor \u201cwife for wife\u201d (II.i.286). But, Iago continues, if he is unable to get his revenge by sleeping with Desdemona, Roderigo\u2019s accusation of Cassio will make Othello suspect his lieutenant of sleeping with his wife and torture Othello to madness. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act II, scene i\u00a0\u2192  Act II, scene ii A herald announces that Othello plans revelry for the evening in celebration of Cyprus\u2019s safety from the Turks, and also in celebration of his marriage to Desdemona. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act II, scene ii\u00a0\u2192", "analysis": "Act II, scenes i\u2013ii Like Act I, scene ii, the first scene of Act II begins with emphasis on the limitations of sight. \u201cWhat from the cape can you discern at sea?\u201d Montano asks, and the gentleman replies, \u201cNothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood\u201d (II.i.1\u20132). The emphasis on the limitations of physical sight in a tempest foreshadows what will, after Act III, become Othello\u2019s metaphorical blindness, caused by his passion and rage. Similarly, once the physical threat that the Turks pose has been eliminated, the more psychological, less tangible threat posed by inner demons assumes dramatic precedence. The play extinguishes the external threat with almost ridiculous speed. The line \u201cNews, lads! Our wars are done,\u201d is all that is needed to dismiss the plot involving the Turks (II.i.20). It is as though one kind of play ends at the end of Act II, scene ii, and another begins: what seemed to be a political tragedy becomes a domestic tragedy. Whereas the action of the play began on the streets of Venice and proceeded to the court and then to the beaches of Cyprus, it now moves to the passageways of Othello\u2019s residence on the island and ultimately ends in his bedchamber. The effect is almost cinematic\u2014like a long and gradual close-up that restricts the visible space around the tragic hero, emphasizing his metaphorical blindness and symbolizing his imprisonment in his own jealous fantasies. This ever-tightening focus has led many readers to characterize the play as \u201cclaustrophobic.\u201d The banter between Iago and Desdemona creates a nervous, uncomfortable atmosphere, in part because their levity is inappropriate, given that Othello\u2019s ship remains missing. The rhyming couplets in which Iago expresses his misogynistic insults lend them an eerie, alienating quality, and Desdemona\u2019s active encouragement of Iago is somewhat puzzling. Once again, Desdemona establishes herself as an outspoken and independent woman\u2014she does not depend upon her husband\u2019s presence either socially or intellectually. However, Desdemona does not suggest that she has any interest in cheating on her husband. Iago himself tells us that he will make a mountain out of the molehill represented by Cassio\u2019s holding of Desdemona\u2019s hand.<PARAGRAPH>Although Iago verbally abuses women in this scene\u2014presumably because it is safe for him to do so\u2014his real resentment seems to be against those characters who have a higher social class than he has, including Cassio and Desdemona. Iago resents Cassio for being promoted ahead of him, and Cassio\u2019s promotion is likely due to his higher class status. At the beginning of the play, Iago argued that he ought to have been promoted based upon his worth as a soldier, and he expressed bitterness that \u201c[p]referment goes by letter and affection, / And not by old gradation\u201d (I.i.35\u201336). In Act II, scene i, Cassio contributes to Iago\u2019s anger by taunting the ensign about his inferior status: \u201cLet it not gall your patience, good Iago, / That I extend my manners. \u2019Tis my breeding / That gives me this bold show of courtesy\u201d (II.i.100\u2013102). Not long afterward, Iago makes fun of Roderigo for being \u201cbase\u201d (meaning lower class), even though the play does not indicate that Roderigo is, in fact, of lower status than Iago (II.i.212). In the soliloquy that concludes Act II, scene i, Iago once again explains quite clearly what he intends to do, despite his comment that his plan is \u201cyet confused\u201d (II.i.298). At the same time, his statements about what motivates him are hazy and confusing. Is he motivated by lust for Desdemona, envy of Cassio, or jealousy over his wife\u2019s supposed affair with Othello? He even throws in a bizarre parenthetical suspicion that Cassio might also have slept with his wife (II.i.294). It is as though Iago mocks the audience for attempting to determine his motives; he treats the audience as he does Othello and Roderigo, leading his listeners \u201cby th\u2019 nose / As asses are [led]\u201d (I.iii.383\u2013384). For each of Iago\u2019s actions, he creates a momentary and unimportant justification.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210228191258/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/othello/section3/"}
