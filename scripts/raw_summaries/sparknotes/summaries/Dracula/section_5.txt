{"name": "Chapters XII\u2013XIV", "summary": "Chapter XII  The narrative returns to Seward\u2019s diary entries. Arriving at the Westenras\u2019 the next day, Van Helsing and Seward find the scene of destruction: the maids unconscious on the dining room floor, Mrs. Westenra dead, and Lucy once again at death\u2019s door, with terrible, mangled wounds at her neck. Neither of the men can spare any more blood, but Lucy\u2019s third suitor, Quincey Morris, appears and agrees to take part in a transfusion. Puzzled, Morris asks what has become of all the blood that has already been transferred to Lucy. Holmwood arrives. His father\u2019s recent death, combined with the loss of Mrs. Westenra and Lucy\u2019s failing health, nearly makes him despondent, but his presence helps rally his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s spirits. Unaware of what has befallen Lucy, Mina writes a letter informing Lucy that she and Jonathan have married and have returned to England. Dr. Seward\u2019s assistant writes to tell him that Renfield escaped again and attacked two men carrying boxes of earth from Carfax. Van Helsing surrounds his dying patient with garlic, but she pushes the flowers away as she sleeps. When Seward checks on Lucy during the night, he notices a bat hovering near her window. On the morning of September 20, the wounds on Lucy\u2019s neck disappear. Sensing that Lucy is nearing the end of her life, the doctors awaken Holmwood and bring him to say good-bye. In a strangely seductive voice, Lucy begs Holmwood to kiss her, but Van Helsing pulls him away, instructing him to kiss Lucy only on the forehead. Holmwood complies with Van Helsing\u2019s instructions, and Lucy dies, recovering in death the beauty that she lost during her long illness.  Chapter XIII  Seward\u2019s diary continues, as he describes Lucy\u2019s burial. Before the funeral, Van Helsing covers the coffin and body with garlic and places a crucifix in Lucy\u2019s mouth. He tells a confused Seward that after the funeral, they must cut off Lucy\u2019s head and take out her heart. The next day, however, Van Helsing discovers that someone has stolen the crucifix from the body and tells Seward that they will have to wait before doing anything more. The heartbroken Holmwood\u2014referred to as Lord Godalming since his father\u2019s death\u2014turns to Seward for consolation. Looking at Lucy\u2019s unnaturally lovely corpse, Holmwood cannot believe she is really dead. Van Helsing asks Holmwood for Lucy\u2019s personal papers, hoping that they will provide some clue as to the cause of her death. Meanwhile, Mina writes in her diary that in London she and Jonathan have seen a tall, fierce man with a black mustache and beard. Jonathan is convinced the man is Count Dracula. Jonathan becomes so upset that he slips into a deep sleep and remembers nothing when he wakes. Mina decides that, for the sake of her husband\u2019s health, she must read his diary entries from his time in Transylvania.  That night, Mina receives a telegram informing her of Lucy\u2019s death. This message is followed by an excerpt from a local paper, which reports that a number of children have been temporarily abducted in Hampstead Heath\u2014the area where Lucy was buried\u2014by a strange woman whom the children call the \u201cBloofer Lady.\u201d When the children return home, they bear strange wounds on their necks.  Chapter XIV  Transcribing her husband\u2019s journal, Mina is horrified by its contents. When Van Helsing visits Mina in order to discuss the events leading up to Lucy\u2019s death, she is so impressed that she gives him Jonathan\u2019s diary to read. Van Helsing reads the diary and returns to see the couple at breakfast the next day. Van Helsing\u2019s belief in Jonathan\u2019s observations restores the young man\u2019s memories of his time in Transylvania. Realizing that Dracula must indeed have journeyed to England, Harker begins a new diary.<PARAGRAPH>Seward reports that Renfield has returned to his habit of catching flies and spiders. Van Helsing visits the young doctor and points out the newspaper accounts of the \u201cBloofer Lady,\u201d taking care to note that the abducted children always reappear with wounds on their necks similar to those that appeared on Lucy\u2019s neck. Seward is skeptical of any connection, but his mentor urges him to believe in the possibility of the supernatural\u2014of occurrences that cannot be explained by reason. Van Helsing suddenly concludes that it must be Lucy who is responsible for the marks on the children\u2019s necks.", "analysis": "Chapters XII\u2013XIV  In this section, we witness Lucy\u2019s transformation into a super-natural creature. The description of her death immediately alerts us that she has crossed into the realm of the supernatural: the wounds on her neck disappear and all of her \u201cloveliness [comes] back to her in death.\u201d The clippings about the threatening \u201cBloofer Lady\u201d make it clear that Lucy has indeed become a vampire. Dracula\u2019s attack has transformed a model of English chastity and purity into an openly sexual predator. When Holmwood visits Lucy for the last time, her physical appeal startles him: \u201cshe looked her best, with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes.\u201d Equally startling is the newfound forwardness with which she demands sexual satisfaction: \u201cArthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!\u201d Dracula\u2019s power has indeed topped one former example of the Victorian female ideal. Lucy\u2019s body also becomes a metaphorical battleground between the forces of good and evil, between the forces for liberation and repression of female sexuality. While Dracula fights for control of Lucy, through whom he believes he can access many Englishmen, Van Helsing\u2019s crew pumps her full of brave men\u2019s blood, which they believe is the \u201cbest thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble.\u201d This battle reflects the struggle of Victorian society to recognize and accept female sexuality. Victorian England prized women for their docility and domesticity, leaving them no room for open expression of sexual desire, even within the confines of marriage. Mina, though married, appears no less chaste than Lucy. This obsession with purity was pervasive: less than twenty years before the publication of Dracula, medical authorities still believed that a menstruating woman could spoil meat simply by touching it. Van Helsing articulates these prejudices of the Victorian age as he praises Mina\u2019s character, saying: She is one of God\u2019s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an egoist\u2014and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so skeptical and selfish.\u201d  Van Helsing\u2019s statement implies that a woman who cannot manage this much truth, sweetness, nobility, and modesty has no place in Victorian society. Though Lucy possesses all of these in plenty, she also betrays a fatal flaw: her openness to sexual adventure. Recalling Van Helsing\u2019s lesson in vampire lore, we know that Dracula is powerless to enter a home unless invited. The count thus would not have been able to access Lucy\u2019s bedroom unless she invited him in. Though no character ever blames Lucy for her susceptibility to seduction\u2014or even mentions it\u2014we are aware that the young woman has fallen from grace. Victorian society firmly dictated that wantonness came at a high price, and in Dracula, Lucy pays dearly.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210120133206/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/dracula/section6/"}
