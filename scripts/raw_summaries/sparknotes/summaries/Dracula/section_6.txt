{"name": "Chapters XV\u2013XVIII", "summary": "Chapter XV  Seward is appalled by Van Helsing\u2019s suggestion that Lucy is in some way responsible for the rash of wounded children. However, due to his respect for the elder doctor, he accompanies Van Helsing on his investigation. The two men visit one of the wounded children and find that the marks on the child\u2019s neck are identical to Lucy\u2019s. That night, Seward and Van Helsing proceed to Lucy\u2019s tomb, open the coffin, and find it empty. Seward suggests that a grave robber might have taken the corpse, but Van Helsing instructs him to keep watch at one side of the churchyard. Near dawn, Seward witnesses a \u201cwhite streak\u201d moving between the trees. He and Van Helsing approach and find a child lying nearby, but Seward still refuses to believe that Lucy is responsible for any wrongdoing. Only after they return to Lucy\u2019s tomb, finding her restored to her coffin and \u201cradiantly beautiful,\u201d does Seward feel the \u201chorrid sense of the reality of things.\u201d Van Helsing explains that Lucy belongs to the \u201cUn-Dead\u201d and insists that she must be decapitated, her mouth filled with garlic, and a stake driven through her heart. The two men meet with Arthur Holmwood and Quincey Morris, and Van Helsing explains what must be done. Holmwood is opposed to mutilating his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s corpse, but finally agrees to accompany them to the graveyard.  Chapter XVI That night, the four men go to Lucy\u2019s grave and find it empty. Van Helsing seals the door of the tomb with Communion wafers to prevent the vampire Lucy from reentering. The men then hide in wait. Eventually, a figure appears, dressed entirely in white and carrying a child. It is Lucy\u2014or rather, a monster that looks like Lucy, with eyes \u201cunclean and full of hell-fire\u201d and a mouth stained with fresh blood. As the men surround her, she drops the child and calls out passionately to Holmwood, telling him to come to her. Holmwood begins to move, but Van Helsing leaps between the couple and brandishes a crucifix. Lucy recoils. Van Helsing quickly removes the Communion wafers, and the vampire slips through the door of her tomb. Having witnessed this horror, Holmwood concurs that the necessary rites must be performed, and the following evening, he returns to hammer a stake through Lucy\u2019s heart. As Lucy returns to a state of beauty, Van Helsing reassures Holmwood that he has saved Lucy\u2019s soul from eternal darkness and has given her peace at last. Before leaving the tomb, Van Helsing makes plans to reunite with the men two nights later, so that they may discuss the \u201cterrible task\u201d before them.  Chapter XVII  At Van Helsing\u2019s urging, Jonathan and Mina Harker come to stay with Seward at the asylum. Mina transcribes Seward\u2019s diary with the typewriter and notes its account of Lucy\u2019s death. Meanwhile, Seward reads the Harkers\u2019 journals, realizing for the first time that Dracula may well be his next-door neighbor and that there may be a connection between the vampire\u2019s proximity and Renfield\u2019s behavior. The lunatic Renfield is calm at the moment, and Seward wonders what this tranquility indicates about Dracula\u2019s whereabouts.  Meanwhile, Jonathan researches the boxes of earth that were shipped from Transylvania to England. He discovers that all fifty were delivered to the chapel at Carfax, but worries that some might have been moved elsewhere in recent weeks. Mina notes that Harker seems to have fully recovered from his ordeal in Transylvania. Holmwood and Morris arrive at the asylum, and, clearly, Holmwood is still terribly shaken by Lucy\u2019s death.<PARAGRAPH> Chapter XVIII  With Seward\u2019s permission, Mina visits Renfield. The madman frantically swallows his collection of flies and spiders before she enters, but is extremely polite and seems rational in her presence. Van Helsing arrives at the asylum. Pleased to see that Seward\u2019s diaries and letters have been typed and placed in order, he compliments Mina on her work but hopes that she will be spared a role in the business before them. The destruction of the vampire, he notes, is \u201cno part for a woman.\u201d Van Helsing gathers the entire company and tells them the legend of the nosferatu, or \u201cUn-Dead.\u201d He says that such creatures are immortal and immensely strong; have command over various animals and the elements; and can vanish and change form at will. However, they also have certain weaknesses: they cannot survive without blood; cannot enter a house unless summoned; lose their power at daybreak, at which time they must seek shelter in the earth or a coffin; and are powerless before crucifixes, Communion wafers, and other holy objects. To kill Dracula, Van Helsing says they must first track down his fifty boxes of earth. He also resolves that Mina must not be burdened with or endangered by the details of their work. The men tell Mina that they \u201care men and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope.\u201d The entire company asks to see Renfield. They gather, and he makes a remarkably rational and passionate plea to be released at once in order to avoid terrible consequences. Fearing that this sudden display of sanity is but \u201canother form or phase of his madness,\u201d Seward denies Renfield\u2019s request.", "analysis": "Chapters XV\u2013XVIII In this section, Lucy\u2019s transformation reaches its terrible end. Lucy is now a perversion of the two most sacred female virtues in Victorian England: maternalism and sexual purity. In Chapter XVII, Mina voices an expectation of Victorian culture when she writes, \u201cWe women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked.\u201d Like the three women Harker meets in Dracula\u2019s castle, the undead Lucy counters this \u201cmother-spirit\u201d by preying on innocent children. Rather than providing them with nourishment and protection, she stalks and feeds on them. The hideous transformation of this once beautiful woman into a demonic child-killer demonstrates the anxiety the Victorians felt about women whose sexual behavior challenged convention. Van Helsing\u2019s band of do-gooders feels this same anxiety about female sexuality as they face off against its hypersexualized opponent. As the men confront Lucy, whose purity has changed to \u201cvoluptuous wantonness,\u201d we note the rather limited vocabulary Stoker uses to paint the scene. Lucy is described almost exclusively in terms of her sexuality: her face becomes \u201cwreathed with a voluptuous smile,\u201d and she advances with \u201coutstretched arms and a wanton smile.\u201d Lucy\u2019s words to Holmwood echo her dying wish for his kiss: \u201cCome to me, Arthur. . . . My arms are hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!\u201d Her words are both a plea for and a promise of sexual satisfaction. Van Helsing and his crew\u2019s response to Lucy\u2019s words illustrate that the men are certainly aware of the words\u2019 double meaning. The men are equally attracted to and horrified by the woman who would make such a bold proposition: \u201cThere was something diabolically sweet in her tones . . . which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms.\u201d Dracula\u2019s power is indeed considerable, as it tempts even morally righteous men who are aware of the count\u2019s diabolical plans. Tempted as the men are by Lucy\u2019s carnal embrace, they are equally eager to destroy her. Throughout the descriptions of Lucy\u2019s voluptuousness runs a strong indication of the men\u2019s desire to annihilate her. Dr. Seward writes, \u201c[T]he remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have done it with savage delight.\u201d Having paid for sexual curiosity with her eternal soul, Lucy must now pay an equally steep price for her sexual appetite.<PARAGRAPH>The act of Lucy\u2019s final destruction strongly resembles an act of sexual congress. Holmwood\u2019s piercing of Lucy with his stake unmistakably suggests intercourse: her body \u201cshook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions. . . . But Arthur never faltered . . . driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake.\u201d Holmwood\u2019s attack restores Lucy\u2019s purity and soul, thus implying that Holmwood returns Lucy to the socially desirable state of monogamy and submission. As her fianc\u00e9, Holmwood cleanses the \u201ccarnal and unspiritual\u201d from Lucy by consummating a sexual relationship that, without Dracula\u2019s interference, would have not only been consecrated by God, but also would have legitimized Lucy\u2019s troublesome sexual desires.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210120133206/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/dracula/section7/"}
