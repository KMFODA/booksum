{"name": "Part 3 (continued)", "summary": "Marlow\u2019s return to Brussels through the conclusion.  Part 3 Marlow barely survives his illness. Eventually he returns to the \u201csepulchral city,\u201d Brussels. He resents the people there for their petty self-importance and smug complacency. His aunt nurses him back to health, but his disorder is more emotional than physical. A bespectacled representative of the Company comes to retrieve the packet of papers Kurtz entrusted to Marlow, but Marlow will give him only the pamphlet on the \u201cSuppression of Savage Customs,\u201d with the postscript (the handwritten \u201cExterminate all the brutes!\u201d) torn off. The man threatens legal action to obtain the rest of the packet\u2019s contents. Another man, calling himself Kurtz\u2019s cousin, appears and takes some letters to the family. The cousin tells him that Kurtz had been a great musician, although he does not elaborate further. Marlow and the cousin ponder Kurtz\u2019s myriad talents and decide that he is best described as a \u201cuniversal genius.\u201d A journalist colleague of Kurtz\u2019s appears and takes the pamphlet for publication. This man believes Kurtz\u2019s true skills were in popular or extremist politics. Finally, Marlow is left with only a few letters and a picture of Kurtz\u2019s Intended. Marlow goes to see her without really knowing why. Kurtz\u2019s memory comes flooding back to him as he stands on her doorstep. He finds the Intended still in mourning, though it has been over a year since Kurtz\u2019s death. He gives her the packet, and she asks if he knew Kurtz well. He replies that he knew him as well as it is possible for one man to know another. His presence fulfills her need for a sympathetic ear, and she continually praises Kurtz. Her sentimentality begins to anger Marlow, but he holds back his annoyance until it gives way to pity. She says she will mourn Kurtz forever, and asks Marlow to repeat his last words to give her something upon which to sustain herself. Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz\u2019s last word was her name. She responds that she was certain that this was the case. Marlow ends his story here, and the narrator looks off into the dark sky, which makes the waterway seem \u201cto lead into the heart of an immense darkness.\u201d Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Part 3\u00a0\u2192 Analysis Marlow\u2019s series of encounters with persons from Kurtz\u2019s former life makes him question the value he places on his memories of Kurtz. Kurtz\u2019s cousin and the journalist both offer a version of Kurtz that seems not to resemble the man Marlow knew. Kurtz, in fact, seems to have been all things to all people\u2014someone who has changed their life and now serves as a kind of symbolic figure presiding over their existence. This makes Marlow\u2019s own experience of Kurtz less unique and thus perhaps less meaningful. The fact that he shares Kurtz with all of these overconfident, self-important people, most of whom will never leave Brussels, causes Kurtz to seem common, and less profound. In reality, Marlow\u2019s stream of visitors do not raise any new issues: in their excessive praise of Kurtz and their own lack of perspective, they resemble the Russian trader, who also took Kurtz as a kind of guru. Marlow goes to see Kurtz\u2019s Intended in a state of profound uncertainty. He is unsure whether his version of Kurtz has any value either as a reflection of reality or as a philosophical construct. In response to the woman\u2019s simple question as to whether he knew Kurtz well, he can only reply that he knew him \u201c\u2018as well as it is possible for one man to know another.\u2019\u201d Given what the preceding narrative has shown about the possibilities for \u201cknowing\u201d another person in any meaningful sense, the reader can easily see that Marlow\u2019s reply to Kurtz\u2019s Intended is a qualification, not an affirmation: Marlow barely knows himself. By the end of Marlow\u2019s visit with the woman, the reader is also aware, even if Marlow is not, that the kinds of illusions and untruths which Marlow accuses women of perpetuating are in fact not dissimilar from those fictions men use to understand their own experiences and justify such things as colonialism. Marlow has much more in common with Kurtz\u2019s Intended than he would like to admit. Kurtz\u2019s Intended, like Marlow\u2019s aunt and Kurtz\u2019s mistress, is a problematic female figure. Marlow praises her for her \u201cmature capacity for fidelity, for belief, for suffering,\u201d suggesting that the most valuable traits in a woman are passive. Conrad\u2019s portrayal of the Intended has thus been criticized for having misogynist overtones, and there is some justification for this point of view. She is a repository of conservative ideas about what it means to be white and European, upholding fine-sounding but ultimately useless notions of heroism and romance.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210117001738/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heart-of-darkness/section11/"}
