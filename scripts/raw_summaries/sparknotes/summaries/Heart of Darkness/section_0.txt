{"name": "Part 1", "summary": "Beginning through Marlow\u2019s being hired as a steamboat captain.  Part 1 At sundown, a pleasure ship called the Nellie lies anchored at the mouth of the Thames, waiting for the tide to go out. Five men relax on the deck of the ship: the Director of Companies, who is also the captain and host, the Lawyer, the Accountant, Marlow, and the unnamed Narrator. The five men, old friends held together by \u201cthe bond of the sea,\u201d are restless yet meditative, as if waiting for something to happen. As darkness begins to fall, and the scene becomes \u201cless brilliant but more profound,\u201d the men recall the great men and ships that have set forth from the Thames on voyages of trade and exploration, frequently never to return. Suddenly Marlow remarks that this very spot was once \u201cone of the dark places of the earth.\u201d He notes that when the Romans first came to England, it was a great, savage wilderness to them. He imagines what it must have been like for a young Roman captain or soldier to come to a place so far from home and lacking in comforts. This train of thought reminds Marlow of his sole experience as a \u201cfresh-water sailor,\u201d when as a young man he captained a steamship going up the Congo River. He recounts that he first got the idea when, after returning from a six-year voyage through Asia, he came across a map of Africa in a London shop window, which reinvigorated his childhood fantasies about the \u201cblank spaces\u201d on the map. Marlow recounts how he obtained a job with the Belgian \u201cCompany\u201d that trades on the Congo River (the Congo was then a Belgian territory) through the influence of an aunt who had friends in the Company\u2019s administration. The Company was eager to send Marlow to Africa, because one of the Company\u2019s steamer captains had recently been killed in a scuffle with the natives. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Part 1\u00a0\u2192 Analysis Marlow\u2019s story of a voyage up the Congo River that he took as a young man is the main narrative of Heart of Darkness. Marlow\u2019s narrative is framed by another narrative, in which one of the listeners to Marlow\u2019s story explains the circumstances in which Marlow tells it. The narrator who begins Heart of Darkness is unnamed, as are the other three listeners, who are identified only by their professional occupations. Moreover, the narrator usually speaks in the first-person plural, describing what all four of Marlow\u2019s listeners think and feel. The unanimity and anonymity of Marlow\u2019s listeners combine to create the impression that they represent conventional perspectives and values of the British establishment. For the narrator and his fellow travelers, the Thames conjures up images of famous British explorers who have set out from that river on glorious voyages. The narrator recounts the achievements of these explorers in a celebratory tone, calling them \u201cknight-errants\u201d of the sea, implying that such voyages served a sacred, higher purpose. The narrator\u2019s attitude is that these men promoted the glory of Great Britain, expanded knowledge of the globe, and contributed to the civilization and enlightenment of the rest of the planet. At the time Heart of Darkness was written, the British Empire was at its peak, and Britain controlled colonies and dependencies all over the planet. The popular saying that \u201cthe sun never sets on the British Empire\u201d was literally true. The main topic of Heart of Darkness is imperialism, a nation\u2019s policy of exerting influence over other areas through military, political, and economic coercion. The narrator expresses the mainstream belief that imperialism is a glorious and worthy enterprise. Indeed, in Conrad\u2019s time, \u201cempire\u201d was one of the central values of British subjects, the fundamental term through which Britain defined its identity and sense of purpose.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210117001738/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heart-of-darkness/section1/"}
