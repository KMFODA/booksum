{"name": "Dedication", "summary": "Summary  Machiavelli\u2019s dedication of The Prince\u2014with the heading \u201cNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli to the Magnificent Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici\u201d\u2014is a letter to Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, who was the nephew of Giovanni de\u2019 Medici (Leo X) and became duke of Urbino in 1516. Machiavelli offers his book with customary humility, commenting that it is stylistically simple and unworthy of his audience. Machiavelli describes his book as a summary of his \u201cunderstanding of the deeds of great men,\u201d intended to help Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici achieve eminence as a prince. Analysis  Machiavelli begins by offering a short defense of why he, an ordinary citizen, should know more than rulers about the art of ruling. He uses a metaphor to justify himself: a person standing on a mountain is best positioned to survey the landscape below, and a person standing below is best positioned to survey the mountain. Similarly, writes Machiavelli, \u201cto comprehend fully the nature of people, one must be a prince, and to comprehend fully the nature of princes one must be an ordinary citizen.\u201d Implicit in this claim is the idea that the removed perspective of an observer is a more reliable guide than practical experience, and a better means of improving the art of ruling. The dedication gives the reader an idea of Machiavelli\u2019s intended audience. Though the book has a scholarly tone, it is not for fellow scholars. The Prince is meant to advise, instruct, and influence the minds of rulers. It was, originally, a kind of practical \u201chow-to\u201d guide for aspiring princes. Only later did The Prince become regarded as an important treatise on political philosophy.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210303115306/https://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/prince/section1/"}
