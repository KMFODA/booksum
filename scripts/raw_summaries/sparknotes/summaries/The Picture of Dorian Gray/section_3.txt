{"name": "Chapters Seven\u2013Eight", "summary": "Chapter Seven The theater is crowded when the men arrive. Dorian continues to wax eloquent about Sibyl\u2019s beauty, and Basil assures Dorian that he will support the marriage wholeheartedly since Dorian is so obviously in love. When the play begins, however, Sibyl is terrible, and her acting only worsens as the evening wears on. Unable to understand the change that has come over his beloved, Dorian is heartbroken. Basil and Lord Henry leave him, and he makes his way backstage to find Sibyl, who is quite happy despite her dreadful performance. She explains that before she met Dorian and experienced true love, she was able to inhabit other characters and feel their emotions easily, which made possible her success as an actress. Now, however, these pretend emotions no longer interest her, since they pale in relation to her real feelings for Dorian. She realizes that \u201cthe words I had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to say.\u201d As a result, she declares that her career on the stage is over. Dorian, horrified by this decision, realizes that he was in love not with her but with her acting. He spurns her cruelly and tells her that he wishes never to see her again. After a night spent wandering the streets of London, Dorian returns to his home. There, he looks at Basil\u2019s portrait of him and notices the painting has changed\u2014a faint sneer has appeared at the corner of his likeness\u2019s mouth. He is astonished. Remembering his wish that the painting would bear the burden and marks of age and lifestyle for him, Dorian is suddenly overcome with shame about his behavior toward Sibyl. He pulls a screen in front of the portrait and goes to bed, resolving to make amends with Sibyl in the morning.  Chapter Eight Dorian does not awake until well after noon the next day. When he gets up, he goes to check the painting. In the light, the change is unmistakable; the face in the portrait has become crueler. While the stunned Dorian tries to come up with some rational explanation for the change, Lord Henry arrives with terrible news: Sibyl committed suicide the previous night. Dorian is stunned, but Lord Henry manages to convince him that he should not go to the police and explain his part in the girl\u2019s death. Lord Henry urges Dorian not to wallow in guilt but, rather, to regard Sibyl\u2019s suicide as a perfect artistic representation of undying love and appreciate it as such. Dorian, who feels numb rather than anguished, is convinced by his friend\u2019s seductive words and agrees to go to the opera with him that very night. When Lord Henry is gone, Dorian reflects that this incident is a turning point in his existence, and he resolves to accept a life of \u201c[e]ternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joy and wilder sins,\u201d in which his portrait, rather than his own body, will bear the marks of age and experience. Having made this resolution, he joins Lord Henry at the opera.", "analysis": "Chapters Seven\u2013Eight Dorian\u2019s romance with Sibyl represents the possibility that he will not accept Lord Henry\u2019s philosophy and will instead learn to prize human beings and emotions over art. His love for her allows him to resist Lord Henry\u2019s seductive words, noting to Lord Henry, \u201cWhen I am with her, I regret all that you have taught me. . . . [T]he mere touch of Sibyl Vane\u2019s hand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous, delightful theories.\u201d But just as Lord Henry appreciates Dorian as a work of art rather than as a human being, what Dorian values most about Sibyl is her talent as an actress\u2014her ability to portray an ideal, not her true self. The extent of Lord Henry\u2019s influence is painfully clear as Dorian heartlessly snubs Sibyl, who claims that her real love for him prohibits her from acting out such emotions onstage. Surely, to modern readers, Sibyl\u2019s devotion to Dorian\u2014not to mention her grief over losing him\u2014seems a bit melodramatic. She is a rather thinly drawn character, but she serves two important functions. First, she forces us to question what precisely art is and when its effects are good. Second, she shows the pernicious consequences of a philosophy that places beauty and self-pleasure above consideration for others. Sibyl\u2019s tragic fate enables us to be as critical of Wilde\u2019s philosophies as he himself was at the end of his life. Sibyl\u2019s claim that Dorian gives her \u201csomething higher, something of which all art is but a reflection\u201d stands in undeniable contrast to Lord Henry\u2019s philosophy, in which art is the highest experience and life imitates art rather than vice versa. Indeed, time and again, Lord Henry delights in ignoring the significance of human emotions. Even though Sibyl\u2019s conception of art as a reflection of grand emotions counters Lord Henry\u2019s (and Wilde\u2019s) philosophy of art, it resonates throughout the remainder of the novel. Indeed, Sibyl\u2019s philosophy is echoed in the very portrait of Dorian, since it is a reflection of Dorian\u2019s true self. The answer to the narrator\u2019s question as to whether the changing portrait \u201c[w]ould \u2026 teach [Dorian] to loathe his own soul\u201d is yes, as Dorian grows increasingly uncomfortable over the course of the novel with what the disfigured portrait signifies about himself. As the novel progresses and the painting continues to register the effects of time and dissipation, we see the degree to which Dorian is undone by the sins that his portrait reflects and the degree to which he suffers for allowing the painting to act as a \u201cvisible emblem of conscience.\u201d The aging of Dorian\u2019s likeness in the portrait ultimately contradicts some of Lord Henry\u2019s\u2014and Wilde\u2019s\u2014beliefs about art: the painting does not exist in a moral vacuum. Instead, the painting both shows the deleterious effects of sin and gives Dorian a sense of freedom from morality; it thus influences and is influenced by morality.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210228142327/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doriangray/section4/"}
