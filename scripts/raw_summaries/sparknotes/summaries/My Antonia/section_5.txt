{"name": "Book III, Chapters I\u2013IV", "summary": "Chapter I At the university, Jim comes under the influence of a young scholar named Gaston Cleric. He takes rooms with an elderly couple on the edge of Lincoln and quickly becomes engrossed in his studies. During the summer, he remains in Lincoln to study Greek under the terms of his enrollment.  Chapter II One evening, during the spring of his sophomore year, Jim is deep in thought when someone knocks at his door. He is slow to recognize his visitor, but soon realizes that it is Lena Lingard, dressed in her city finery. She explains to him that she has set up in Lincoln as a dressmaker, and she describes the details of her business affairs. When Jim asks after \u00c1ntonia, Lena explains that \u00c1ntonia has taken up work with Mrs. Gardener at the hotel and is engaged to Larry Donovan. Jim greets this news with a mixture of pleasure and dismay, and he mentions an urge to go home and take care of her. Lena changes the subject to the theater, and Jim asks if she would like to get together for a theater outing in the near future. Lena agrees to this proposal and departs as quickly as she has come, leaving Jim among his books in the solitude of his study.  Chapter III Throughout the spring, Jim and Lena attend a series of plays together. One play in particular, Camille, the story of a man\u2019s love for a woman dying of tuberculosis, affects them both very strongly.  Chapter IV In addition to spending time with Lena at the theater, Jim visits her regularly at her dressmaking shop and takes Sunday breakfasts with her at her apartment. As the weeks wear on, Jim becomes less interested in his classes and spends more and more time hanging about with Lena and her circle. Near the end of the academic term, Cleric informs Jim that he has accepted an instructorship at Harvard College and wants Jim to accompany him east. After receiving the blessing of his grandfather, Jim resolves to leave Lincoln, and he visits Lena to tell her his decision. While sad to hear the news, she makes no attempt to hold him back. When the term ends, Jim returns home to be with his grandparents for a few weeks. He then makes a visit to his relatives in Virginia before joining Cleric in Boston.", "analysis": "Book III, Chapters I\u2013IV Book III reflects another major narrative shift in the novel: Jim\u2019s transition to college. Although Jim\u2019s move from the farm to Black Hawk\u2014the break separating Books I and II\u2014makes for a change of scenery, his sense of place is still firmly rooted in the nearby countryside that he roamed as a boy. But with his entry into the university at Lincoln in Book III, a more permanent rift between his past and his present begins to establish itself. Jim\u2019s initial impulse is to reject the lure of \u201cimpersonal\u201d scholarship in favor of his \u201cown naked land and the figures scattered upon it.\u201d He finds himself torn between study and memory, excited by the lure of learning new forms, but at the same time plunged back into thoughts of his past. In the face of the new, Jim finds the old people and ways \u201cstrengthened and simplified,\u201d though it is unclear whether such an improvement is more a virtue of the past itself or a result of thinking about the past in a new way. In either event, the nostalgia that Jim begins to feel at the university is extremely intense, and it begins to hamper his ability to live in the present. The people that he carries with him in his mind are so alive to him that he \u201cscarcely stopped to wonder whether they were alive anywhere else, or how.\u201d \u00c1ntonia soon comes to display a similar tendency to live in the past at the expense of her present.<PARAGRAPH>The idea that takes hold of Jim most strongly in the course of his study is the concept of patria, or loyalty to one\u2019s specific place of origin, a concept prominent in the works of the renowned Latin poet Virgil. The heart of My \u00c1ntonia lies not in its existence as an American novel, or even as a novel of the American Midwest, but rather as a fictionalized document of childhood in a town like Cather\u2019s own Red Cloud, Nebraska. The devotion that Cather, and by extension Jim, feels is not for the cosmopolitan present in which they are immersed but rather for the provincial countryside of their youth, which they carry in their hearts always. Jim\u2019s complete separation of his Lincoln world from his Black Hawk world is undermined by the visit he receives from Lena Lingard. She acts as a link between his past and his present and continues to stand in \u00c1ntonia\u2019s place as an object of his desire. Jim\u2019s relationship with Lena is curiously sterile; although he spends a great deal of time with her, their interaction is rarely charged with the same quality of emotional intensity as his earlier interactions with \u00c1ntonia are. With the security of his childhood and his early family life slipping away from him, Jim finds himself in an aimless and unhappy state. Cather makes use of a play (Camille) within the novel to illustrate Jim\u2019s mood, presenting his wistful perspective in the middle of a particularly wrenching theatergoing experience. As he watches the tragic story told in Camille unfold, Jim feels \u201chelpless to prevent the closing of that chapter of idyllic love\u201d in which the protagonist\u2019s \u201cineffable happiness was only to be the measure of his fall.\u201d The unhappy fate of the drama\u2019s male character is Jim\u2019s fate as well, and Cather suggests that art itself is of value as a reflection of our own emotions and experiences. Jim marvels at the power of art to get at such universal truths \u201cacross long years and several languages,\u201d but at the same time he reveals his own subjective bias about art\u2019s meaning, asserting that \u201cwhenever and wherever that piece is put on, it is April.\u201d The play has crystallized for him a certain emotion that he associates with April, but in linking the play automatically to this emotion, he potentially limits the breadth of his actual experience.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126021927/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/antonia/section6/"}
