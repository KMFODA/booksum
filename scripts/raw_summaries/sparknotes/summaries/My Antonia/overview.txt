Jim makes fast friends with the Shimerda children, especially \u00c1ntonia, who is nearest to him in age and eager to learn English. Jim tutors \u00c1ntonia, and the two of them spend much of the autumn exploring their new landscape together.\nIn late January, tragedy strikes with the suicide of Mr. Shimerda. After an emotional funeral, the Shimerdas retreat into despair, and the Burdens struggle to be as accommodating as possible. As a result of the hardships that the Shimerdas suffer, \u00c1ntonia and Jim find that a wedge has been driven between them.\nA couple of years later, the Burdens decide to move into town, and shortly thereafter \u00c1ntonia takes a job as a housekeeper with a neighboring family, the Harlings.
