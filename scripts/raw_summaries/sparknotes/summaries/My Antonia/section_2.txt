{"name": "My \u00c1ntonia Book I, Chapters XIV\u2013XIX", "summary": "Book I, Chapters XIV\u2013XIX  If I live here, like you, that is different. Things will be easy for you. But they will be hard for us. (See Important Quotations Explained)   Chapter XIV On the second morning of the blizzard, Jim wakes to a great commotion. When he arrives in the kitchen, his grandfather informs him that Mr. Shimerda is dead. With Ambrosch Shimerda curled up on a nearby bench, the Burdens quietly discuss the apparent suicide as they eat breakfast. Jake describes Krajiek\u2019s strange behavior around the body and notes that Krajiek\u2019s axe fits the gash in Mr. Shimerda\u2019s face. Otto Fuchs and Mrs. Burden talk him out of his suspicions. After the meal, Otto sets out to summon the priest and the coroner from Black Hawk, and the others clear the road for the trip to the Shimerdas. Jim stays behind and finds himself alone. After completing a few chores, he settles down to contemplate Mr. Shimerda\u2019s death. At dusk, the wagon returns, and Jake describes the scene at the Shimerdas\u2019 to Jim.  Chapter XV The next day, Otto returns from Black Hawk with a young Bohemian named Anton Jelinek. At dinner, Jelinek bemoans the fact that no priest could be found to put Mr. Shimerda to rest. Afterward, Jelinek goes out to clear a road to the Shimerdas\u2019 wide enough for a wagon, and Otto begins to construct a coffin. Later in the afternoon, a number of other locals stop at the Burdens\u2019 to ask after the Shimerdas and discuss the tragedy. The coroner refrains from issuing a warrant for Krajiek at Mr. Burden\u2019s urging. The postmaster alerts the Burdens that none of the graveyards in the area will accept Mr. Shimerda because he killed himself, and Mrs. Burden lashes out in bitterness at this unfairness. With no graveyard to turn to, the Shimerdas decide that they will bury Mr. Shimerda on the corner of their homestead.  Chapter XVI After lying dead in the barn for four days, Mr. Shimerda is finally buried on his own land. Despite the beginnings of another ominous snowfall, rural neighbors come from miles around to attend the burial. At Mrs. Shimerda\u2019s request, Mr. Burden says a prayer in English for Mr. Shimerda, and afterward Otto leads the assembled group in a hymn.  Chapter XVII With the coming of spring, the neighbors help the Shimerdas to build a new log house on their property, and they eventually acquire a new windmill and some livestock. One day, after giving an English lesson to Yulka, Jim asks \u00c1ntonia if she would like to attend the upcoming term at the schoolhouse. \u00c1ntonia proudly refuses, saying that she is kept too busy by farm work, but her tears of sorrow reveal her true feelings on the matter. Jim stays at the Shimerdas\u2019 for supper, but he is offended by their ingratitude over neighborly charity and by \u00c1ntonia\u2019s coarse manners.  Chapter XVIII Once school starts, Jim sees less and less of \u00c1ntonia, and soon tension erupts between them. When Jake and Jim ride over to the Shimerdas\u2019 to collect a loaned horse collar, Ambrosch first denies borrowing it, then returns with a badly damaged collar he rudely gives over to them. After a heated exchange, Jake grabs Ambrosch, who kicks him in the stomach. Jake then pounds Ambrosch on the head. Jake and Jim quickly pull away from the Shimerdas\u2019, as Mrs. Shimerda yells after them about sending for the authorities. When Mr. Burden learns of the incident, he sends Jake into town with a ten-dollar bill to pay the assault fine. For the next few weeks, the Shimerdas are proud and aloof when meeting the Burdens in passing, although they maintain their respect for Mr. Burden. Finally Mr. Burden arranges a reconciliation by hiring Ambrosch to help with his wheat threshing and offering \u00c1ntonia a job to help Mrs. Burden in the kitchen. In addition, he forgives Mrs. Shimerda her debt on the milk cow she bought from him. In an effort to show her own forgiveness, Mrs. Shimerda knits Jake a pair of socks.<PARAGRAPH> Chapter XIX In high summer, \u00c1ntonia and Jim spend more time together, walking to the garden each morning to collect vegetables for dinner. One night, during an electric storm in a light rain, \u00c1ntonia and Jim climb onto the roof of the chicken house to stare at the sky until they are called down for supper. \u00c1ntonia tells Jim that things will be easy for him but hard for her family.", "analysis": "Book I, Chapters XIV\u2013XIX Throughout the novel, Jim shows an extraordinary capacity to identify with others, and, upon hearing of Mr. Shimerda\u2019s apparent suicide, he immediately senses that \u201cit was homesickness that had killed Mr. Shimerda.\u201d As Jim imagines the homeward route of Mr. Shimerda\u2019s released spirit through Chicago and Virginia, two way stations on his own journey to Nebraska, he identifies with the sense of loss that he believes caused Mr. Shimerda such disenchantment. In meditating on Mr. Shimerda\u2019s life, Jim comes to feel as though his memories almost \u201cmight have been Mr. Shimerda\u2019s memories.\u201d Jim\u2019s most concentrated struggle with cultural difference occurs over the matter of religion. As Jake describes Ambrosch\u2019s view that his father has been sent to purgatory as a result of his suicide, Jim rails against what is to him an incomprehensible stance, saying, \u201cI almost know it isn\u2019t true.\u201d But the \u201calmost\u201d indicates Jim\u2019s hesitation. Because he himself holds a belief that is mystical (his belief in the presence of Mr. Shimerda\u2019s soul), Jim is unable to rule out the seemingly unsupportable beliefs of others. As he attempts to sleep that night, Jim is crushingly preoccupied with this unfamiliar idea of purgatory, suggesting that his confrontation with other ways of thinking has left him uncomfortable. Although Jim listens carefully to Anton Jelinek\u2019s story of religious conviction and finds it \u201cimpossible not to admire his frank, manly faith,\u201d there is clearly a divide between the Bohemians\u2019 more instinctual faith and Jim\u2019s more philosophical spirituality. The Nebraska prairie, as an amalgam of various immigrant groups, is a testing ground for collisions between such differing religious viewpoints. Mr. Shimerda\u2019s suicide proves to be a test case for the solidarity of the farming community. When the old-guard religions universally refuse to have a suicide buried in their graveyards, the Shimerdas are forced to come up with an alternative. In dismis-sing the conservative standards of the foreign churches, Mrs. Burden proposes \u201can American graveyard that will be more liberal minded.\u201d This American graveyard is a burial plot on the family land, accompanied by a makeshift funeral and an improvised service conducted by the farming community. For all of its unorthodoxy, the beauty of this service captures Jim\u2019s imagination, as he remarks on his affection for \u201cthe dim superstition\u201d of the event and the \u201cpropitiatory intent\u201d of the grave that remains behind it. With Mr. Shimerda departed, the different paths that await \u00c1ntonia and Jim begin to emerge. Structurally, this chapter concludes Book I, the main phase of Jim and \u00c1ntonia\u2019s relationship in the rural countryside. The directions that they will take in life are already becoming visible, and they begin to grow apart. Thrown into a more laborious role on the farm, \u00c1ntonia quickly loses her feminine softness, and Jim\u2019s entry into school sets him off on an altogether separate road. Interestingly, in spite of, or perhaps because of, his more formal education, Jim fails to recognize the reality of this difference. When he says to \u00c1ntonia that he wishes she could always be \u201cnice\u201d rather than rough and tumble, she explains that \u201cthings will be easy for you. But they will be hard for us.\u201d Here, for the first time, Cather clearly presents the dichotomy between \u00c1ntonia\u2019s role as a rural worker and Jim\u2019s role as a leisured thinker\u2014a dichotomy that she explores throughout the remainder of the novel.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126021927/https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/antonia/section3/"}
