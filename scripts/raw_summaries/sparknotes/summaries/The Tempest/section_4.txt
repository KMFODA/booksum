{"name": "Act II, scene ii", "summary": "Summary Caliban enters with a load of wood, and thunder sounds in the background. Caliban curses and describes the torments that Prospero\u2019s spirits subject him to: they pinch, bite, and prick him, especially when he curses. As he is thinking of these spirits, Caliban sees Trinculo and imagines him to be one of the spirits. Hoping to avoid pinching, he lies down and covers himself with his cloak. Trinculo hears the thunder and looks about for some cover from the storm. The only thing he sees is the cloak-covered Caliban on the ground. He is not so much repulsed by Caliban as curious. He cannot decide whether Caliban is a \u201cman or a fish\u201d (II.ii.24). He thinks of a time when he traveled to England and witnessed freak-shows there. Caliban, he thinks, would bring him a lot of money in England. Thunder sounds again and Trinculo decides that the best shelter in sight is beneath Caliban\u2019s cloak, and so he joins the man-monster there. Stephano enters singing and drinking. He hears Caliban cry out to Trinculo, \u201cDo not torment me! O!\u201d (II.ii.54). Hearing this and seeing the four legs sticking out from the cloak, Stephano thinks the two men are a four-legged monster with a fever. He decides to relieve this fever with a drink. Caliban continues to resist Trinculo, whom he still thinks is a spirit tormenting him. Trinculo recognizes Stephano\u2019s voice and says so. Stephano, of course, assumes for a moment that the monster has two heads, and he promises to pour liquor in both mouths. Trinculo now calls out to Stephano, and Stephano pulls his friend out from under the cloak. While the two men discuss how they arrived safely on shore, Caliban enjoys the liquor and begs to worship Stephano. The men take full advantage of Caliban\u2019s drunkenness, mocking him as a \u201cmost ridiculous monster\u201d (II.ii.157) as he promises to lead them around and show them the isle. Read a translation of \t\t\t\t Act II, scene ii\u00a0\u2192 Analysis Trinculo and Stephano are the last new characters to be introduced in the play. They act as comic foils to the main action, and will in later acts become specific parodies of Antonio and Sebastian. At this point, their role is to present comically some of the more serious issues in the play concerning Prospero and Caliban. In Act I, scene ii, Prospero calls Caliban a \u201cslave\u201d (II.ii.311, 322, 347), \u201cthou earth\u201d (II.ii.317), \u201cFilth\u201d (II.ii.349), and \u201cHag-seed\u201d (II.ii.368). Stephano and Trinculo\u2019s epithet of choice in Act II, scene ii and thereafter is \u201cmonster.\u201d But while these two make quite clear that Caliban is seen as less than human by the Europeans on the island, they also treat him more humanely than Prospero does. Stephano and Trinculo, a butler and a jester respectively, remain at the low end of the social scale in the play, and have little difficulty finding friendship with the strange islander they meet. \u201cMisery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows,\u201d says Trinculo (II.ii.36\u201337), and then hastens to crawl beneath Caliban\u2019s garment in order to get out of the rain. The similarity, socially and perhaps physically as well, between Trinculo and Caliban is further emphasized when Stephano, drunk, initially mistakes the two for a single monster: \u201cThis is some monster of the isle with four legs\u201d (II.ii.62). More important than the emphasis on the way in which Caliban seems to others more monster than man, is the way in which this scene dramatizes the initial encounter between an almost completely isolated, \u201cprimitive\u201d culture and a foreign, \u201ccivilized\u201d one. The reader discovers during Caliban and Prospero\u2019s confrontation in Act I, scene ii that Prospero initially \u201cmade much of\u201d Caliban (II.ii.336); that he gave Caliban \u201cWater with berries in\u2019t\u201d (II.ii.337); that Caliban showed him around the island; and that Prospero later imprisoned Caliban, after he had taken all he could take from him. The reader can see these events in Act II, scene ii, with Trinculo and Stephano in the place of Prospero. Stephano calls Caliban a \u201cbrave monster,\u201d as they set off singing around the island. In addition, Stephano and Trinculo give Caliban wine, which Caliban finds to be a \u201ccelestial liquor\u201d (II.ii.109). Moreover, Caliban initially mistakes Stephano and Trinculo for Prospero\u2019s spirits, but alcohol convinces him that Stephano is a \u201cbrave god\u201d and decides unconditionally to \u201ckneel to him\u201d (II.ii.109\u2013110). This scene shows the foreign, civilized culture as decadent and manipulative: Stephano immediately plans to \u201cinherit\u201d the island (II.ii.167), using Caliban to show him all its virtues. Stephano and Trinculo are a grotesque, parodic version of Prospero upon his arrival twelve years ago. Godlike in the eyes of the native, they slash and burn their way to power. By this point, Caliban has begun to resemble a parody of himself. Whereas he would \u201cgabble like / A thing most brutish\u201d (I.ii.359\u2013360) upon Prospero\u2019s arrival, because he did not know language, he now is willfully inarticulate in his drunkenness. Immediately putting aside his fear that these men are spirits sent to do him harm, Caliban puts his trust in them for all the wrong reasons. What makes Caliban\u2019s behavior in this scene so tragic is that we might expect him, especially after his eloquent curses of Prospero in Act I, scene ii, to know better.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210131162607/https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/tempest/section5/"}
