{"name": "Chapter 7", "summary": "Chapter seven is very brief so it follows that the summary of it will also be quite short. Utterson and Enfield are walking as usual when they come before Mr. Hyde's door again. Both men muse that most likely they will never see Hyde again. Enfield also reveals that Mr. Hyde's house has a back exit which leads right into Dr. Jekyll's estate.\n\tSoon the two men venture into the home and look out of a window, where they see Dr. Jekyll looking out one of his windows as well. The two parties begin a casual conversation when suddenly Jekyll gets a horrified expression on his face and is suddenly thrown back from the window, which is \"instantly thrust down.\"\n\tBoth Utterson and Enfield are overcome with panic and astonished horror.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210215030727/https://www.novelguide.com/dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde/summaries/chap7"}
