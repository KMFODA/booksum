{"name": "Chapters 19-20", "summary": "Chapter 19: Now in London with Clerval, Victor tries to relax, but finds it impossible. For several months, Frankenstein puts off the task in hand and travels around England with Clerval instead. Eventually, however, he tells his best friend to leave him alone for a few weeks. Then, in solitude, Victor begins the process of creation again. He explains, \"I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question, but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil, that made my heart sicken in my bosom.\"\n\tChapter 20: Well into the process of building another monster, Victor suddenly realizes that he cannot be guaranteed that this new being that he is creating will agree to live in exile in South America. More troubling is the idea that the two monsters will produce a race of their own, which will roam the earth, terrorizing future generations of men. Looking out his window, he sees the devilish face of his creature, which makes him resolved to end his work. Soon, Frankenstein and his monster have another heated conversation and the creature repeats his threat of vengeance.\n\tWith this decided, Victor agrees to meet Clerval near a small town by the sea. When Frankenstein gets there, however, the inhabitants give him a very rude welcome, telling him that he is wanted by the police. This puzzles Victor, but he agrees to go with them.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200927043357/https://www.novelguide.com/frankenstein/summaries/chap19-20"}
