Noah Claypole, renamed by Fagin as Morris Bolter, was sent on his first assignment to find out what was going on with the boy there.  The evidence was strong against him, and though he tried to fight it, the Dodger would be locked up for life for his crimes.<PARAGRAPH>Chapter 44: Fagin was visiting Sikes when the clock struck eleven on Sunday evening.  Nancy put on her bonnet and prepared to go out, but Sikes stopped her.  They began fighting, and finally Sikes won and she did not go out.  Fagin thought it peculiar that she would throw such a fit about taking a walk so he assumed that she had another lover, or was sick of Sikes brutality.  Fagin decides that he needs Nancy to become more closely allied with himself, and wants to ask her to poison Sikes. \n\tChapter 45: Fagin informs Noah that he wants him to spy on Nancy for him.  He wants to know everywhere she goes, and whom she is with.  Noah agrees and waits for the time when Fagin wants him to go.
