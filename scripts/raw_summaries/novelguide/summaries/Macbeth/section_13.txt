Siward's young son approaches Macbeth and tries to duel with him.  Macbeth promptly kills him.  Macduff then enters the castle, followed by Siward.  Macduff wants to find and kill Macbeth so that his wife and children's ghosts will not haunt him.  The two roam the hallways, looking for the escapee Macbeth.<PARAGRAPH>Act 5, Scene 8: Macduff finally meets up with Macbeth and the two duel.  Macbeth tells Macduff that he does not fear anyone who was born of a woman.  Macduff, however, tells Macbeth that he was \"from his mother's womb untimely ripped.\" (Act 5, Scene 8, Lines 15-16) This means that Macduff was removed from his mother's womb via a cesarean section, and was not technically \"born of a woman.\" (Act 4, Scene 1, Line 80) Macduff kills Macbeth and returns to Malcolm with his head lanced onto a pole.  Siward learns that his young son is dead.  All of the men hail Malcolm as the rightful heir to the throne.\n\tMalcolm proclaims that he will reward all of his followers by making them earls.  In addition, he orders that everyone who fled Scotland in fear of Macbeth return to enjoy better times under his reign.
