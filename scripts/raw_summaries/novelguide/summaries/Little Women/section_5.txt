Beth came in one afternoon when Meg was sewing and Jo writing a story and asked if one of them would go check on the Hummels.  The Hummels were a poor family that Marmee usually went to help everyday.  Beth said she had gone everyday and was tired, but both Jo and Meg put off the task to pursue their own interests.  Beth later decided to go again, and when she came home, she told Jo that the Hummels baby had scarlet fever and had died in her arms.  Jo and Meg had both had the illness before so were in no danger, but Beth had not and became sick.  Amy also had not so they ordered her to go to Aunt March's until Beth was better.  She refused, but when Laurie was apprised of the situation, he convinced her to go.
