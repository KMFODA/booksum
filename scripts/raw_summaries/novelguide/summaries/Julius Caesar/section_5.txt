{"name": "Act 2, Scene 4", "summary": "Portia is restless and anxious about the welfare of her husband Brutus. She instructs their servant Lucius to go to the Senate building and take note of whether Brutus looks well, and what Caesar does. \n\tThe soothsayer enters. He tells Portia that he is planning to go to the streets to wait for Caesar to pass. He fears that ill may befall Caesar, and hopes to speak to him about the matter. Portia sends Lucius off to the capital, with instructions to return and inform her of what is happening.  \n\tAnalysis\n\tThis scene, like the last, serves to build up tension. Portia clearly has a bad feeling about what may be about to happen.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201029024802/https://www.novelguide.com/julius-caesar/summaries/act2-scen4"}
