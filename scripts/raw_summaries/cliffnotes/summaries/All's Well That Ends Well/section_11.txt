{"name": "Scene 1", "summary": "One of the French lords and a band of soldiers set a trap for Parolles as previously planned. They capture and blindfold him and speak in a hilarious nonsense language which he takes to be Russian \u2014 that is, \"Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.\" To save his life, Parolles, as predicted, immediately volunteers to betray anyone and anything:\nOh, let me live! And all the secrets of our camp I'll show, Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that Which you will wonder at. (92-95)", "analysis": "For Parolles, the Falstaffian mock-motto, \"Discretion is the better part of valor,\" seems to apply. There is no real surprise in his behavior, although his captors marvel at his self-knowledge:\nParolles: What shall I say I have done? It must be a veryPlausive [plausible] invention that carries it.They begin to smoke me [find me out], anddisgracesHave of late knocked too often at my door.I find My tongue is too foolhardy.First Lord [aside]: This is the first truth that e'er thine ownTongue was guilty of.Second Lord: Is it possible he should know what he is, andBe that he is? (28-36)\nThere is a sly joke embedded in this scene, in which the \"man of words\" (which is what Parolles' name literally means) is tricked by a plot which makes use of some assorted syllables of a gobbledygook language that Parolles thinks is Russian.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101100305/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/a/alls-well-that-ends-well/summary-and-analysis/act-iv-scene-1"}
