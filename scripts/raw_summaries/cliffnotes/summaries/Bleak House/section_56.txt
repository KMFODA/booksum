To keep her and himself closely in touch with Ada and Richard, Mr. Jarndyce decides to remain in London for an extended period of time and invite Allan's mother as a guest. Allan has decided to forego his projected long voyage.

Richard is languid, unkempt, and distracted. Esther surmises that he has lost faith in Vholes. Ada's greatest fear is that Richard will not live long enough to see the child she is now carrying.", "analysis": "Dickens now prepares us for Richard's seemingly imminent demise.
