This impression is reinforced by Dickens' use of foreshadowing. At the very end of the preceding chapter, Tulkinghorn is pictured complacent and then asleep \u2014 yet, somehow, looking very old and, in fact, not far from death. The present chapter closes with a Tulkinghorn who, though again complacent, catches sight of an arrow-wielding Roman painted on the ceiling.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101003913/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/b/bleak-house/summary-and-analysis/chapter-42"}
