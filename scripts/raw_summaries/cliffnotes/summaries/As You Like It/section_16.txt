{"name": "Scene 2", "summary": "Several of Duke Senior's followers have been hunting, and one of them has killed a deer. Jaques suggests that they \"present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror,\" and they carry out their slaughtered trophy, singing \"What shall he have that kill'd the deer?\"", "analysis": "This scene is a sequel to the last scene. Jaques again assumes his pose as critic-at-large. It is characteristic of him to criticize a song before it is sung, and this song, one might note, is concerned with the horns of the deer. This is a sexual reference to a man's being a cuckold \u2014 that is, the husband of an unfaithful wife, a situation which the Elizabethan audiences never tired of as a source for comedy. Throughout all of literature, the cuckolded husband has been the butt of many comedies.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201123193643/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/a/as-you-like-it/summary-and-analysis/act-iv-scene-2"}
