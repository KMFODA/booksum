{"name": "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Summary & Analysis | Chapter 11 | Study Guide | CliffsNotes", "summary": "Still in disguise,\u00a0Huck\u00a0enters the woman's house and introduces himself as \"Sarah Williams from Hookerville.\" Accepting Huck as a girl, the woman talks freely about the town's events and eventually reaches the subject of Huck and\u00a0Tom, the reward money, and Huck's \"murder.\" Suspicion began with Pap Finn, she says, but after\u00a0Jim\u00a0escaped, the town decided that the runaway slave had murdered Huck. With both Pap and Jim still suspects, the town has announced a reward of $300 for Jim and $200 for Pap.\nThe woman tells Huck she thinks she knows where Jim could be hiding, for she is sure she has seen smoke over at Jackson's Island. Huck becomes nervous when he learns that the woman's husband and another man are heading for Jackson's Island to search for Jim. Before Huck can leave, the woman figures out that he is not a girl, and Huck makes up yet another wild tale for explanation.\nHuck rushes back to Jackson's Island and wakes Jim with the news that \"There ain't a minute to lose. They're after us!\" In complete silence, the two runaways pack their camp and head down the river on the raft.<PARAGRAPH>", "analysis": "Chapter 11 displays yet another facet of Huck Finn's humor; that is, the ability of Huck to disguise himself and convince gullible adults to believe his preposterous stories. Huck is, indeed, an imaginative trickster who lies and fibs his way along the Mississippi. (These traits are one reason that authors such as Louisa May Alcott condemned his character as being unsuitable for young readers.) Huck is also prone, however, to forget his early stories, and therefore he is forced to invent new tales in order to continue his deception. The constantly changing fabrication is certainly comical and displays the creative ability of Huck as well as the ignorance of the people he meets.\nThe fact that the woman fools Huck into revealing his identity as a boy also provides much of the humor in the chapter. Despite his maverick nature, Huck is a product of the environment and thus is subject to the same type of manipulation that he performs on others. The tricks that the woman uses force Huck to reveal his male nature, his \"boy\" characteristics (the inability to thread a needle, for example). Even though the woman discovers Huck is not a girl, Huck is still able to save his story by donning another disguise as an orphaned and mistreated apprentice. The added story is yet another example of Huck's ability to succeed and adapt in a world of scams and con artists.\nThe readers should note that Chapter 11 ends with Huck and Jim functioning as a team. When Huck discovers that Jim is in danger, he does not think about society's judgment and simply reacts. In Huck's view, the pursuing men are after both of them, even though the consequences for Huck would be minimal. In other words, Huck unconsciously places Jim's safety above his own, and their separate struggles for freedom become one. As Huck and Jim slip \"past the foot of the island dead still, never saying a word,\" Twain takes another step away from the childish adventures of Tom Sawyer and cements the relationship between the two outcasts.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101055818/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/a/the-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn/summary-and-analysis/chapter-11"}
