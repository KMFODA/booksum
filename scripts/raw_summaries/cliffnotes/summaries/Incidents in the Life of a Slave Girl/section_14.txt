{"name": "Chapter 30", "summary": "With the help of Peter and Phillip, Linda and Fanny are smuggled aboard a ship headed for Philadelphia. Although the ship's captain treats the women with kindness and respect, Linda is afraid to trust him, fearful that at any moment he might betray them and turn them in for a reward. Even though they are free, both women feel alone and abandoned, and mourn the loss of friends and family. Standing on the ship's deck, Linda and Fanny are both deeply moved when, for the first time in their lives, they see the sun rise over free soil.", "analysis": "Although exhilarated by their hard-won freedom, Fanny and Linda are overwhelmed by feelings of loneliness, loss, and abandonment. However, Linda takes a first step toward trust. Initially, she fears that the captain and crew will betray them: \"slavery had made me suspicious of every body.\" As the ship approaches Philadelphia, the captain realizes her concern and regrets that she doesn't trust him after such a long journey together. He assures Linda that he will see that they are protected until they depart. Linda admits to herself that this white man has acted honorably toward them and was worthy of their trust.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210814105251/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/i/incidents-in-the-life-of-a-slave-girl/summary-and-analysis/chapter-30"}
