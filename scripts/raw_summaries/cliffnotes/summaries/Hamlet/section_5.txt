{"name": "Hamlet: Act II Scene 1 Summary & Analysis | Shakespeare | CliffsNotes", "summary": "Polonius meets with his sly servant Reynaldo and tells him to go to Paris and spy on Laertes. He charges the servant to find any Danes living in Paris and to question them as to Laertes' whereabouts and reputation. Polonius even goes so far as to give Reynaldo permission to use lies to entrap Laertes. After Reynaldo exits in pursuit of his mission, Ophelia enters and tells Polonius that she has been horrified by the Prince. Hamlet came to her in her sewing room with his jacket askew and unfastened, and wearing no hat; his stockings were filthy and unfastened, drooping at his ankles; and he was pale and trembling, looking \"piteous.\" Polonius diagnoses Hamlet's condition as madness due to his love of Ophelia, brought about because Ophelia obeyed her father and spurned Hamlet's advances. Polonius decides to take his information to the king.", "analysis": "Many critics, including T.S. Eliot, believe this scene is irrelevant to the play. However, the scene actually mirrors themes that are central to the play's purpose. Appearance and reality are disparate entities that contradict one another.\nIn Act II, Scene 1, the apparently caring, nurturing father Polonius hires the shady Reynaldo (The Fox) to spy on Laertes. Polonius tells Reynaldo that he suspects the worst of Laertes and wants reports of all his dirtiest deeds gleaned from the most deceptive spying. He tells Reynaldo to look into Laertes' life in Paris even if he needs to accuse his son falsely \u2014 'What forgeries you please.'\" Polonius will pay Reynaldo to discredit Laertes with negative reports \u2014 both real and imagined \u2014 in order to teach his son the importance of reputation. The duplicity of this encounter foreshadows the behavior that will characterize Polonius throughout the play.\nIn the second part of the scene, Ophelia enters and reports that Hamlet has been acting incomprehensibly. She describes with painter's language the way Hamlet is attired:\nLord Hamlet with his doublet unbraced\nNo hat upon his head, his stockings fouled,\nUngartered, and down-gyved to his ankle\nPale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,\nAnd with a look so piteous in purport\nAs if he had been loos\u00e8d out of hell\nTo speak of horrors \u2014 he comes before me.\nThe description is one that Polonius immediately recognizes \u2014 \"Mad for thy love?\" \u2014 because Hamlet's appearance embodies the contemporary stereotype of the spurned lover, indicating that his main objective in visiting Ophelia is to use Ophelia to convince others that his insanity was not due to any mysterious unknown cause, but to this disappointment, and so to allay the suspicions of the King. Thus, Ophelia's purpose in this scene seems to be to give credence to the notion that Hamlet never loved Ophelia at all, but merely used her. If so, then Hamlet is as guilty of deceptiveness as are those he judges.\nGlossary\nDanskers Danes.\nwhat means what their income is.\nkeep lodge.\ndrabbing associating with prostitutes.\nseason qualify.\nincontinency without self-restraint, especially in regard to sexual activity.\nquaintly skillfully, ingeniously.\nunreclaimed untamed.\nof general assault common to all men.\nvidelicet (Latin) that is; namely.\nwindlasses roundabout means.\nassays of bias This is a metaphor from the game of lawn bowling; the weight in the ball, which causes it to follow a curved line, is called the bias.
