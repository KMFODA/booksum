{"name": "Scene 4", "summary": "In the palace of the French king, the king expresses his fear of the approaching English forces. He tells the Dauphin to prepare for war \"with men of courage and with means defendant.\" But the Dauphin maintains that the English will be easy to defeat and that Henry is a \"vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth.\"\nThe Constable of France believes the Dauphin is mistaken and has misjudged the character of the English king. The French king agrees and urges the Dauphin to remember that \"King Harry\" comes from the line of Edward, the Black Prince of Wales, a fierce warrior who won the Battle of Cressy. \"This is a stem / Of that victorious stock; and let us fear / The native mightiness and fate of him.\"\nExeter enters, as the ambassador from King Henry, asking the French king to give up his crown and give it to King Henry, the rightful heir; if he refuses, bloodshed and war will follow. He warns the Dauphin that his gift of tennis balls was not appreciated and that he shall have to answer to King Henry for the insult.\nThe French king tells Exeter that he shall have to wait until the next day for his answer.", "analysis": "The basic purpose of this scene is twofold: first, to show that the French court is not prepared for war, and second, to show the disunity which is prevalent in the court. The French king, Charles VI, is not characterized as an impressive king. Even though he is correct in his appraisal of King Henry, he does not possess a commanding presence.\nThe Dauphin, as was indicated by his insulting gift of the tennis balls in the first act, is characterized as a rather insolent, self-opinionated young man who will function as a direct contrast to the more noble Henry. The Dauphin believes that the French should have good defenses but not because of the approach of young King Henry; he is guided not by fear but only by the general principle that one should always have good defenses.\nOf more direct concern in this scene are the words of Exeter, the English ambassador; he echoes the king's determination, and he anticipates the spirit of the scenes to come in his reference to the horrors of war which can be avoided only by the French king's submission to the will of King Henry V. Exeter warns:\n. . . if you hide the crownEven in your hearts, there will he rake for it.Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,That, if requiring fail, he will compel.
