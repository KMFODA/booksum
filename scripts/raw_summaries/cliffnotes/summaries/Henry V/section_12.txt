{"name": "Scene 4", "summary": "In a room of the French palace at Rouen, Katharine, the king's daughter, and Alice, the old gentlewoman, have an English lesson. Alice knows only a little English, and Princess Katharine is trying to learn the language. All of the dialogue is in French except the few words (hand, nails, arm, and elbow, etc.) that she learns from Alice during the lesson.", "analysis": "Katharine, the future Queen of England whom Henry will woo and become betrothed to in the final scene of the play, is here introduced as a girl of fourteen whose destiny has already been decided. The purpose of the scene is to give the audience some light-hearted relief from the battle scenes and also to show that Katharine, by her statement that \"it is necessary\" that she learn English, is already reconciled to the idea that she is to be Henry's queen.\nIn this scene, the French words and phrases that appeared in the early editions of the play were filled with errors and have been corrected by successive editors. Even though the content is trivial and hardly needs a translation, a loose translation follows:\nKath.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alice, you have been to England, and you speak the language well.\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A little, my lady.\nKath.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I beg you to teach me because it will be necessary that I learn it. How does one say la main in English?\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0La main? It is called de hand.\nKath.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De hand. And les doigts?\nAlice.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Les doigts? O my goodness, I have forgotten les doigts; but I shall soon remember it. Les doigts? I think that they are called de fingres; yes, de fingres.\nKath.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. I think that I am a good student; I have quickly learned two English words. How does one say les ongles?\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Les ongles? They are called de nails.\nKath.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De nails. Listen and tell me if I speak well: de hand, de fingres, and de nails.\nAlice.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You have spoken well, my lady; it is very good English.\nKath.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tell me the English for le bras.\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De arm, my lady.\nKath. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And le coude.\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De elbow.\nKath.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De elbow. I will now repeat all of the words that you have taught me up to now.\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think that it will be very difficult, my lady.\nKath.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Excuse me, Alice; listen: de hand, de fingres, de nails, de arma, de bilbow.\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De elbow, my lady.\nKath.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O my goodness, I forgot. De elbow. How does one say le col?\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De nick, my lady.\nKath. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De nick. And le menton?\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De chin.\nKath, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De sin. Le col, de nick; le menton, de sin.\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes. To your honor, in truth, you pronounce the words as though you were a native English lady.\nKath.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do not doubt it at all that I shall be able to learn it in a little more time.\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Have you yet forgotten what I have already taught you?\nKath.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No, I shall recite to you promptly: de hand, de fingres, de mails, \u2014 \nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De nails, my lady.\nKath. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De nails, de arm, de ilbow.\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With your permission, de elbow.\nKath. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is what I said; de elbow, de nick, and de sin. Now how do you say le pied and la robe?\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De foot, my lady, and de coun.\nKath.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De foot and de coun! O my Lord! These are very bad words \u2014 evil, vulgar and immodest, and not for ladies of honor to use. I would never pronounce these words before French gentlemen \u2014 not for the whole world. Foo! Le foot and le coun! Nevertheless, I am going to recite my entire lesson together one more time: de hand, de fingres, de nails, de arm, de elbow, de nick, de sin, de foot, de coun.\nAlice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Excellent, my lady!\nKath. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is enough for this time; let's go to dinner.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219133100/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/henry-v/summary-and-analysis/act-iii-scene-4"}
