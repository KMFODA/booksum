How else could a wood march upon a castle? This now answers a question clearly being asked by the audience. It is not going to be by valor on the battlefield that Malcolm will win, it will be through the unhinging of Macbeth's mind. The first significant part of this destruction is the use of branches from Birnam Wood as camouflage.<PARAGRAPH>Macbeth is described by Malcolm as a rotten fruit, ripe for the shaking, an indication to the audience that goodness will prevail over evil."}
