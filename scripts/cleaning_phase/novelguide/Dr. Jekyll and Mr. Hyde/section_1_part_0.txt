{"name": "Chapter 2", "summary": "Chapter two begins with Mr. Utterson returning to his home and soon going into his study where he pulls out the will of Dr. Jekyll, for whom he is the lawyer. The will states that after the death or prolonged absence of the doctor, all his assets will be given to Mr. Hyde. Now that Utterson knows that Hyde is the child trampler, he feels very uncomfortable with the will.\n\tNext, Utterson decides to visit Dr. Lanyon, an old friend from school and also an old friend of Dr. Jekyll. Soon Utterson asks Lanyon about Jekyll, saying, \"Did you ever come across a protege of his-- one Hyde?\" Lanyon admits that he's never heard of the man, and the lawyer regretfully returns to his home.\n\tUtterson has a fitful night sleep in which he can't escape thinking about Hyde. Finally he tells himself, \"If he be Mr. Hyde, I shall be Mr. Seek.\"\n\tA few days later, Utterson comes upon Hyde on the street and soon confronts the villain. After a brief and peculiar conversation, Hyde retreats into the strange house for which he has the key. Utterson, having seen Hyde's devilish face, stands alone by the door, \"the picture of disquietude.\" Utterson now realizes why Enfield spoke of Hyde as the perfect symbol of evil and loathing.\n\tEventually Utterson tries to visit Dr. Jekyll, but the doctor is not home, so Utterson leaves, thinking that if Hyde knows that he is in Jekyll's will, \"he may grow impatient to inherit.\" This begins Utterson's suspicion that Hyde is out to murder Dr. Jekyll.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210215030727/https://www.novelguide.com/dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde/summaries/chap2"}
