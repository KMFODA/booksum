When the wheel turns, and a man is on the bottom, he is miserable: \"Such is the game she plays\" . She has a heart of steel and laughs even at kings. She does not respond to the misery of men.

His own life was a perfect example of the cruel game of Fortune. He was a patrician in Rome, of ancient and royal family, who also happened to be a virtuous and scholarly man, hoping to benefit humanity with his wisdom and learning. He had a good wife, two sons who were Roman consuls; he had wealth and fame and a comfortable home. He was still young enough  to have his health. He had produced voluminous translations of precious Greek texts, preserving them for future generations. Without warning or just cause, he was thrown into prison and executed on the pretext he had committed some treason. How can Boethius think of Fortune as a friend or pine after her gifts? It is a game that cannot be won by humans.\n\n\t \n\nSummary of Part II\n\n\t \n\n\tPhilosophy now plays the part of Fortune, speaking in Fortune's voice to show humans how they misunderstand her. \n\n\t \n\n\tFortune argues that she has not stolen any gifts from Boethius because none of them belonged to him in the first place, nor to any humans. He came naked from the womb, and Fortune fed him from her own resources. She was indulgent, and when she withdrew her hand, he cried out as though she had stolen something from him. Everything else in creation is allowed to be itself. All Fortune's gifts come and go with her. Are humans so greedy that they demand Fortune to be constant, when inconstancy is her nature? \n\n\t \n\n\tFortune gives examples of humans who fell from her wheel. Croesus, king of Lydia, went from wealth to misery. Perses, the last king of Macedonia, was also a tragic figure. Tragedy is a literary form that acknowledges these reversals of Fortune. \n\n\t \n\nCommentary on Part II\n\n\t \n\n\tPhilosophy in Fortune's voice reminds Boethius of the story in Homer about the two jars in God's house, one full of evil and one full of good. Boethius has had more than his share of the good, and now it is time to taste the bad. Fortune's very changefulness should give him hope, because nothing stays the same. She sings a song about the greed of humans, always wanting more, never satisfied, no matter how much they get. They will always complain.\n\n\t \n\nSummary of Part III\n\n\t \n\n\tNow Philosophy invites Boethius to reply.\n\n\t \n\n\tHe says her words are sweet but do not help the mind weighed down by \"deep seated melancholy\" .\n\n\t \n\n\tPhilosophy counters that Boethius has forgotten his many blessings as \"the luckiest man in the world\" , adopted by Symmachus, married to a modest wife, having two sons and worldly honors. The culmination of his fortune, however, was the day his two sons became consuls together, and the senators appreciated the glorious oratory of Boethius on this honor. This is the only time Fortune has been unfriendly to him. The things he moans about are passing away, that is all. He knows there is no permanence. \n\n\t \n\nCommentary on Part III\n\n\t \n\n\tPhilosophy speaking for the goddess Fortune tries to explain to Boethius that it makes no difference whether Fortune deserts him at some point, or that he deserts her by dying. These honors and gifts are never permanent. She sings a song about the instability of the world: \"In law eternal it lies decreed/ That naught from change is ever freed\" . He has been one of the lucky ones in life, but he cannot expect to be exempt from change, when it is the whole way Nature functions in different cycles; in spring, winter, storm, and calm.<PARAGRAPH>Book II<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>Summary of Part I<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>Philosophy speaks to Boethius explaining he is pining away for his former good fortune, and his imagination has distorted his mind with longing for what he lost.
