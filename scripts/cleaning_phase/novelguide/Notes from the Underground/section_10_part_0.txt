For the UM realizes that his love has been tainted by his books, by his head.  Liza, on the other hand, shows him true love, love from the heart-selfless love.\n\tThus, the UM concludes that he has ruined his life \"through moral decay in  corner.\" Not living up to his own self-framed image of himself as a hero, he is, indeed, the epitome of an anti-hero.  Lastly, he returns to his idea that suffering and anguish can be man's most advantageous advantage.  He finds a certain satisfaction and truthfulness in his own suffering, and hopes that Liza will find a similar satisfaction, despite the obvious hardship and grief that the said suffering will entail.\n\tHere, the Notesjust cut off, with the editors explaining that \"we might as well stop here.\"", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200923070519/https://www.novelguide.com/notes-from-the-underground/summaries/part2-chap10"}
