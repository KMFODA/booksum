{"name": "Macbeth: Summary & Analysis Act I Scene 6 | CliffsNotes", "summary": "King Duncan and his retinue arrive at Inverness. Various formal greetings are exchanged between the king and Lady Macbeth, who, like a chameleon, now takes on the more typical role of perfect hostess.", "analysis": "Duncan's speech on his arrival at Inverness is heavy with dramatic irony: Not only is the \"seat\"  of the castle \"pleasant,\" but even the air is sweeter than that to which the king is accustomed. The presence of the martlet  serves to heighten the irony. As far as the king is concerned, the castle, from the outside at least, appears to be a paradise. Contrast this picture of delight with the imagery of hell that forms the substance of the Porter scene .\nThe king's address to Lady Macbeth and her subsequent reply are full of the heightened language of formal introduction: \"God 'ild you,\" \"We rest your hermits  ever.\" Of course, her elaborate greeting contrasts her language of the previous scene and emphasizes her falsity.\nThe stage directions that frame this scene are full of the pomp and ceremony of a royal visit. To a musical accompaniment, food and drink are transported from one side of the stage to the other. Although the audience does not see the revelry on stage, Shakespeare intends us to understand that the king is to be well entertained.\nGlossary\ntemple-haunting martlet  bird that nests in church porches\nloved mansionry  favorite building\njutty . . . vantage  eaves, convenient corner\npendent  hanging\nprocreant cradle  nest\nhaunt  regularly visit\nlove . . . love  As king, I must always acknowledge my subjects' love even though doing so is a burden to me.
