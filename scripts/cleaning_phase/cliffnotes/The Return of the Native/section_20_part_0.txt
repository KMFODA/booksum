On the Fifth of November evening, he goes to see Thomasin and Wildeve, though he doesn't know Wildeve is then on his way to see Eustacia at her grandfather's house. Since Thomasin doesn't know, he tells her of the state of affairs between himself and Eustacia. Thomasin advises him to contact Eustacia. When he gets home, he writes her a letter, inviting her to return.\nWhen Wildeve returns home from Mistover Knap, Thomasin questions him closely enough about this walk and others to annoy him.", "analysis": "As chapter 1 in this book is a summary one, this chapter is used for purposes of transition. Nothing really happens, everything is reaching dead center. Hardy shows, for instance, that Clym is delaying any contact with Eustacia as he did with his mother before the fateful journey across the heath. Obviously, some decisive action is imminent. Clym, Eustacia, Thomasin, Wildeve -- all are faced in their personal destinies with questions and no answers.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201102050840/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/r/the-return-of-the-native/summary-and-analysis/book-5-chapter-6"}
