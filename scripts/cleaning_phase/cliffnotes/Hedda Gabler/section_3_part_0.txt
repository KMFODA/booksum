{"name": "Act IV", "summary": "It is later in the evening. Miss Tesman enters, dressed in mourning. Hedda greets her, expressing regret for Rina's death. Aunt Julia plans to fill the gap in her life by finding someone to care for. Because it is necessary to live for someone, she says, she will seek an occupant for Rina's little room -- some invalid in want of nursing.\nAfter Julia leaves, George comes back, asking Hedda for the manuscript; he fears Lovborg might do himself injury before he can return it. Coolly, Hedda tells him she burned the papers. She wanted no one to put her husband \"in the shade,\" she tells the delighted George, who never heard Hedda express her love for him.\nThea suddenly appears, apologizing for the intrusion. Having heard that Lovborg is in the hospital, she asks if they have further news of his condition. Brack, newly arrived, tells them that Lovborg wounded himself in the breast. \"Not in the temple?\" Hedda quickly inquires.\nWhile Thea makes an effort to control herself, Hedda breaks the silence, declaring that there is beauty in this suicide, for Eilert has made up his account with life. \"He has had the courage to do the one right thing,\" she affirms.\nGeorge expresses regret that Lovborg has left the world without bequeathing it \"the book that would have immortalized his name.\" Mrs. Elvsted fumbles in her dress pocket. Producing many scraps of paper -- \"all the loose notes he used to dictate from\" -- she suggests that they might reconstruct the book. George is delighted. Having spent his career organizing other people's manuscripts, he is eager to dedicate himself to putting together Lovborg's notes. Forgetful of everything but the papers spread on the table before them, Thea and George begin the task.\nHedda languidly reclines in the armchair, Judge Brack at her side. It gives her a new feeling of freedom, she tells her admirer, to know that a \"deed of deliberate courage is still possible in this world -- a deed of spontaneous beauty.\" Brack dispels her illusions, informing her of the true circumstances of Lovborg's death, which he did not disclose to Thea. Lovborg did not die voluntarily, he tells the astonished Hedda. The police discovered the body in Mlle. Diana's boudoir: Lovborg had forced his way into the singer's apartment, talking wildly about a \"lost child.\" While they struggled, the pistol in his breast pocket discharged itself, and he died from a bullet wound in his bowels.\nHer shocked face is disfigured by an expression of loathing and despair. \"Oh, what a curse is it that makes everything I touch turn ludicrous and mean?\" she cries out. Brack remains unperturbed. One more disagreeable aspect remains, he says, for Lovborg must have stolen the pistol. Hedda passionately denies this, and Brack nods. He says that if someone were to identify the pistol, she herself would be drawn into the scandal. \"So I am in your power, Judge Brack,\" says Hedda. \"You have me at your beck and call from this time forward.\" Leaning closer, he assures her that he shall not \"abuse his advantage.\"\nHedda stands behind Mrs. Elvsted, passing her hands affectionately through her friend's hair. \"Here you are, Thea, sitting with George -- just as you used to sit with Eilert Lovborg,\" and she asks whether she can inspire George as well as she used to inspire Eilert. Intently working, her husband exclaims that he begins to feel inspired by Thea and asks his wife to return to Judge Brack. \"Is there nothing I can do to help you two?\" asks Hedda. \"No, nothing in the world,\" George answers without looking up.\nHe suggests to Thea that she rent the room in Aunt Julia's apartment; without disturbing Hedda, they can meet there every evening to work on the manuscript. \"But how am I to get through the evenings out here?\" Hedda calls from the back room. George assures her that the judge shall look in on her every now and then. Brack gaily adds that he shall visit \"every blessed evening,\" and that \"we shall get on capitally together, we two!\" Loud and clear, Hedda answers, \"Yes, don't you flatter yourself we will, Judge Brack. Now that you are the one cock in the basket -- \" A shot rings out. George, Mrs. Elvsted, and Brack discover Hedda stretched lifeless on the sofa; she has shot herself in the temple.", "analysis": "Going beyond the destruction that Hedda began in the previous acts, circumstances depicted in the final scene destroy the life's work of each other character. Julia's sister dies, leaving the old aunt with no one to care for; George relinquishes his work on medieval Brabant; Thea has definitely lost Lovborg; and Hedda confronts profound disillusion when she learns of Eilert's ignoble death.\nThe secondary characters, however, all find vocational rebirth as they confront their ruined life purposes. Thea, having saved Lovborg's notes, begins, with George Tesman, to conceive a new \"child\"; the professor so expert at assembling other people's manuscripts can dedicate his abilities to reconstruct his dead friend's brilliant ideas; and Julia can again care for her beloved nephew now that Hedda is gone.\nHedda alone faces a life without a future. Deprived of her satisfaction at the beauty of Eilert's suicide, she learns that she was in fact responsible for the abhorrent manner of Lovborg's death. Her ideal of freedom, courage, and beauty turns into a loathsome reality. Judge Brack applies the final vulgar touch to a situation that Hedda already finds repulsive; he alone can inform the police of the facts that would implicate her in a shocking scandal. The conventional Hedda must either succumb to Brack's power or face a public inquiry. Now that even her husband has no further need of her, no one depends upon Hedda at this point. On the other hand, she is unwillingly enthralled by the ruthless Brack. Deprived of freedom, Hedda faces either \"boring herself to death\" or committing a valiant suicide.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201130174449/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/h/hedda-gabler/summary-and-analysis/act-iv"}
