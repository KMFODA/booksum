{"name": "Chapter 30", "summary": "Caddy Jellyby and Prince Turveydrop have a church wedding; Esther and Ada serve as bridesmaids. The newlyweds are to have a week's honeymoon at Gravesend . Allan Woodcourt's mother mentions to Esther that her son, Allan, has the \"fault\" of paying attention to girls in whom he has no real interest. The wedding guests include a Miss Wisk, a fanatic on the subject of women's emancipation.<PARAGRAPH>", "analysis": "The \"happy ending\" for Caddy and Prince foreshadows the happy marriage later on of Esther and Allan Woodcourt. The mention of Allan prevents readers from forgetting about a character who will become more and more important but who is not now a part of the action.\nA traditionalist on the subject of the family, and a critic of all fanaticism, Dickens takes the opportunity to satirize a proponent of women's liberation.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101003913/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/b/bleak-house/summary-and-analysis/chapter-30"}
