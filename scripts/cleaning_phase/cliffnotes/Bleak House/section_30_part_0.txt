{"name": "Chapter 33", "summary": "Guppy and Jobling  have gone to the Sol's Arms tavern adjoining Krook's shop. Alarmed or merely curious about what happened, numerous people of the area crowd into the tavern, many remaining awake all night. Snagsby comes in, is puzzled about the \"combustion,\" and is soon confronted by his wife, who wants to know why he is there. Then the whole family of Smallweeds appears, and Grandfather Smallweed, whose wife turns out to be Krook's sister, lays claim to Krook's property.<PARAGRAPH>The following night, Guppy visits Lady Dedlock and says that he will be unable to deliver the Hawdon letters he promised to bring her. As Guppy leaves, he sees Tulkinghorn; the old lawyer immediately becomes suspicious.", "analysis": "Dickens strengthens artistic unity by establishing, through Krook, a relationship between the main plot and the subplot involving the Smallweeds. At the end of the chapter, the motif of Tulkinghorn's obsession with Lady Dedlock resumes.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101003913/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/b/bleak-house/summary-and-analysis/chapter-33"}
