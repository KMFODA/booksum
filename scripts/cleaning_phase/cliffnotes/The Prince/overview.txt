{"name": "Overview", "summary": "The Prince is an extended analysis of how to acquire and maintain political power. It includes 26 chapters and an opening dedication to Lorenzo de Medici. The dedication declares Machiavelli's intention to discuss in plain language the conduct of great men and the principles of princely government. He does so in hope of pleasing and enlightening the Medici family.\nThe book's 26 chapters can be divided into four sections: Chapters 1-11 discuss the different types of principalities or states, Chapters 12-14 discuss the different types of armies and the proper conduct of a prince as military leader, Chapters 15-23 discuss the character and behavior of the prince, and Chapters 24-26 discuss Italy's desperate political situation. The final chapter is a plea for the Medici family to supply the prince who will lead Italy out of humiliation.\nThe types of principalities\nMachiavelli lists four types of principalities:\nHereditary principalities, which are inherited by the ruler\nMixed principalities, territories that are annexed to the ruler's existing territories\nNew principalities, which may be acquired by several methods: by one's own power, by the power of others, by criminal acts or extreme cruelty, or by the will of the people \nEcclesiastical principalities, namely the Papal States belonging to the Catholic church\nThe types of armies\nA prince must always pay close attention to military affairs if he wants to remain in power. Machiavelli lists four types of armies:\nMercenaries or hired soldiers, which are dangerous and unreliable\nAuxiliaries, troops that are loaned to you by other rulers--also dangerous and unreliable\nNative troops, composed of one's own citizens or subjects--by far the most desirable kind\nMixed troops, a combination of native troops and mercenaries or auxiliaries--still less desirable than a completely native army\nThe character and behavior of the prince\nMachiavelli recommends the following character and behavior for princes:\nIt is better to be stingy than generous.\nIt is better to be cruel than merciful.\nIt is better to break promises if keeping them would be against one's interests.\nPrinces must avoid making themselves hated and despised; the goodwill of the people is a better defense than any fortress.\nPrinces should undertake great projects to enhance their reputation.\nPrinces should choose wise advisors and avoid flatterers.\nItaly's political situation\nMachiavelli outlines and recommends the following:\nThe rulers of Italy have lost their states by ignoring the political and military principles Machiavelli enumerates.\nFortune controls half of human affairs, but free will controls the rest, leaving the prince free to act. However, few princes can adapt their actions to the times.\nThe final chapter is an exhortation to the Medici family to follow Machiavelli's principles and thereby free Italy from foreign domination.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201108110625/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/p/the-prince/book-summary"}
