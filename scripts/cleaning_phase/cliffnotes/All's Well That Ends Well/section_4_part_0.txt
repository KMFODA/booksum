{"name": "Scene 2", "summary": "The Countess and her clown/servant, Lavache, discourse on the subject of the \"court,\" where he is shortly to be sent on an errand.", "analysis": "This comical interlude has a threefold function:  as a bridge,  as an emotional and thematic gloss on the scenes either side of it, and  as a simple entertainment in itself. Remember, Shakespeare's comic actors were given room for improvisation, and hence a scene like this one, obliquely satirizing courtly manners, could be largely visual in the person of the clown preparing himself to make an appearance before a group of courtiers. While practicing the art of foppishly affected speech -- the inanely repeated \"universal answer\" to every question is \"O Lord, sir!\" -- the clown is no doubt also training himself physically, in highly artificial, dance-like movements. This, Shakespeare seems to be saying, is the world to which Bertram wants to attach himself.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201101100305/https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/a/alls-well-that-ends-well/summary-and-analysis/act-ii-scene-2"}
