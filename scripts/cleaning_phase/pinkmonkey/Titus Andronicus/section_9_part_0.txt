{"name": "Scene 3", "summary": "Scene 3 Summary Titus sets his kinsmen to locate gods and seek justice for him and his family. Then he hands each one of them with an arrow addressed to the Roman Gods. At Marcus prompting they direct the arrows into the court. Titus mistakes a clown as a messenger from the Gods as the clown is carrying a basket containing pigeons. Titus believes that the birds are carrying messages for him from God. Although the clown says that he does not know anything about messages from God Titus entrusts the clown with a message for the emperor. Notes Titus plans to seek out Pluto and to send arrows with messages for the various other Gods, underlines the fact that, his grief has unhinged his mind. This scene gains significance from Publius words,\" Revenge from hell\". Titus is on a path of vengeance and as Publius words show revenge comes from hell once again pointing out Titus alienation from the world of sane men. His words \"Justice, is so employd ... you must needs stay a time\", although lightly spoken contain a grim truth that invests this scene with deeper meaning than may at first be apparent.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820050202/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmTitus21.asp"}
