{"name": "Scene 2", "summary": "Act II, Scene 2 Summary There is a public announcement that the Turkish fleet has been destroyed, and the danger of attack is past. The occasion is to be celebrated. In addition, the festivities will be a celebration of Othellos marriage to Desdemona. According to his orders, all people are to eat, drink, and enjoy themselves at Othellos expense. Notes This brief scene invites the citizens to celebrate the recent victory over the Turks, largely due to Othellos noble efforts. It is also to be a celebration of the generals nuptials, again linking the public and the domestic action of the play. Since it is Othello who orders the celebration, it shows that he is clearly in command. The scene also \"neutralizes\" the action for a moment, before Iago really goes to work.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210416215230/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmOthello16.asp"}
