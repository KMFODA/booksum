{"name": "overview", "summary": "Helena, the orphaned daughter of the celebrated physician Gerard  de Narbon, is in love with the Countess's son, Bertram, but  despairs of ever winning his affection because of the vast  difference in their social rank. Bertram leaves his mother's home to  present himself to the King for service, and Helena, despairing,  thinks of a way to win his love. She will use her father's medicine  to cure the King of France, and in return, will ask for a husband of  her choosing. When the King is restored to health, Helena chooses  Bertram, who vehemently objects to what he thinks is a  humiliating alliance. Social rank is extremely important to  Bertram, and he is too proud to have Helena for a wife, despite the  fact that she is loved by all. Bertram finally agrees to marry Helena  because he is afraid of displeasing the King. But with the  encouragement of Parolles, Bertram decides to leave for Paris  immediately after the wedding, abandoning his new bride before  consummating their union. In his letter declaring that he is leaving her, Bertram agrees to consummate          his marriage with Helena if she can do two things: first, she must obtain          the family ring that he always wears around his finger, and second, she          must have his child. Clearly, neither is feasible since he has run away          and refuses to sleep with her. The King and Bertram's mother are incensed          at his abandonment and vow to disown him. Helena is hurt by the fact that          she has caused Bertram's flight to Paris. She disguises herself as a pilgrim and sets out for the shrine of Saint          Jaques le Grand, hoping to trick Bertram into returning home. Helena learns          on her arrival in Florence, that Bertram has attempted to seduce a young          woman named Diana, who lives with her widowed mother. Helena convinces          the widow that she is Bertram's wife and promises a generous reward to          the two ladies if they will help her carry out a plan to win Bertram. She asks Diana to pretend to yield to Bertram's entreaties, then demand          from him the ring on his finger. Then Diana is to fix a time for Bertram          to come to her bed, and there, in the dark, Helena will take her place. Bertram, after sleeping with \"Diana\" and promising to marry          her when his wife is dead, learns that Helena is dead . Bertram abandons the \"virgin\" he thinks          he has taken, and returns to France. In France, everyone is prepared to          forgive Bertram, and Lafeu, an aging Lord and good family friend, even          offers his child as a second wife for Bertram, to help mend the wounds          of the past months. Bertram agrees to the proposal and, as a favor for          his bride-to-be, gives Lafeu the ring he had received from the woman he          thought was Diana. The King immediately recognizes the ring as the one which he had given          to Helena and, suspecting Bertram of plotting Helena's murder, orders          him to be arrested. Diana arrives with her mother and accuses Bertram          of seducing her and violating his promise to marry her after his wife's          death. Bertram replies by lying and trying to smear her reputation. When          all seems chaotic and confusing, Helena appears, quite alive, and very          pregnant. She tells Bertram she has fulfilled his conditions, and he,          seeing that she has indeed, answers that he is prepared to \"love          her dearly, ever, ever dearly.\"", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820042551/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmAllsWell06.asp"}
