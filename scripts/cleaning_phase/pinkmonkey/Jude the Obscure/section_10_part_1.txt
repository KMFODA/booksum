{"name": "part 3, CHAPTER 8", "summary": "CHAPTER 8 Summary After the wedding, Jude finds life in Melchester terribly depressing without Sue. He unrealistically hopes Sue will come back to him some days later. Hearing Aunt Drusilla is sick, he goes to Marygreen to visit her. At the same time, his old employer offers him work at Christminster. Aunt Drusilla is worse than Jude expected, and so he writes to Sue, suggesting she come and see her aunt. He offers to meet her at Alfredston Road on his way back from Christminster. At Christminster he is haunted by painful memories and decides not to stay there. He steps into a pub with his friend Tinker Taylor. At the bar, he is startled to see Arabella working as a barmaid. He goes up to her, and she explains that she returned from Australia three months ago. He arranges to meet Arabella later that evening in order to decide what to do. Therefore he has to miss his meeting with Sue. Notes The reappearance of Arabella at this juncture in the novel is an example of the fantastic coincidences that one encounters in Hardy's prose. There is a kind of inevitability about it: Jude cannot escape his fate. He is upset at his inability to keep the appointment with Sue at Alfredston. In his simplicity he thinks of this as a kind of divine punishment: \"Arabella was perhaps an intended intervention to punish him for his unauthorized love. For him it serves as a reminder that he is still morally and legally bound to Arabella", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051427/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmJude34.asp"}
