{"name": "part 4, CHAPTER 6", "summary": "CHAPTER 6 Summary Sue's absence is not immediately noticed, but when a month goes by and Sue does not return, rumors spread in Shaston about her having eloped. Phillotson admits the truth that he has consented to her living with her lover. The school committee is shocked and demands his resignation. Phillotson refuses, saying it is a personal matter, and the authorities dismiss him. Phillotson calls for a public meeting and it ends in a violent brawl. Phillotson then falls ill and takes to his bed. Gillingham informs Sue anonymously that Phillotson is ill, and Sue comes to visit him, although she is unaware of the actual reason for his dismissal. She spends some time with Phillotson, talks to him as a friend and tells him of Jude's plan to divorce Arabella. When Phillotson offers to forgive her and make up, Sue is alarmed and allows Phillotson to assume she is Jude's mistress. She leaves, and Phillotson later tells Gillingham of his intention to divorce Sue and thus give her back her freedom. Notes Phillotson is a man who has the courage of his convictions. He tries to be fair and honest. I was not her gaoler ,\" he tells the chairman of the school regarding Sue. But the consequences are disastrous for him. His career as a teacher is ruined and he becomes a figure of public scorn. Like Jude, Phillotson suffers for his kindness and his inability to hurt others; he himself is hurt instead. It is indeed ironic that although he has highly noble intentions of liberating his wife, he has instead brought upon himself unexpected problems. Sue, of course, is unaware of all the suffering she has caused him or that his career is in ruins because of her. The chapter ends with a hint that both Jude and Sue will soon be liberated from the bonds of their unsuitable marriages", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051427/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmJude40.asp"}
