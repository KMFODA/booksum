{"name": "part 3, CHAPTER 5", "summary": "CHAPTER 5 Summary In the cold light of morning, Sue takes stock of her situation and regrets her rashness in running away from the training college. She is also afraid of Phillotson's reaction to her departure. She decides to stay with a friend at Shaston, hoping to return later to the training college, after her escapade has been forgotten. Jude accompanies her to the station and is about to confess his love for her and tell her about Arabella, but Sue cautions him, saying that he is not to love her. The day after her departure Sue sends him a short note from Shaston, saying that she now grants him permission to love her. Jude goes to visit her at Shaston on Sunday and finds her sick in bed. Assuming that she is Jude's mistress, they have refused to take her back at the training college. Jude is distressed; he wants to tell her about Arabella but cannot gather the courage to do so. He reminds her of her engagement to Phillotson and resigns himself to a life of renunciation. But when he returns to Melchester, he receives another note from her, begging him to continue being her friend. She also requests him to meet her when she comes to Melchester for her belongings the following Saturday. Notes In this chapter Sue's indecisiveness is highlighted. When leaving Melchester, she tells Jude \"you mustn't love me, you are to like me, that's all,\" and yet she sends him a letter the very next day, apologizing and granting him the permission to love her. She does not realize the emotional dilemma she is causing for Jude by giving him conflicting messages. She knows she should not encourage him, as she is engaged to Phillotson, and yet she craves his admiration and support and cannot do without his friendship. Her expulsion from the college brings her life to a crisis point", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051427/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmJude31.asp"}
