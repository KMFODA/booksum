{"name": "part 1, CHAPTER 4", "summary": "CHAPTER 4 Summary While walking home Jude meets a quack doctor, Physician Vilbert. Jude questions him about Christminster and offers to get orders for Vilbert's pills and potions if Vilbert agrees to bring him his old Greek and Latin grammar texts. Jude works hard for two weeks and keeps his part of the bargain, but Vilbert lets him down. Intuitively Jude realizes the man is a fraud and is bitterly disappointed. In the meantime, Phillotson sends for his piano, which he left behind with Aunt Drusilla, and Jude secretly encloses a letter asking him to send his old grammar texts. But when they do arrive, Jude finds in dismay that instead of a general rule or formula for translating one language into another, each Latin or Greek word has to be committed to memory individually. Disillusioned by the enormity of the task, he falls into a fit of depression. Notes Jude's encounter with Vilbert demonstrates his easily trusting and naive nature. Yet he does not give up and contacts Phillotson, his old teacher. This is Jude's first attempt to enter the world of learning. Hardy emphasizes fundamental points of Jude's character: his enthusiasm, his willingness to work and his idealism. The reader also sees his dogged perseverance when the odds are against him", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051427/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmJude12.asp"}
