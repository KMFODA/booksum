{"name": "part 6, CHAPTER 7", "summary": "CHAPTER 7 Summary Arabella plots with her father to make Jude stay with them until she can remarry him. She arranges to have his belongings brought over, and all the while, they ply Jude with liquor. Finally, they arrange an-all night party to advertise her father's shop, and in the morning Arabella insists that Jude has promised to marry her. Jude, who is intoxicated and dazed, claims he has made no such promise. But when Mr. Donn questions Jude's \"honor,\" Jude gives in. He defends himself, claiming that he has never in his life intended to treat anyone with indignity. He is also too befuddled to make any more protests. They go off to the church and are remarried. When they return, Arabella is triumphant at having achieved her goal, while Jude is still drunk and in a daze. Notes The sordid scene of the all-night drinking party is a fitting background for this marriage. Arabella knows from experience how to make Jude do what she wants. The trap she lays is a clumsy one, but Jude is in a state of drunken despair and has no will to resist her. As in an earlier part of the book , Hardy again refers to Jude as a \"shorn Samson,\" implying that Jude is no match for Arabella's scheming. With the developments of this chapter, the two main characters of the novel have finally submitted to social pressure, which they have been fighting against all along. In doing this, they receive the approval of society, but they are inwardly crushed. The marriages that the two consent to lack the essential sentiment and can even be regarded as fraudulent", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051427/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmJude55.asp"}
