{"name": "part 1, CHAPTER 3", "summary": "CHAPTER 3 Summary Jude goes to a high point outside the village and finally climbs the roof of a barn, the Brown House. From there he strains his eyes to search for Christminster, but he sees nothing. Later in the evening, just before sunset, he returns to the barn and sees Christminster, radiant in the light of the setting sun. After this, he returns often to this vantagepoint to look at Christminster, sometimes by night. One time he meets a carter carrying a wagon of coal. The carter describes Christminster in glowing terms, as a center of learning and culture, although he himself has never been there. Jude is enchanted and concludes that Christminster is the place for him. Notes In this chapter the reader witnesses Jude's growing fascination with Christminster. The city acquired a tangibility, a permanence, a hold on his life. It becomes the object of his quest. He tries to keep a close watch on the city, though from a distance, and asks everyone he knows questions about it. The university becomes the symbol of all his unfulfilled aspirations. It represents, of course, an escape from his present unsatisfactory life, as well as a substitute religion for Jude. The carter's description of college life is an uneducated man's awe at the mysteries of learning and scholarship, and it whets Jude's appetite for study at Christminster. The city becomes for him a distant goal, all the more tempting because of its inaccessibility. It is a city of light,\" where \"the tree of knowledge grows\" and \"a castle manned by scholarship and religion", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051427/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmJude09.asp"}
