{"name": "part 4, CHAPTER 1", "summary": "CHAPTER 1 Summary Jude visits Sue at the school at Shaston. He waits in the empty schoolroom and plays the hymn that has so enchanted him. Sue comes in silently. She also plays it for him, and they are both so moved by its beauty that Jude comments that they are very much alike. They talk about a number of subjects, and Sue mentions her former friend, the university student, until Jude, stung by jealousy, accuses her of being \"a flirt. She is upset and tries to defend herself and her right to love. She talks of the conflicts she experiences and the difficulty of fitting into the conventional role that society reserves for women. They part and Sue invites him to visit her a week later. Jude wanders about town and nears Sue's house. Through the window he sees her take a photograph out of her workbox, gaze at it and hold it close to her heart. Although he is not sure, Jude hopes it is his own, and he knows he will see her again soon. Notes Sue as usual fluctuates in her behavior towards Jude. For the first time, he gets a bit impatient with her attitude of playing with his feelings. Sue becomes Hardy's mouthpiece, criticizing marriage as a social institution. The reader again realizes Sue's marriage is in trouble when she declares that some women find they cannot give their love \"continuously to the chamber-officer appointed by the bishop's license to receive it. The reader gets a glimpse of Sue as the \"new woman\" whose love of freedom makes it impossible to fit into the \"social moulds of civilization. With some insight, she speaks of Jude as a \"Joseph, the dreamer of dreams,\" a \"tragic Don Quixote\" and \"St. Stephen. Sue's words are prophetic, for this is the tragic role that love for her will condemn Jude to play", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051427/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmJude37.asp"}
