{"name": "part 2, CHAPTER 10", "summary": "CHAPTER 10 Summary Jude and Arabella have been fattening a pig all autumn, and it is now time for the killing. When Challow, the professional pig killer, is late, Jude is forced to kill the pig himself although he finds the job distasteful. Ignoring Arabella's instructions to let it bleed slowly, he kill the animal quickly and mercifully. The butcher arrives just as the pig is killed. That evening, returning home, Jude overhears Arabella's friends discussing how Arabella had tricked Jude with the pretended pregnancy and how they put her up to it. When Jude confronts Arabella, she is defiant and claims it is a woman's right to get her man by any means. Jude disagrees with her, arguing that to trap a man into such a marriage can have serious consequences, especially when it is unsuitable to both of them. Notes The scene of the killing of the pig was criticized by Hardy's contemporaries as being too violent and disgusting in its details. But apart from employing realism, Hardy is using this scene to underline the growing incompatibility between Jude and Arabella. Jude is horrified at the violence of the slaughter and cannot bear to prolong the pig's agony. Arabella scoffs at him for being a \"tender hearted fool. To her, the killing is a reality of rural life: \"Pigs must be killed\" and \"poor folks must live. The growing gulf between them will result in the end of their marriage. The scene also points out the significant differences in their characters. Jude's basic consideration for living creatures resurfaces in this scene. Arabella's reaction to Jude's accusation of her having trapped him is also revealing. She is quite unashamed at having lied to her prospective husband", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051427/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmJude18.asp"}
