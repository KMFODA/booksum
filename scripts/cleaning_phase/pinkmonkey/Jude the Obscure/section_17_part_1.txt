{"name": "part 6, CHAPTER 2", "summary": "CHAPTER 2 Summary Little Father Time is depressed and gloomy at their inability to find lodgings. Before they go to bed, Sue talks to him and tells him that another baby is on the way. Little Father Time is horrified at the thought of another mouth to feed and bitterly blames Sue for having ruined them. He declares it would be better if he and the other children were gone. The next morning Sue goes out early to meet Jude and to tell him that she has failed to find any lodgings. When they return, Sue goes to wake the children but finds that Little Father Time has hanged the younger children and then himself. Sue is overcome with horror and falls unconscious. Jude too is overcome with grief. Later there is a coroner's inquest and then a funeral, which Jude does not allow Sue to attend. Jude, however, learns that Sue has gone on her own to the graveyard and is telling the gravedigger to stop filling the grave and to show her the dead children. Jude takes her back home, but her agitation and wild grief have already affected her health. She gives birth to a stillborn child. Notes The events in this chapter bring the novel to a climax. The tragedy of the children's deaths has often been criticized as being overly sensational and melodramatic, straining all standards of credibility. The organ music from the College Chapel playing the 73rd Psalm, \"Truly God Is Loving Unto Israel,\" strikes another note of improbable irony. Hardy seems determined to force things with great speed towards an unhappy ending. In a book that is otherwise quite realistic, this chapter seems rather clumsy and excessive and has led some critics to condemn the novel as an artistic failure", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051427/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmJude52.asp"}
