{"name": "part 2, CHAPTER 3", "summary": "CHAPTER 3 Summary The next Sunday Jude attends the evening service at the Cathedral. Sue is also present at the same service and Jude observes her with growing interest and admiration. He still does not approach her. The organ music and his vision of Sue in church affects Jude greatly. He leaves the church spiritually and emotionally elevated. Some days earlier Sue went on an evening walk and impulsively bought some plaster statuettes of Venus and Apollo. She hides them in brown paper and tells her landlady that they are figures of St. Peter and Mary Magdalene. Later, she unwraps them and places them on a chest of drawers. At this time Jude is earnestly reading his Greek New Testament. Notes Hardy here uses contrasting scenes to show the extent of Jude's own illusions about Sue. He imagines Sue to be \"steeped body and soul in church sentiment\" because he has seen her in church. But the reader is shown Sue buying plaster reproductions of Greek gods, Venus and Apollo, representations of the female and male embodiments of physical beauty. She places them on her chest of drawers next to a Calvary print. This action is symbolic, and Hardy deliberately emphasizes the contrast between two different systems of belief. Far from being conventionally religions, Sue is influenced by rational agnostic thinkers like Gibbon and Swinburne. The reader is given a kind of warning about what her actual influence on Jude will be. Jude himself regards Sue as an agent of moral regeneration, but Hardy makes it clear that his motivation to see Sue is far from spiritual. Whatever Jude may tell himself, \"he could not altogether be blind to the real nature of the magnetism. Jude seems on the way to preparing new trouble for himself", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051427/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmJude22.asp"}
