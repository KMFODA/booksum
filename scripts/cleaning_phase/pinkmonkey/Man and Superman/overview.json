{"name": "overview", "summary": "In Man and Superman, George Bernard Shaw portrays  conventional courtship turned on its head. Traditionally, the  woman is hunted and submits to the man. In this play, man is  hunted by a relentless woman. Shaw believed that normally  women like Ann Whitefield pursue their intended husbands with  such persistence and subtlety that they lead the men to think  themselves as the pursuers. The plot really consists of two storylines. The first is the courtship  of John Tanner and Ann Whitefield. Tanner is a progressive  thinker; he is opposed to all things associated with tradition or  convention. At the start of the action, he has been appointed co-  guardian of Ann Whitefield, a duty he shares with an older man,  Roebuck Ramsden. Mr. Ramsden is a complete opposite of  Tanner, for he is established and conventional to the core, even  though he calls himself progressive. Both Tanner and Ramsden  appeal to their charge to select one of them to fulfil her fathers  wishes, but she will not make a choice. With the pretense of  respecting her fathers last wishes, she humbly says she would  like both to remain in their joint capacity as guardian. In reality,  she is simply setting her trap for Mr. Tanner. Secondary to this developing plot is the story of Violet Robinson  and Hector Malone. Violet is the sister of Octavius, a poet who is  hopelessly in love with Ann. She announces that she is pregnant;  then she announces that she is married, but she refuses to name  her husband. Later, it becomes evident  that  Violets husband is a wealthy American named Hector Malone,  whose father wishes him to marry a titled girl. Violet has  persuaded Hector to keep their marriage secret so that he will not  lose his wealth. In Act II, John Tanners car is broken down. Ann manipulates the  situation so that she can ride with him. He tells his chauffeur he  feels sorry for Octavius, saying Ann is playing with him in her  ruthless pursuit. His chauffeur tells him it is he, not Octavius, who  is the true goal of Miss Whitefield. In Act III, John Tanner flees his predicament  by traveling to Europe. There, he is kidnapped by a group of  marauding pirates. He falls asleep and has an extensive dream in  which he becomes Don Juan, sent to hell. In the underworld, Don  Juan has a discussion with his beloved Dona Ana de Ulloa , a Statue , and the Devil; they talk  about the universal questions relating to men, women, love, and  marriage. Through the dream, the playwright airs his views on  existence and evolution, using such ideas as that of a Life Force  and the Nietzchean vision of Superman. In this theory, women are  the chief instruments of nature, and men are used by women to  fulfill their own destinies. The Life Force that sustains existence  would cease were it not for this cycle. \"Superman\" is the concept  of man continually improving himself in each successive  generation. Don Juan finally leaves hell, since he believes he has work to do  in the world. The Devil tells Ana that Superman does not exist. She leaves in pursuit of a father to help her give birth to  Superman. At the end of the act, Tanner wakes to find that Ann  has found and rescued him. In the final act, Violet and Hector reveal their secret marriage and  Violet manipulates Hectors father into continued financial  support. John Tanner gives in to the inevitability of marriage and  agrees to wed Ann.
