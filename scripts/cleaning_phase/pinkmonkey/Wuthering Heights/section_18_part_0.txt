{"name": "Chapter 19", "summary": "Chapter 19 Summary Edgar writes a letter announcing Isabella's death. That evening Edgar arrives with his sickly nephew, Linton. Cathy is delighted to meet him. The same evening Joseph comes to fetch Linton, but Edgar refuses to send Linton to Wuthering Heights immediately because the boy is in such poor health. Joseph refuses to leave without him. Edgar forcefully shows Joseph to the door and promises to deliver Linton to Wuthering Heights the next morning. Joseph shouts back that Heathcliff himself will come to fetch Linton in the morning. Notes This chapter introduces Linton, the son of Isabella and Heathcliff. He is a sickly child -- pale, delicate, and effeminate. He strongly resembles his uncle, Edgar, in his appearance although there is a sickly peevishness in his countenance that Edgar has never possessed. In her treatment of her cousin, Cathy is seen as a tender and warm-hearted girl. She is sincerely fond of the poor, effeminate boy. Joseph arrives at the Grange to carry out Heathcliff's orders to bring his son to Wuthering Heights. This strongly suggests that Heathcliff has not forgotten his plan for revenge. He has said earlier in the novel that he would get the boy when he was ready for him. Edgar states that the child's health is \"very precarious;\" it is obvious that he fears for his nephew's well being among the rough occupants of Wuthering Heights. Edgar realizes, however, that he will not be able to keep Linton at the Grange against the wishes of his father.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210416215230/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmWuthering45.asp"}
