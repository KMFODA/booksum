{"name": "volume 1, CHAPTER 11", "summary": "CHAPTER 11-12 Summary Isabella and John Knightley, accompanied by their five children, come to Hartfield to spend ten days during the Christmas holidays. The pretty and gentle Isabella proves she is a devoted wife, a doting mother, and a dutiful daughter. She makes certain that the children do not disturb her father. Like Mr. Woodhouse, Isabella is delicate and overly concerned about her health and that of her family. She always consults Dr. Wingfield in London, just as Mr. Woodhouse consults Dr. Perry in Highbury. John Knightley, a popular lawyer by occupation, is a contrast to his amiable wife. He is reserved, short-tempered, and frank to the point of being blunt. Although acceptably attached to his own family, he has little patience with Mr. Woodhouse, especially over his excessive concern about food and health. While talking among themselves, Mr. Woodhouse refers to Miss Taylor's marriage with Mr. Weston. Isabella and John are happy about the marriage. John inquires about Weston's son, Frank Churchill. Mr. Woodhouse tells him about Frank's letter to Mrs. Weston in place of a personal visit. Isabella is sorry that Frank does not stay with his father. John blames Mr. Weston for neglecting his son and sacrificing his family life in the interest of his socializing with friends and neighbors. George Knightley is invited to dinner on the first day of the arrival of his brother at Hartfield. Emma is over-anxious to make up with Knightley, who has scolded her over her interference in Harriet's life. When George arrives, Emma is holding her eight-month old niece in her arms, and he lovingly takes the infant away from her. Emma teases him that though they love their nephews and nieces, they differ in their views about people. He then tells Emma that she should trust his judgement since he is sixteen years older. He also reminds her that she needs to be guided by reason, not imagination and fancy. During the evening, the brothers talk with each other about estate problems, and Mr. Woodhouse talks with his Isabella about health concerns. Emma tries to change the topic of conversation by talking about the Bates women, but no one listens. Isabella, however, brings up Miss Bates' niece, Jane Fairfax, whom she occasionally meets in London. She wishes that Jane were in Highbury, for she would be a good companion for Emma. Notes The Knightleys come from London to Hartfield to spend the Christmas holidays, and Isabella and her husband are seen for the first time in the novel. Jane Austen's purpose is to present an atmosphere of happy family life with everyone enjoying one another and having pleasant conversation about topics such as family estates and neighbors. It is significant that Emma makes use of this family atmosphere to please George Knightley, who has been upset with her over her meddling and fanciful ideas. The Woodhouse sisters are contrasted in the chapter. Unlike the willful Emma, Isabella is gentle and amiable. She has also taken after her father in her preoccupation about health matters. Both young ladies, however, are lovely in appearance and manners; both are also genuinely kind to and concerned about their father. Jane Fairfax is again mentioned in the chapter. Isabella states that she sometimes sees her in London, but wishes she would spend more time in Highbury. She feels that since Jane is the same age as Emma, she would be a perfect companion for her sister. It is important to note that the letter from Frank Churchill bears the date of September 28. Since this letter arrives shortly after the book begins, a time reference is given, and the reader understands that approximately three months have passed since Miss Taylor's marriage", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820053844/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmEmma24.asp"}
