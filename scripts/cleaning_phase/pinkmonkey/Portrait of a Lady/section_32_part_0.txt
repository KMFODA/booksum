{"name": "Chapter 33", "summary": "Chapter 33 After finishing crying, Isabel goes to tell her aunt of her engagement with Gilbert Osmond. Mrs. Touchett has guessed it. She immediately realizes she has been deceived by Madame Merle who promised to help prevent the engagement thereby keeping Mrs. Touchett from action. Mrs. Touchett says she might not have acted to prevent it, but perhaps Ralph would have had something to say. Mrs. Touchett asks Isabel why shes so interested in someone like Gilbert Osmond--\"theres nothing of him.\" Isabel responds, \"Then he cant hurt me.\" Ralph arrives two days later. Isabel knows he has been told and waits for him to bring the matter up, but he doesnt. He looks dreadful ill. She has never thought of his illness as being so dangerous as now. She dismisses his low opinion of her engagement--which she only guesses--as conventional. For her, all cousins are supposed to be critical of ones marriage. In the meantime, Isabel sees Gilbert Osmond every day. They meet each other in the Cascine, a park outside of Florence. Notes This short chapter serves to give the reader Ralph Touchetts insight into the engagement of Isabel and Gilbert. He hates the news. It seems in fact to sicken him further. Yet he knows he cant say anything since it wont change Isabels mind and because it wont it would only cause problems between them. On the other hand, he also cant bring himself to congratulate her. So he goes for three days without saying anything to her. In regard to the Madame Merle-Gilbert Osmond plot, the chapter brings more to light. Mrs. Touchett is quite sure of the scheme and says as much to Isabel. In this way, the idea of the scheme is brought out in the open. Isabel rejects it now, but later will recall it and realize its true.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820033733/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmPortraitLady51.asp"}
