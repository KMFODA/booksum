{"name": "Chapter 13", "summary": "Chapter 13 Summary Lucys funeral is arranged. According to legal matters, as both Lucy and Mrs. Westenra die, bereft of heir, the estate passes to Arthur. Van Helsing wants to perform an operation on Lucy the next morning. He puts a crucifix on the coffin but the very next morning the crucifix disappears. In the meantime, Jonathan sees Dracula but a younger version. Lastly, this chapter ends the tale of strange women in black, preying on children. Notes Lucy is dead almost ten days before her marriage. She has become one of Draculas. The inference is 1) The crucifix, which Van Helsing has left on her coffin, has disappeared. 2) A strange woman was preying on small children. As it is seen in the next few chapters, Lucy has become an Un- dead. Jonathan sees a younger Dracula. Preying on the blood of many men has made Dracula younger, and again the super human aspect of the antagonist is observed.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820041120/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmDracula20.asp"}
