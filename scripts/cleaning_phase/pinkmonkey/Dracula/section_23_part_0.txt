Count Dracula, he informs, has gone back to Transylvania as the band has destroyed his last box so thats why he has been forced to flee. He has gone by ship but Van Helsing assures him that the battle has just begun and in the end they will win.

He has sailed Czarina Catherina, and he is on the sea. There is a change in Mina, the band notices. Draculas ship is going to take at least three weeks to reach Varna. So the band plans to travel overland in three days. They plan to leave on the 17th so that they reach one day before Draculas ship reaches.
