{"name": "Scene 4", "summary": "Act IV, Scene 4 Belarius, along with Guiderius and Arviragus, are standing in front of their cave. All around them, the sounds of British and Roman troops getting ready for battle can be heard. The two lads are all fired up, and tell their father that they wish to join the British troops. Belarius tries in vain to persuade them not to do so; he even suggests that they retreat higher up into the hills to safety, as the death of Cloten was too recent, and would bring disaster to them. He puts forward many arguments against them joining the army, but the brothers are determined, and Belarius can do nothing but submit to their demand. Notes As Belarius had earlier pointed out, it is evident that blood will tell; the two young lads respond to the military sounds around them by asking their father's blessing to join the army. As Arviragus says, they have lived away from the world for so long that he now feels ashamed that he has never fought in a battle or even ridden a horse properly. Belarius is fearful that Cloten's death will be discovered and that they will be blamed. He also fears that they will finally learn who they are. Yet he cannot keep them separated from the world they have been born into but never experienced. Therefore, when Belarius finds that they will not listen to his arguments, he has no option but to give in.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820053313/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmCymbeline35.asp"}
