{"name": "Scene 1", "summary": "Act IV, Scene 1 Dressed in a garment belonging to Posthumus, Cloten arrives near the cave of Belarius, thinking it is the place where Imogen is to meet Posthumus. He thinks that since Posthumus's clothes fit him well, so Imogen would suit him, also. He cannot comprehend how she could reject him and choose Posthumus when all the advantages of birth, position, and wealth are on his side. He vows to behead Posthumus, molest Imogen and then send her back to her father's home. He knows Cymbeline will be angry with him, but he can depend on his mother to sort out the problems. His horse tied safely, he draws his sword and enters the cave. Notes Cloten, driven mad with rage at Imogen's refusal to accept his love, now plans revenge. His love has turned sour, as it were, and he reveals himself to be wicked enough to plan to murder Posthumus and to assault Imogen. The love he claims to have for Imogen is actually his pride that is hurt, and he is willing to go to any lengths to acquire his object of desire, including violence. This soliloquy reveals Cloten at his most driven and perverse. He displaces responsibility for his actions on his mother who will placate the King if Cloten rough-handles his daughter.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820053313/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmCymbeline31.asp"}
