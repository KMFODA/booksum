{"name": "Scene 2", "summary": "ACT IV, SCENE 2 Summary In the rebel camp at Sardis, Brutus receives Titinius and Pindarus, two officers who report that Cassius is approaching. When Pindarus gives Brutus a letter from Cassius, Brutus tells the soldier that his master has offended him and he wants an explanation; it is obvious that the two men are no longer very close. Lucilius then tells Brutus that Cassius received him coolly, showing no warmth of friendship or affection. Brutus' response suggests that he now has some distrust for Cassius. When Cassius arrives, he claims that Brutus has wronged him. The two men argue out in the open. They then decide to move their discussion inside the tent so that others do not see fighting. Brutus orders Lucilius and Titinius to stand guard at the door of the tent. Notes This scene shifts to a rebel camp of the assassins and focuses on the developing rift between Brutus and Cassius. The mood is tense as the doubt and discord between the two men is displayed. Both of them feel they have been wronged by the other. If they continue to spend their time fighting with one another rather than fighting their mutual enemy, they will be quickly overcome by the cold, calculating triumvirs.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820051427/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmJuliusCaesar27.asp"}
