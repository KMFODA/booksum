{"name": "CHAPTER 30", "summary": "CHAPTER 30 Summary One evening as Tess and Angel transport the milk, Angel points out an old mansion that used to belong to the D'Urberville family. Tess takes it as a sign that it is time to tell Angel about her past. When he begs her again to marry him, she says that she needs to tell him some things about herself. She discloses that her ancestors are D'Urbervilles; she assumes Angel will be upset, for she knows his dislike towards old families and the D'Urbervilles in particular. Angel dismisses her apprehension and proclaims that her background will not affect their love. He also believes that such a relationship will impress his mother and further Tess's cause with her. Tess's strong desire to reveal the rest of her story without prevarication weakens. She tells Angel she will marry him and then begins to cry. Angel kisses his fiancee passionately and then recalls that he has seen her before at the dance in Marlott. Notes In this chapter, a panicked Tess tries to disclose all of her past misadventure to Angel, but her courage fails her. Instead, she only manages to tell him that she is from the D'Urberville family, a fact that she thinks may discourage Angel's love. Quite the opposite happens; Angel realizes that this association will make Tess more welcomed as his wife by his mother and society. Undone by this reaction on Angel's part, Tess looses all resolve to stay single. She tells Angel she will marry him. Angel rejoices at her acceptance. Tess, however, sobs over breaking her vow of remaining single and failing to reveal her past. Angel is perplexed by her tears but is delighted in her passionate kiss. It begins to rain on the engaged couple. They are quickly drenched, but proclaim that their love will be able to face all the odds.
