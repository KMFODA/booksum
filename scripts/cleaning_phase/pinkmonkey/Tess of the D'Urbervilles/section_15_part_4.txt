{"name": "CHAPTER 41", "summary": "CHAPTER 41 Summary After leaving home, Tess finds only irregular work as a dairymaid, except during harvest time. As winter approaches, she can barely make ends meet and must use some of the money Angel has left her. Since her parents believe she is living comfortably with her new husband again, they ask her for financial help, for their cottage is in serious need of repairs. She sends them the last of her money. In November, Tess heads to the farm where Marian is working, hoping to find employment for herself there. Along the way, she meets the same man whom Angel had struck. When pursued by him, she hides in the woods and wishes she were dead. Notes Tess sends the last of her money to her needy parents. Since she is too proud to approach Angel's parents for help, she travels upland, hoping to find work. She is miserable, lonely, and tormented. When she sees the pathetic sight of some pheasants writhing in pain, she identifies with them. To relieve them of their suffering, she kills them with her hands", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820050202/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmTessD48.asp"}
