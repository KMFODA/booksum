{"name": "CHAPTER 43", "summary": "CHAPTER 43 Summary At Flintcomb-Ash Farm, life is difficult for Tess. She learns that her employer is the Trantridge man, who is particularly hard on her. She and Marian are forced to work in the fields, through wind, rain, and cold, digging up rutabagas. When the snow begins, they are transferred into the barns, where the work is even more difficult. During the winter, Izz Huett comes to the farm and is also employed. She tells Marian about her encounter with Angel and the invitation that he offered her. When Tess hears the story, she decides she must write to Angel in Brazil. Notes The only happiness that Tess experiences at Flintcomb-Ash is the memories of Talbothay's and the company of Marian. Everything else is dreary -- the work, the landscape, the weather, and the atmosphere. Fate makes those things even worse, for Tess's employer turns out to be the man from Trantridge, who delights in making her life even harder", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820050202/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmTessD52.asp"}
