{"name": "CHAPTER 28", "summary": "CHAPTER 28 Summary Angel continues to try and convince Tess to marry him. Believing her reticence is due to a lack of confidence in her status, Angel continually praises Tess and encourages her in her studies. She, however, continues to say she cannot marry him. Angel, on the other hand, is more convinced that ever that in time Tess is sure to accept his proposal. Tess, fearing that Angel's insistence will break her resolve, decides to tell Angel about herself. Her conscience will not let her continue to love him without telling him the truth. Notes Angel continues his pursuit of Tess and spends time encouraging and teaching her. He is very impressed with her quickness and ability to learn. In fact, he is amazed to see Tess \"pick up his vocabulary, his accent, and fragments of his knowledge, to a surprising extent. He is obviously trying to change Tess into the image his parents want to see in her; he is trying to make her into a Christian lady, again suggesting that this relationship is not going to be a smooth one. As time passes, Tess realizes that her love for Angel cannot be easily checked. She longs to accept his proposal for marriage, but she knows her past prevents her from becoming his wife. As Hardy puts it, she is enduring both \"positive pain and positive pleasure. Because her resistance to Angel is breaking under her desire for him, Tess resolves to tell him about her past. Her conscience will not let her continue to live a lie, but she is worried about Angel's reaction. Tess hopes that love will reign over rationality", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820050202/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmTessD37.asp"}
