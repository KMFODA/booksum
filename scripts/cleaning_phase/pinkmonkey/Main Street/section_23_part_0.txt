Though the days are very hot they are unable to go to the lake cottage because the other doctors are away. The unbearable heat makes every one very touchy. She snaps at the clerk who tries to make suggestions. She feels vexed by Uncle Whittier's comments and does not laugh at Dave Dyers clownish tricks.

She finds him dressed sloppily and his table manners to be very uncouth. He has not shaved for three days and his nails are ill shaped.
