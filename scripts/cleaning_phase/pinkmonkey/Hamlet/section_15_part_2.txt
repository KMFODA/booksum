{"name": "ACT IV, SCENE 6", "summary": "ACT IV, SCENE 6 Summary In another room in the castle, sailors give Horatio letters from Hamlet. The Prince writes that two pirate ships have attacked his own ship bound for England. Hamlet was taken aboard one of the pirate ships as a prisoner; fortunately, the pirates have been merciful towards him and helped him return to Elsinore. Hamlet writes that Horatio must deliver the other letter to the King and then immediately come to meet him without further delay since he has much to tell him about Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Horatio asks the sailors to direct him to Hamlet's refuge and promises to reward them for their labor. Notes This scene lends pace and movement to the action. The arrival of the sailors with the news that Hamlet has returned to Denmark indicates that the final climax of the action is not far removed. The Prince will be surprised, however, to learn that much has occurred since his departure, including the return of Laertes to avenge his father and the insanity of his beloved Ophelia", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820040441/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmHamlet30.asp"}
