{"name": "Act V, Scene 1", "summary": "Act V, Scene 1 Summary The kings forces have gathered, and Henry, Hal, Blunt, Lancaster, and Falstaff are at camp. Henry and Hal discuss the weather, which is worsening. The king is not worried, for \"nothing can seem foul\" to those that win. Worcester and Vernon arrive. Worcester reiterates the complaints of the Percies. The king replies these are fine sounding excuses that merely disguise their desire for rebellion. Prince Hal then offers a proposal. He suggests that he and Hotspur settle the matter in a personal duel between themselves, thereby saving innocent lives. The king forbids this, but again promises the rebels full pardon if they accept his peace offer. If they do not, he is prepared to destroy them. Vernon and Worcester leave with the offer. Hal is sure that Hotspur and Douglas will not accept the offer. The king is of a similar mind and gives orders to prepare for battle. When the king leaves, Falstaff asks Hal to help him out if he sees him during the battle. Hal tells him not to be afraid; after all, he \" God a death\" . When Hal is gone, Falstaff says that the debt is not yet due, and while he pretends that honor urges him on, honor to him is nothing but an empty word.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180820040441/http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmHenry4131.asp"}
