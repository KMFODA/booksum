{"name": "overview", "summary": "The story  begins at England. We are introduced to Fogg, a very precise man who regularly  goes to the Reform Club every evening. At one such visit to the club to play cards,  he gets into a conversation with his fellow card players as to whether it is possible  to go around the world in eighty days following this schedule: RouteTravel  Method Duration  London  / Suezrail and ship7 days  Suez / Bombayship13  days  Bombay / Calcuttarail  and elephant3 days  Calcutta  / Hong Kongship13 days  Hong Kong / Yokohamaship6  days  Yokohama / San Franciscoship22  days  San Francisco / New Yorkrail7  days  New York / Londonship9  days   Total 80  days He believes that it is possible and he is challenged  to complete the adventure. This is the beginning of the entire plot and from then  on we see how Fogg goes around the world and we witness the amazing adventures  that he has with his companions. The main plot is based on Foggs travels, while other such plots merely support  the central theme Fix, the detective follows Fogg all over. He believes that Fogg  is the bank robber who has robbed a great sum from the bank of England. He puts  obstacles in Foggs path just so that he can arrest him whenever he gets the warrant  from England. The suspicion that Fogg might be a clever gentleman robber is  the sub-theme of the book and the author makes the reader also suspicious. Passepartout  too wonders whether his master might be a robber though in his heart he has ample  trust in Foggs integrity. The plot moves ahead with Fogg striving through  various obstacles to reach London in time. He goes through Brindisi, Suez, Bombay,  Calcutta, Hong Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco, New York and finally Liverpool. Fix arrests Fogg at Liverpool and this delays our hero. He thinks that he has  missed the deadline and hasn't reached London in time when in reality he reached  a full day earlier. Thus Fogg wins the wager and in the course of his travels,  finds himself a worthy charming, beautiful wife too.
