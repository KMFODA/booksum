{"name": "overview", "summary": "The sub-title of Middlemarch is \"A study of Provincial Life.\"  Both the title and the sub-title make it clear that the subject is  not a character or even a family, but the lives of people in a  provincial town. Thus, one has roughly four stories, all set in  and around Middlemarch, with at least one major character from  one story being present in another, and hence threads linking all  the tales together. One has the story of Dorothea Brooke being  given prominence in the Prelude. Dorothea is a young girl with great ideals and ambitions. She  would like to dedicate her life to some great cause, which would  reform the society around her. Having no clear notion about  how to do it, she marries Edward Casaubon, the elderly  clergymen, who seems to represent knowledge and piety. Disillusion soon follows. She comes in contact with his  dependent cousin, Will. She enjoys his company. Casaubon is  jealous. He makes a will forbidding her marriage to Will, and  dies of a heart ailment. The will creates a scandal in that rigid  society. The two decide to remain apart. Ultimately, after much  soul searching, they marry. Dorotheas ideals are toned down,  and she devotes her life to Will, his political career, and their  children. The second story is about Tertius Lydgate - a young, handsome,  clever and idealistic doctor. He is highly -connected but has no  fortune. He is attractive to the town beauty Rosamond Vincy,  who wants to escape from her \"bourgeois\" background into the  nobility. They marry, here too, disillusion follows. Lydgate is forced to give up his ideals to preserve his marriage. They get into debt. Lydgate is involved in a medical scandal  involving his rich sponsor, Nicholas Bulstrode. His only  supporter is Dorothea, who has been his patient earlier. He gives  in to his wifes wish to live in London, and ends his days as a  physician of the rich. He dies early, and Rosamond marries a  rich man. Like Dorothea, he too gives up his ideals, but his end  is far bleaker. The third story is that of Mary Garth a plain intelligent girl, who  works as a housekeeper. Her family stands for the ideal of hard  work and self-respect, Fred, Rosamonds idle scamp of a  brother has loved Mary from childhood. Unlike Rosamond, he  is warm, affectionate, and capable of improvement. His love for  Mary makes him change himself into a hard working farm-  manager, and they marry and live happily in prosperity. The last major story is that of Nicholas Bulstrode Lydgate's  sponsor. Bulstrode has once been an ardent Dissident preacher  in a sect in the city. He has then been patronized by a rich  Jewish pawnbroker. After the Jews death he married his widow  who is in search of her runaway daughter. Bulstrode suppresses  news of the daughter and thus has the whole property for  himself. The lady dies. He then moves away and makes a fresh  start as a \"respectable\" businessman and banker, away from the  taint of the pawnshop. He marries Harriet Vincy aunt of Fred  and Rosamond, and becomes a pillar of Middlemarch society. Inevitably, his past catches up in the form of a seedy black  mailer, Raffles. The drunken Raffles confides the facts in  several Middlemarchers, including Will Ladislaw, whose  mother has been disinherited through Bulstrode. Raffles then  dies while being nursed by Bulstrode and attended by Dr. Lydgate. The circumstances point towards the guilt of Bulstrode  in Raffles death. Lydgate is also involved. The ensuing scandal  ruins Bulstrode, who gives up public life, and decides to leave  the town. Lydgate services because Dorothea and her friends  believe in his innocence. These four stories also involve a host of lesser characters and  recreate the rich and dense texture of the life of a town and the  nearly villages.
