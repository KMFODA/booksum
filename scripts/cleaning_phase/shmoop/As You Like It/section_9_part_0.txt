{"name": "Act 2, Scene 7", "summary": "Meanwhile, Duke Senior and his band of merry men are readying to settle down to dinner and they're looking for Jaques.<PARAGRAPH>Jaques arrives  and, shockingly, he's in a good mood.<PARAGRAPH>Jaques says he ran into a \"motley fool\" in the forest.    Hmm.  Sounds like Jaques bumped into Touchstone out in the woods, don't you think?<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Jaques hung out with the \"motley fool\" for about an hour and was amused by the guy's philosophical musings on the passage of time and the nature of women.<PARAGRAPH>Jaques bags on Touchstone and says that fools are the only people allowed to mock others without getting into trouble.<PARAGRAPH>Brain Snack:  Jaques is talking about the freedom of being a \"licensed fool\" .  A licensed fool is a guy who literally has a license to say whatever he wants without getting into trouble .  Paid fools were pretty common in the households of royalty and the nobility in Shakespeare's day.<PARAGRAPH>Jaques says if he were a licensed fool, he could point out everybody's flaws and cure \"th'infected world\" of all its problems.<PARAGRAPH>Duke Senior's not buying any of it--he points out that Jaques is more likely to infect the entire world  than to cure it.<PARAGRAPH>As Jaques responds to the Duke's insult, Orlando bursts in on the dinner party and yells \"Forebear, and eat no more!\"<PARAGRAPH>Jaques calls Orlando a \"cock\"  and Duke Senior asks whether Orlando is distressed or just raised to have no manners.<PARAGRAPH>Orlando is hell-bent on stabbing somebody if they eat, though the Duke insists he should take it easy.<PARAGRAPH>Orlando can't take it easy, because he and Adam are starving.  Still, he does apologize, saying everything in the forest is so brutish, he must have become brutish himself.<PARAGRAPH>The Duke understands, and he invites Orlando to eat with them.  Everyone promises to wait while Orlando runs off to get Adam.<PARAGRAPH>Duke Senior takes the opportunity to comment that misery seems to be a universal experience.<PARAGRAPH>Jaques delivers the play's most famous speech and declares, \"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players.\" He goes on to detail the seven ages of man, as follows:  You start as an infant, then a whining schoolboy, progress to a lover, then a soldier, then a contented middle-aged man, followed by a kinda-old guy with spectacles, and finally a very, very old guy who has lost his senses and looks and acts like a helpless baby again.  <PARAGRAPH>Just as Jaques is saying that old men are like infants, Orlando enters carrying his old servant, Adam... who is as helpless as a baby.<PARAGRAPH>The Duke doesn't want to bother them with questions before eating, so they all feast .<PARAGRAPH>Amiens sings a song about how even the harsh winter wind isn't as terrible as the way human beings can sometimes treat each other.  <PARAGRAPH>During the song, Orlando whispers to Duke Senior that he is the son of Sir Rowland de Boys.<PARAGRAPH>The Duke recognizes old man Rowland's features in the boy and is delighted to have him. Duke Senior was a good friend of Sir Rowland, so he says Orlando and Adam are welcome in his cave anytime.<PARAGRAPH>The Duke says he wants to hear the story of how Adam and Orlando ended up homeless and hungry in the forest.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125200037/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/as-you-like-it/summary/act-2-scene-7"}
