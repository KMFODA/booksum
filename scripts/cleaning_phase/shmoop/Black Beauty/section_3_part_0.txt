{"name": "Chapter 4", "summary": "At last, Farmer Grey says goodbye to \"Darkie\" and Black Beauty leaves his childhood home, moving to Birtwick Park, an estate owned by Squire Gordon.<PARAGRAPH>Birtwick seems like horse heaven. Beauty tells us that his new box in the stable is \"clean, sweet, and airy\" .<PARAGRAPH>Beauty has some new roommates at Squire Gordon's, too--Merrylegs, a fat grey pony, and Ginger, a cranky yet beautiful chestnut mare. Merrylegs seems friendly and easygoing, but Ginger's a little peeved because Beauty's taken her place in the best box in the stable: \"I do not want to have words with a young thing like you\" , she tells him. Ooh, burn.<PARAGRAPH>Merrylegs explains that Ginger's a little bad-tempered and tends to bite and snap. He's hopeful that Beauty isn't a biter, and Beauty assures him that he's not. \"It is just a bad habit,\" Merrylegs says of Ginger. \"She says no one was ever kind to her, and why should she not bite?\" . Turns out if you mistreat a young horse like Ginger, they develop habits like biting and kicking.<PARAGRAPH>Oh, and according to Merrylegs, who's seen it all at twelve years old, there's \"no better place for a horse all round the country\"  than Birtwick Park.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205154804/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/black-beauty/summary/chapter-4"}
