As she does, Lucio stands in the background providing commentary and whispering words of advice like Isabella should stop being so \"cold\" and should use her feminine wiles to change Angelo's mind.<PARAGRAPH>Angelo insists that it's \"the law\" and not him that condemns Claudius to die.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella wants to know why her brother is being singled out.  Plenty of others have committed the same crime and nobody else has been punished.<PARAGRAPH>Angelo reasons that the law has been taking a brief cat nap but, now that it's \"awake,\" all those other fornicators better watch out.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella begs Angelo to be merciful and he replies that he's showing his mercy by implementing the law.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella declares that men who go around playing God are as ridiculous as apes who go around imitating man's behavior.<PARAGRAPH>Angelo says he'll think about sparing Claudio's life and that Isabella should come back tomorrow.<PARAGRAPH>Isabella says she wants to offer Angelo a bribe and Angelo is all \"Really, what kind of bribe do you have in mind?\"  <PARAGRAPH>Isabella explains that her bribe is a heavenly gift.  She's going to...pray for Angelo.  There's nothing better than a virgin's prayers, insists Isabella.  Not even gold.<PARAGRAPH>Angelo, who is clearly disappointed that Isabella didn't offer him some other kind of \"heavenly\" gift , tells Isabella to return the next day so they can talk about it some more.<PARAGRAPH>When Isabella leaves, Angelo reveals to the audience that he's in lust with Isabella and that his desire makes him a lot like a piece of smelly road kill rotting in the sun.  .)<PARAGRAPH>Angelo realizes that Isabella's virtue is what turns him on.  If she wasn't so chaste, he probably wouldn't be so hot for her.  A \"strumpet\"  would never get him this worked up.
