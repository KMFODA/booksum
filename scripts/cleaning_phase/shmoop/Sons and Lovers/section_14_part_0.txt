He can't do much of anything, really.<PARAGRAPH>To numb the pain, he starts drinking and knocking around the town.<PARAGRAPH>This isn't going to end well, is it? Let's find out.<PARAGRAPH>Maybe there's a chance for our man Paul yet.<PARAGRAPH>One night, Paul stumbles drunk into his apartment and stares into the fire. He wonders about his mother's struggle and what it was all for.<PARAGRAPH>He realizes he's destroying himself, and starts to resist it.<PARAGRAPH>He tells himself that his mother is in him, and that he has to stay alive for her sake.<PARAGRAPH>He also tells himself he can either paint or beget children, which would carry on his mother's legacy.<PARAGRAPH>One day, he runs into Miriam at church and they go for a walk together. Then he leads her back to his apartment building for supper.

Miriam keeps hoping Paul will really express a profound interest in marrying her, but he won't take charge like that.<PARAGRAPH>Paul similarly keeps hoping Miriam will take charge of the sitch.<PARAGRAPH>In the end, neither one will compromise, so they part.<PARAGRAPH>If they had Facebook in those days, they might be \"In a relationship,\" but clearly, \"It's complicated.\"<PARAGRAPH>Once Paul's alone again, he gets all dark and twisty.<PARAGRAPH>He whispers \"mother\" out loud a few times.<PARAGRAPH>He almost wants to kill himself to be near her again...<PARAGRAPH>Oh boy.<PARAGRAPH>At long last, he decides that he won't give in to death. So he turns with clenched fists and walks quickly back toward the town.<PARAGRAPH>We wish you the best, good sir.<PARAGRAPH>We don't believe you'll achieve it, with what we've seen of Paul so far.
