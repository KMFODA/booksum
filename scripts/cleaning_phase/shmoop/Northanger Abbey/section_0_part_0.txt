{"name": "Chapter 1", "summary": "Catherine Morland is born, which is good since she is the star of this book.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator introduces us to her family. Dad's a clergyman and Mom takes care of Catherine and her nine siblings.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator helpfully informs us that Catherine is a pretty bad heroine: no suffering or tragedies or anything like that.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine is awkward and tomboyish and generally unremarkable as a kid.<PARAGRAPH>Then Catherine hits her teen years and gets better looking. Good for her.<PARAGRAPH>She also becomes interested in fashion, boys, and reading popular Gothic fiction instead of \"boring\" educational junk - which is like saying she got obsessed with Twilight and thought the classics like, well, Jane Austen, were really lame.<PARAGRAPH>Catherine finds school pretty dull and can't really boast of a talent like drawing or music.<PARAGRAPH>Sadly, Catherine lives in a small community and has yet to meet any handsome young men. Her improving looks are going to waste.<PARAGRAPH>But her neighbors, the Allens, don't have any children and decide to invite Catherine, now seventeen, to visit Bath with them. Catherine is super-excited.<PARAGRAPH>Fun fact: Bath is famous for its hot springs and was a popular spa town/fashionable tourist destination in early nineteenth century Britain.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211004144536/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/northanger-abbey/summary/chapter-1"}
