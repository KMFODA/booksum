{"name": "Chapter 2", "summary": "After moving in to Norland, Mrs. John Dashwood  and her henpecked husband try to decide how much financial support to give to his sisters.<PARAGRAPH>Though John initially has a rather generous plan to give each of the girls a thousand pounds , his wife has other ideas - she complains that to remove a total of three thousand pounds from their young son's inheritance would be too cruel.<PARAGRAPH>John protests that it was his father's last wish that he should take care of his half-sisters. Again, Fanny brushes him off, saying that the dying man probably didn't even known what he was talking about.<PARAGRAPH>John then lowers the amount to five hundred pounds each - surely that's enough? Fanny agrees that's plenty of money. In fact, to her, fifteen hundred pounds altogether is still too much money to part with.<PARAGRAPH>OK, back to the drawing board. John has the idea that perhaps he should give money to Mrs. Dashwood, instead, to benefit the whole family - say, one hundred pounds a year.<PARAGRAPH>Once again, Fanny shoots him down; after all, she says cruelly, what if Mrs. Dashwood lives more than fifteen years? Then they would be out more than fifteen hundred pounds in total.<PARAGRAPH>John agrees - after all, paying an annuity is such a hassle.<PARAGRAPH>In the end, the couple settles on a simple solution: they won't give the Dashwood any money, except for the occasional small gift here and there. After all, they reason, what can a household of four women need any money for?<PARAGRAPH>Fanny, of course, has to have the final word - she bemoans the fact that Mrs. Dashwood got all the nice china and furniture from Norland .", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210421140324/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/sense-and-sensibility/summary/chapter-2"}
