{"name": "Chapter 1", "summary": "\"The Monkey's Paw\" starts off the way many good scary stories start - with a dark and stormy night.<PARAGRAPH>We're in England, inside Laburnam Villa, where things are not dark and stormy. Actually, they are quite cheery - there's even a fire burning in the fireplace.<PARAGRAPH>Now we meet the White family. The father and mother both have white hair. Their grown son, Herbert White, is probably in his mid-20s.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. White and Herbert are playing chess, while Mrs. White knits near that fire we were talking about. What could be more homey and comfy than this?<PARAGRAPH>Mr. White makes a wrong move and Herbert wins the game, putting Mr. White in a bad mood, but just for a second.<PARAGRAPH>Soon Sergeant-Major Morris arrives. The Whites welcome him and offer him some whiskey. The alcohol makes Morris talkative, and he tells the White stories of his time in India.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently he has been away in India for the past 21 years, serving in the British Army.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. White brings up something from an earlier conversation with Morris - a monkey's paw.<PARAGRAPH>Morris says the paw is \"magic\" . As he takes it out of his pocket, he says, \"To look at, it's just an ordinary little paw, dried to a mummy\" .<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. White is grossed out by the paw, but Herbert holds it and checks it out, then Mr. White takes it.<PARAGRAPH>Morris tells them the legend of the paw: \"It had a spell put on it by an old fakir, a very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it\" .<PARAGRAPH>Morris says he got the paw from the first man who wished on it. Guess what that man's third wish was. It was \"for death\" . <PARAGRAPH>Morris says he made three wishes on the paw too, and his wishes came true, but he isn't sure he would wish again if he had the chance.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, Morris chucks the paw into the fire.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. White grabs it out before it burns. He asks Morris to let him have the paw.<PARAGRAPH>Morris warns him against it, but then he gives him instruction on using the paw: 1. Hold paw in hand. 2. Make wish. <PARAGRAPH>After Morris leaves, Mr. White holds the paw and says, \"I don't know what to wish for, and that's a fact  It seems to me I've got all I want\" . Oh really? Then why did you want the cursed paw in the first place?<PARAGRAPH>Herbert suggests wishing for two hundred pounds . Two hundred pounds is the amount Mr. White needs to finish paying back the bank for his house.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. White holds the paw and makes the wish. The paw moves in his hand - eek! He screams.<PARAGRAPH>Herbert makes some jokes about the paw. He doesn't believe it's magic.<PARAGRAPH>After his parents go to bed, Herbert sees  the \"horrible\" face of a monkey in the fire. He throws water on the face, then gives the paw a squeeze and goes to bed.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219173656/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/monkeys-paw/summary/chapter-1"}
