He looks down on the Eloi, who don't realize that they are like cattle.<PARAGRAPH>He gets sad about the passing of human intelligence, calling it suicide: people were smart enough to make the world a more comfortable place - but as the world got more comfortable, people became less smart.<PARAGRAPH>He thinks that only a huge variety of needs and dangers keep people smart and strong. Without the dangers, the Eloi drifted toward \"feeble prettiness\" and the Morlocks drifted toward \"mere mechanical industry\" .<PARAGRAPH>This would be a fine system if it were stable. But clearly the Morlocks ran out of food, and so they turned to the obvious replacement: the Eloi. This is the Time Traveller's final theory on this issue.<PARAGRAPH>The Time Traveller takes another nap, then goes to open the Sphinx and get his Time Machine.<PARAGRAPH>When he gets to the Sphinx, though, the doors are open.<PARAGRAPH>The Time Traveller throws away his club. He suspects a trap, but he thinks he can deal with the Morlocks since he has matches.<PARAGRAPH>But when the Morlocks try to trap him, he discovers that his matches will only light on the box, which was stolen in the last chapter.<PARAGRAPH>Still, the Time Traveller manages to fight the Morlocks off while he reattaches the levers.<PARAGRAPH>And then: time travel!", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210628004820/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/time-machine-hg-wells/summary/chapter-10"}
