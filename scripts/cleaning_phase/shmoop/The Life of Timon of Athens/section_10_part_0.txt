He stands outside the city walls and rants about how awful the people inside are.<PARAGRAPH>Timon's got a laundry list of bad wishes for the city. We'll warn you right here: it ain't pretty.<PARAGRAPH>Wives should become slutty, says Timon. Children, go ahead and be disobedient. Slaves, steal from your masters. Oh yeah, and everything in Athens should rot and decay.<PARAGRAPH>As if that weren't enough, Timon wants to drive the point home: Athens = bad. So, he removes everything he has from Athens, even his clothes. That's one way to make a point.<PARAGRAPH>Timon's off to the woods, where no one from Athens can bug him.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210301093311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/timon-of-athens/summary/act-4-scene-1"}
