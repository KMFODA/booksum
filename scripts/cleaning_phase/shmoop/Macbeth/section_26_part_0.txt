{"name": "Act 5, Scene 7", "summary": "Macbeth appears on stage and compares himself to a bear in a bear-baiting contest .<PARAGRAPH>History Snack: Bear-baiting is a blood sport that involves chaining a bear to a stake and setting a pack of dogs on it.<PARAGRAPH>Elizabethans thought this was good clean family fun. Bear-baiting arenas were located in the same neighborhoods as the theaters, just in case anyone wanted to take in a play and then top off their day of fun with a little animal cruelty.<PARAGRAPH>Young Siward enters and...quickly dies. Macbeth talks some evil smack over the dead body, to the effect of \"your swords and weapons can't touch me because you're of woman born.\"<PARAGRAPH>Macduff runs on stage looking for Macbeth and screams for the evil tyrant Macbeth to come out and show his ugly face.<PARAGRAPH>Macduff is hot to kill Macbeth with his own sword because he'll likely be haunted by the ghosts of his wife and kids if he doesn't.<PARAGRAPH>He begs \"fortune\" to let him find Macbeth so he can stab him in the guts.<PARAGRAPH>Siward and Malcolm note that Macbeth's castle has basically been surrendered without a fight. They're winning battles with little effort, mainly because the people they're fighting aren't really trying. Even Macbeth's soldiers hate him. So. Many.
