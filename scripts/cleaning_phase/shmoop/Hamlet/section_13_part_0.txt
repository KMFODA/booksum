{"name": "Act IV, Scene iii", "summary": "Now it's Claudius' turn to demand that Hamlet tell him where Polonius' corpse is.<PARAGRAPH>Hamlet responds with morbid jokes, pointing out that Polonius is at \"supper\"--that is, he's being eaten by worms for dinner. Charming.<PARAGRAPH>Hamlet, again speaking in the veiled terms of seeming madness, describes the cycle of life, where a worm can eat a king, a fish can eat that worm, and a man can eat that fish, thus eating a king, who inevitably passes through the digestive system of another man.<PARAGRAPH>Basically, Hamlet calls Claudius a piece of poo.<PARAGRAPH>And, anyway, the whole \"find the body\" game will be a lot simpler once Polonius' corpse begins to leave a reeking scent trail.<PARAGRAPH>After Hamlet hints that the body is in the stairs leading to the lobby, Claudius sends the attendants off to find it.<PARAGRAPH>And he tells Hamlet that he's being shipped off to England with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern for his own good, and also as a princely time-out for having caused so much trouble.<PARAGRAPH>Claudius, left alone, reveals that he has arranged to have Hamlet killed once he reaches England.<PARAGRAPH>Cue the evil laugh.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210227102129/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/hamlet/summary/act-iv-scene-iii"}
