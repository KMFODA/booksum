{"name": "Chapter Four: The Samples", "summary": "Moliere comes back to escort D'Artagnan and Porthos to Percerin's rooms.<PARAGRAPH>Percerin is busy examining a piece of fabric, but goes to greet the guests.<PARAGRAPH>D'Artagnan introduces the new customer: Monsieur le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds.<PARAGRAPH>Percerin is not happy with the idea of making a suit for Porthos within two days. He tells D'Artagnan it is impossible.<PARAGRAPH>A certain Monsieur d'Herblay, better known as Aramis, chimes in and asks Percerin to make the suit for Porthos. <PARAGRAPH>He asks Percerin if the King is having five suits made - one in brocade, one in hunting cloth, one in velvet, one in satin, and one in Florentine stuffs.<PARAGRAPH>The information Aramis is after is the cut and the look of each suit of clothes.<PARAGRAPH>Percerin is terrified. This is apparently an audacious request.<PARAGRAPH>Aramis reveals the plan: Fouquet wants to present the King with a portrait  on the day of the fete, and it will be best if the King in the portrait is dressed exactly as the real king. Le Brun has been commissioned to paint the portrait.<PARAGRAPH>Percerin is aghast at the idea of giving out information about the King's clothes.<PARAGRAPH>Aramis convinces Percerin to give up the information.<PARAGRAPH>Le Brun begins to paint, but Aramis interrupts him, saying that he has failed to capture the finer shades of each fabric. He asks Percerin for fabric samples from each suit, ostensibly so Le Brun will have more time to study the colors.<PARAGRAPH>Clearly something is afoot. D'Artagnan is suspicious. Why does Aramis want fabric samples?<PARAGRAPH>Fed up, D'Artagnan says he is going to join Porthos.<PARAGRAPH>Aramis joins D'Artagnan and the two friends leave together.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507123624/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/man-in-the-iron-mask/summary/chapter-four-the-samples"}
