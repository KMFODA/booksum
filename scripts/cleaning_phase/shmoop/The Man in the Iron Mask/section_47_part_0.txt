{"name": "Chapter Forty-Eight: The Grotto", "summary": "Biscarrat and his companions halt in front of the grotto.<PARAGRAPH>They are certain that the dogs have gone in, but are suspicious that they do not hear them. Each of the men calls for the dogs, but get no answer.<PARAGRAPH>Biscarrat tells the men that he will go investigate the grotto. He goes alone, saying there is no point in more than one person risking his life.<PARAGRAPH>After he enters, he feels the muzzle of a musket on his chest. At the same moment one of the servants brings his knife towards Biscarrat's throat, to be halted by Porthos, who refuses to have Biscarrat killed.<PARAGRAPH>Aramis comes up to Biscarrat from behind and presses a handkerchief over his mouth, warning him not to say anything.<PARAGRAPH>Biscarrat is taken aback. He thought Porthos and Aramis were in the fort.<PARAGRAPH>Biscarrat swears not to tell his companions what happened, but also swears to try and stop them from similarly entering the grotto.<PARAGRAPH>Biscarrat returns to his friends and is very reticent about what he has seen in the grotto. His friends, believing Biscarrat to be holding out on them, want to enter the grotto. He begs them not to enter, but they pay no attention.<PARAGRAPH>Biscarrat waits while his friends enter, and presently there are sounds of gunfire.<PARAGRAPH>The men stagger back cursing Biscarrat for not warning them of the ambush. Four men have been killed.<PARAGRAPH>The men yell at Biscarrat to tell them who is in the grotto. One man, wounded to the death, demands Biscarrat reveal the identities of the men in the grotto. He attempts to kill Biscarrat and Biscarrat welcomes the murder, but the man dies before he can strike a fatal blow.<PARAGRAPH>Distraught, Biscarrat throws away his sword and runs into the grotto crying that he is a dishonorable man and deserves to die.<PARAGRAPH>He lives.<PARAGRAPH>The remaining men who follow are not so lucky. Only six men, including Biscarrat, remain after the gunfire.<PARAGRAPH>Reinforcements arrive led by a captain.

He enters only to be killed.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507123624/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/man-in-the-iron-mask/summary/chapter-forty-eight-the-grotto"}
