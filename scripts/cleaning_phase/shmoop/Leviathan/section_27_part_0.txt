It is, in fact, not betrayal but a brilliant plan.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn and Alek bicker about the relative brilliance of this plan. Like they do about everything.<PARAGRAPH>Alek tells her to ask Volger to come down under truce, which is what she does.<PARAGRAPH>Newkirk is hovering over them in a Huxley--ready to drop an aerial bomb.<PARAGRAPH>Volger descends from the walker, and Deryn and Alek both hope the negotiations work because both sides could destroy each other.
