{"name": "Chapter 16", "summary": "Deryn runs through the front of the London Zoo, where all the animals are upset because of the Leviathan's presence.<PARAGRAPH>A woman stops her and asks if Deryn is an airman.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn realizes that the scientist is a woman. It's kind of funny that Deryn is so shocked, right?<PARAGRAPH>The woman introduces herself as Dr. Barlow.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn sees two younger scientists carrying a carefully packed crate between them: mysterious cargo.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Barlow brings out a dogesque beast, whom she introduces as Tazza, her pet. He's a Tasmanian tiger, and is a natural animal, not fabricated.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn leads Dr. Barlow, the two younger scientists, and Tazza to the Leviathan, which Dr. Barlow says doesn't look happy--Deryn can see that the Leviathan is upset, but she assures Dr. Barlow it's just because it's so near the ground.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn begins to explain the Leviathan to Dr. Barlow. As it turns out though, Dr. Barlow fabricated this species of airship, so Deryn feels pretty dumb.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn notices that many of the ground men seem untrained, which is a big problem that could get a lot of people killed--so Dr. Barlow uses her message parrot  to send a message from Deryn to the captain about this.<PARAGRAPH>Deryn and Dr. Barlow observe the tactics the captain uses to get the untrained men to let go.<PARAGRAPH>When Dr. Barlow compliments her, Deryn asks the scientist to put in a good word with the captain due to the weight issue.<PARAGRAPH>This goes a bit south when Dr. Barlow says she and Tazza would love a cabin boy of their very own--Deryn's not excited at this prospect.<PARAGRAPH>She's also not excited by the prospect of another woman on board--another woman who might notice things men wouldn't.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210507031130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/leviathan/summary/chapter-16"}
