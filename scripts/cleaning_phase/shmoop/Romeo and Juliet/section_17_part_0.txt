{"name": "Act 3, Scene 5", "summary": "Romeo and Juliet wake after their first and  only night together.<PARAGRAPH>They don't want to say good-bye, but they know Romeo will be killed if he gets caught in Verona, especially if he also happens to be in Juliet's bed.<PARAGRAPH>Before Juliet has time to fix her hair or anything, her mother comes in. They manage to have a conversation about \"that villain Romeo\" in which Lady Capulet misinterprets 99.9% of everything that Juliet says.<PARAGRAPH>Lady Capulet announces her big, exciting news: in two days, Juliet will be marrying Paris.<PARAGRAPH>No way, says Juliet, being a typical thirteen-year-old.<PARAGRAPH>Lady Capulet throws up her hands and basically says \"Wait 'til your father gets home.\"<PARAGRAPH>When he does get home, he's all pleased with himself for arranging such a great marriage for her, so he's surprised when Juliet rains on his parental-control parade.<PARAGRAPH>Lord Capulet blows up. When verbally abusing Juliet doesn't work, he tries a different tactic. If she doesn't marry Paris, he says, he'll throw her out in the street; she can beg for food or starve.<PARAGRAPH>After Lord Capulet storms out, Juliet turns to her mother for help. How could a mother turn her own daughter out of the house? Juliet begs her mother to find a way even to delay the marriage with Paris.<PARAGRAPH>But Lady Capulet just storms out, too.<PARAGRAPH>How about the Nurse?<PARAGRAPH>Juliet makes a case for not abandoning the hubby: She's already married, so marrying Paris would be a sin against God, as well as an unthinkable betrayal of Romeo.<PARAGRAPH>Maaaaaaybe--but marrying Paris would be a step up on the social ladder. He's better looking and a much better catch. Also, he's not a hated enemy, and um, there's no other option.<PARAGRAPH>Unless you count starving on the street which, clearly, the Nurse does not.<PARAGRAPH>Juliet cannot believe this is happening. Even the nurse isn't on her side anymore.<PARAGRAPH>Juliet has only one ally left: Friar Laurence. If he can't help her, suicide might be her only option.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210514145017/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/romeo-and-juliet/summary/act-3-scene-5"}
