Turns out the poor woman was really the Virgin Mary and she blessed St. Ogg for his kindness. After this, Ogg was able to go out safely in his boat, no matter the weather, and he often rescued poor people during storms.<PARAGRAPH>In the present, St. Ogg's is a quiet little town with farms and mills and little shops and markets. The town doesn't think too much about its lengthy history; church-going is more a matter of habit and custom than anything else.<PARAGRAPH>We now arrive at the Glegg house, which has lots of windows, all the better for Mrs. Glegg to spy on her neighbors.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Glegg is in the wool business and he spends his days thinking about wool, natural history, how he doesn't understand women , and how he can save money.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Glegg is really good natured and finds his wife's moods confusing.
