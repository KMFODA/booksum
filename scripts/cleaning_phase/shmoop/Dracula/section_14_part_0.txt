{"name": "Chapter 15", "summary": "Dr. Seward is totally blown away that Van Helsing could say something like that about Lucy. Besides, she's dead.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing says he'll prove it: They'll go spend the night in the churchyard.<PARAGRAPH>After dinner, they go into the Westenra tomb. Van Helsing pulls out a screwdriver to open the coffin.<PARAGRAPH>Lucy's not in it!<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Seward still has a logical explanation: Someone has stolen the body.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing shrugs, and they go out to the churchyard to wait.<PARAGRAPH>Several hours later, Dr. Seward sees something white moving among the trees, and Van Helsing finds a child that had been dumped in the leaves.<PARAGRAPH>They leave the child with the police and go back to London.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing wants Dr. Seward to come out and check the coffin again.<PARAGRAPH>This seems pretty stupid to Dr. Seward, who has already seen that the coffin is empty.<PARAGRAPH>But when they get there, Lucy's body is inside!<PARAGRAPH>And her body is totally intact, even though she's been dead a week.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Seward finally gets it: Lucy is a vampire.<PARAGRAPH>And he's okay with stabbing a stake through her heart and cutting off her head, if that's what it takes.<PARAGRAPH>But Van Helsing wants to let Arthur in on the secret, in case he finds out about it later.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing leaves a note for Dr. Seward saying that he's going to spend the night in the churchyard watching Lucy. He's leaving the note in case anything happens to him.<PARAGRAPH>He asks that Dr. Seward take over if he should die, and try to find and kill Dracula.<PARAGRAPH>After a good night's sleep, Dr. Seward doesn't believe it anymore--he thinks maybe Van Helsing is crazy.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing has summoned Arthur and Quincey.<PARAGRAPH>He wants them all to wait up that night in the churchyard, go into Lucy's tomb, and cut off her head. No problem, right?<PARAGRAPH>Of course, Arthur objects.<PARAGRAPH>But they agree at least to go with him to the churchyard.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219141110/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/dracula/summary/chapter-15"}
