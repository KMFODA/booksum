{"name": "Chapter 23", "summary": "Dr. Seward notes that Jonathan's brown hair has turned white overnight from the shock of what happened to Mina.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing, meanwhile, has been studying up on Dracula's life--his real life, hundreds of years ago.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, our undead friend was quite the scholar in his day. But, Van Helsing insists, his brain stopped developing when he became a vampire. So now he's got a \"child-brain\"--Dracula is hung up on routine and habit.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, they get a telegram from Mina. She warns them that she saw Dracula leaving Carfax , and that he's headed south into the city.<PARAGRAPH>Jonathan is psyched to have a chance to kill the monster.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing warns them all to keep their anti-vampire weapons ready.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly Dracula appears--Jonathan lunges forward with a huge knife, slashing at the vampire. Dracula dodges in time, and Jonathan just gets his clothes.<PARAGRAPH>The others move forward, holding their crucifixes up.<PARAGRAPH>Dracula retreats, but yells taunts at them as he goes, and tells them that he's got Mina in his power.<PARAGRAPH>He escapes.<PARAGRAPH>They go home to Mina, who is relieved that they're all safe.<PARAGRAPH>They get Mina up to speed on everything that has happened.<PARAGRAPH>Mina reminds them that even Dracula should be an object of pity--like Lucy, he's trapped in his undead state, so that when they kill him, they'll be freeing his soul.<PARAGRAPH>During the night, Mina wakes up and tells Jonathan that she hears someone in the hallway.<PARAGRAPH>It's just Quincey, who is taking his turn guarding their room. Can't be too careful.<PARAGRAPH>At dawn the next morning, Mina says she wants to see Van Helsing immediately.<PARAGRAPH>She feels that Dracula's influence over her is weak around dawn, so she asks Van Helsing to hypnotize her.<PARAGRAPH>She figures that they can use her as a kind of Dracula-barometer--maybe, by hypnotizing her, they can take advantage of the connection between them to figure out what the vampire is up to.<PARAGRAPH>It works! They learn that Dracula is asleep, in the dark, on a ship, and that the ship's anchor is still down.<PARAGRAPH>They wake Mina back up: Dracula is trying to escape from them!<PARAGRAPH>But which ship is it?<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing is worried about time, now. Dracula can live for centuries, but Mina is mortal.<PARAGRAPH>If she dies, even of natural causes, before Dracula is killed, she'll become a vampire.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219141110/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/dracula/summary/chapter-23"}
