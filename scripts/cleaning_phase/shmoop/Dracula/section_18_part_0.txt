{"name": "Chapter 19", "summary": "Quincey and Van Helsing ask why Seward didn't allow Renfield to go, and Seward says he was afraid Renfield wanted to go help Dracula somehow.<PARAGRAPH>They use a skeleton key to get into Carfax.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing hands out crucifixes and pieces of blessed communion wafers.<PARAGRAPH>They go into the chapel to check things out.<PARAGRAPH>Dracula hasn't called a cleaning service in a while: The place is covered with inches of dust and it smells like a locker room after a muggy summer season combined with ancient evil.<PARAGRAPH>They only find twenty-nine boxes. Where could the other twenty-one be?<PARAGRAPH>The place is filled with rats. Luckily, they brought a supply of terrier dogs, which were bred to kill rats. Problem solved.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, they still have the other problem of the twenty-one missing boxes of dirt and the bloodthirsty vampire on the loose.<PARAGRAPH>They go back to Seward's house and go to bed.<PARAGRAPH>Jonathan Harker notices that Mina looks a little pale.<PARAGRAPH>Van Helsing and Dr. Seward have a little chat about Renfield.<PARAGRAPH>Renfield is very sullen again and doesn't want to talk to either of them.<PARAGRAPH>Seward assures Van Helsing that he thinks it's for the best that Mina stay out of the way of their vampire-hunting. It's not a lady's business.<PARAGRAPH>Mina is in a bad mood this morning, maybe because her husband won't tell her anything that happened the night before.<PARAGRAPH>She describes what she did while they were at the Count's house snooping around.<PARAGRAPH>She says she went to bed when they left, but didn't feel sleepy.<PARAGRAPH>She could hear the dogs barking next door  and Renfield praying very loudly from his room below. She thought she saw a mist coming toward the house when she looked out the window.<PARAGRAPH>When she went to sleep she had weird dreams--something about a \"pillar of cloud\" in her room that seemed to have two red eyes.<PARAGRAPH>Again, Mina doesn't sleep well, so she asks Dr. Seward to give her something to help her sleep.<PARAGRAPH>History Snack! Sleep aids in 1897 meant combinations of opium and alcohol. That stuff will knock you out. And it's addictive.<PARAGRAPH>She takes the sleep aid and falls asleep.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219141110/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/dracula/summary/chapter-19"}
