It contains a book and a sealed piece of paper.<PARAGRAPH>The book doesn't seem to offer much in terms of obvious directions.<PARAGRAPH>Squire Trelawney is the one who figures out that it's an account book: it has all of the captain's wages from when he first started as a pirate to much larger sums now.<PARAGRAPH>The sealed paper includes something much more promising: a map of an island with three crosses of red ink, two on the northern part and one in the southwest. Next to the southwest cross it says: \"Bulk of treasure here\" .<PARAGRAPH>The handwriting on the map is different from the captain's. It also contains some more specific directions that Jim can't understand.<PARAGRAPH>Squire Trelawney tells Doctor Livesey to give up his medical practice right now: they're going to sail away looking for treasure in three weeks' time.
