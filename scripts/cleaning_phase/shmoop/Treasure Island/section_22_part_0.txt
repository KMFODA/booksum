{"name": "Chapter 23", "summary": "Jim finds that Ben Gunn's boat is light and floats well, but it's really hard to handle. He's really struggling to get the boat to go in the right direction.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily for Jim, the current brings his tiny boat right to the Hispaniola.<PARAGRAPH>Jim realizes that if he cuts the cope while it's pulled tight, it'll snap back and pull both him and his boat out of the water.<PARAGRAPH>Again, luckily for Jim, the current shifts the Hispaniola so the rope is slack and he can cut it without danger.<PARAGRAPH>During all this, Jim hears voices coming from the cabin of the ship.<PARAGRAPH>He overhears Israel Hands talking to another pirate, the man with the red nightcap  who was the only surviving attacker on the fort earlier in the day.<PARAGRAPH>They're incredibly angry and drunk.<PARAGRAPH>On shore Jim can see a campfire with the remaining pirates. Someone is singing that old shanty \"Dead Man's Chest.\"<PARAGRAPH>Jim saws through the last strands of rope attaching the Hispaniola to its anchor.<PARAGRAPH>He's having trouble rowing his little boat away from the much-larger ship because of the strong currents.<PARAGRAPH>Jim grabs hold of a loose piece of rope.<PARAGRAPH>He suddenly feels curious: what's happening in the cabin?<PARAGRAPH>He climbs up for a last look.<PARAGRAPH>He only has time to glimpse Israel Hands and the red-hatted pirate trying to strangle each other. The fact that they're fighting like this is lucky - it means neither of them have noticed that the Hispaniola has started to move quickly on the current.<PARAGRAPH>Jim's little boat suddenly lurches: it's being carried in the wake of the Hispaniola.<PARAGRAPH>Jim worries that he's going to be swept out to open sea.<PARAGRAPH>The Hispaniola turns so sharply that even the two fighting drunks inside realize something is wrong.<PARAGRAPH>Jim tries to hide in the bottom of his boat, sure that he's about to run aground on rocks and die.<PARAGRAPH>He finally grows so exhausted that he falls asleep in his boat and dreams of his old life back at the Admiral Benbow Inn.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219191616/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/treasure-island-book/summary/chapter-23"}
