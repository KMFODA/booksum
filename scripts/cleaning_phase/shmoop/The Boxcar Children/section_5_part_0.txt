{"name": "Chapter 6", "summary": "It's time for dinner, which means Henry is finally going to reveal what's in those bundles. Nothing too exciting: bread, milk, dried meat, and a bone for the dog.<PARAGRAPH>Dinner is bread soaked in milk. Jessie declares how fun it is to eat with spoons. Poor Jessie.<PARAGRAPH>Henry tells the kids about his day: He walked into town and stumbled upon a doctor mowing his lawn. Henry offered to help and, boom, he was hired. You go, Henry.<PARAGRAPH>Impressed with Henry's lawn-mowing skills, the doctor tells Henry he wants him to work every day.<PARAGRAPH>The doctor paid Henry $1 for his work, and the cook gave him a huge bag of cookies. Score.<PARAGRAPH>In town, Henry bought a tablecloth, which Violet can't wait to hem to the right length.<PARAGRAPH>The meal finished, the girls wash the dishes, and Henry heads back into town.<PARAGRAPH>That afternoon, Jessie makes a broom, and Violet works on the tablecloth. Watch and Benny take a nap.<PARAGRAPH>Henry returns later in the day with a special treat: butter. The children feast.<PARAGRAPH>Jessie asks Henry about his day. He washed the doctor's car and the windows. Very industrious.<PARAGRAPH>Hot and tired from the day's work, Henry looks at the brook and wonders if he could build a swimming pool.<PARAGRAPH>Benny offers his wheels for the pool for some reason, but Henry decides he'll make a cart so Benny can haul stones.<PARAGRAPH>Bedtime. Everyone falls asleep straight away except for Henry, who's up obsessing over the pool. Suddenly, he notices that the dog is on high alert.<PARAGRAPH>Watch starts to growl, and now Jessie is awake. She and Henry are frightened, and they decide to close the door to the boxcar.<PARAGRAPH>Uh-oh, Watch is still growling--Jessie wonders if there's a person out in the woods.<PARAGRAPH>A stick breaks, and Watch begins to bark. If there really is a person in the woods, now they know about the boxcar. Yikes.<PARAGRAPH>Poor, frightened Henry grabs the broom and waits expectantly for an intruder ... but no one comes. Whew.<PARAGRAPH>After a long wait, Henry opens the boxcar door. Watch promptly goes to sleep, letting Henry and Jessie know all is well once more.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, they go to sleep, too.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219155156/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/boxcar-children/summary/chapter-6"}
