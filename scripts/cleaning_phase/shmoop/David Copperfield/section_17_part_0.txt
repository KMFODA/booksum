{"name": "Chapter 18", "summary": "David looks back on his school days.<PARAGRAPH>David is not the least successful boy in school, but he's still a long way off from being the first one .<PARAGRAPH>Adams is not as superior as Steerforth, but David still wonders what he'll be when he leaves the school - he's sure that Adam will be amazing.<PARAGRAPH>David has a crush on Miss Shepherd, who boards at a school run by the Misses Nettingalls.<PARAGRAPH>The Misses Nettingalls' pupils go to the same church that Doctor Strong's students attend.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, David and Miss Shepherd also go to the same dancing school.<PARAGRAPH>David gives Miss Shepherd little presents: brazil nuts, cookies, and oranges.<PARAGRAPH>Slowly, however, they grow apart: David hears that Miss Shepherd wishes David didn't stare at her so much.<PARAGRAPH>Worse still, Miss Shepherd has a crush on Jones, one of his schoolfellows.<PARAGRAPH>One day, David happens to walk past the Misses Nettingalls' girls and sees Miss Shepherd making a face at him and then laughing to her friends. He's done with her.<PARAGRAPH>David grows older, and decides that he's above the Misses Nettingalls' young ladies. He's too good for them and for dancing school.<PARAGRAPH>Doctor Strong calls David a promising scholar, and Mr. Dick and Miss Betsey are both very proud of him.<PARAGRAPH>A young butcher in the town threatens to beat up Doctor Strong's boys because they think they're so great.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he stops a couple of the younger boys and punches them.<PARAGRAPH>This butcher challenges David directly, and so David decides to fight him.<PARAGRAPH>The butcher totally kicks David's butt, and he has to stay home for a couple of days to recover.<PARAGRAPH>Agnes nurses David. She agrees that David had no choice but to fight the butcher .<PARAGRAPH>Adams graduates from the school and goes on to become a lawyer.<PARAGRAPH>David no longer thinks Adams is so very great: he suddenly seems very meek and not at all grand.<PARAGRAPH>Now David is head boy! He feels about a million miles away from the little boy he was when he first arrived at Doctor Strong's school.<PARAGRAPH>And Agnes has also grown up: she is like a calm, sweet sister to David.<PARAGRAPH>David has fallen in love yet again, this time, with the eldest Miss Larkins.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Larkins is a tall woman of about thirty, and David is head over heels for her.<PARAGRAPH>David plans to go to a ball that he knows Miss Larkins will also attend.<PARAGRAPH>When he can't be with Miss Larkins, he tries to catch the eye of her father, Mr. Larkin.<PARAGRAPH>David worries that, at 17, he may be too young for Miss Larkins. But so what! He'll be 21 soon!<PARAGRAPH>Fantasies run through David's head of Miss Betsey giving him her blessing to marry Miss Larkins and offering him a fortune of 20,000 pounds.<PARAGRAPH>Sadly, in real life, he also notices that Miss Larkins is very popular with the army officers in the town: he starts to worry that she won't even notice him.<PARAGRAPH>So, David finally makes it to the ball and asks Miss Larkins to dance.<PARAGRAPH>David tells Miss Larkins that he doesn't want to dance with anyone else.<PARAGRAPH>They do dance together, and David is pleased that he has snatched Miss Larkins from the arms of Captain Bailey.<PARAGRAPH>David asks Miss Larkins for a flower, which he then kisses and pins to his chest. <PARAGRAPH>Miss Larkins tells David that he is very bold, and then asks to be escorted back to Captain Bailey.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Larkins later approaches David with a plain, somewhat older gentleman on her arm.<PARAGRAPH>She introduces David to Mr. Chestle, who is in the hops trade .<PARAGRAPH>David thinks that Mr. Chestle must be some friend of the family, and is very proud of the introduction.<PARAGRAPH>He's absolutely thrilled at this attention from Miss Larkins.<PARAGRAPH>That is, until several weeks later, when Agnes tells him at dinner that Miss Larkins has just gotten married.<PARAGRAPH>To Captain Bailey? Nope, to Mr. Chestle.<PARAGRAPH>David is miserable, stops wearing his best clothes, and throws away Miss Larkins' flower.<PARAGRAPH>Tired of the whole dating scene, David challenges the butcher to another fight and beats him.<PARAGRAPH>He feels a bit better. And that's David's rise to the age of 17!", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200929182814/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/david-copperfield/summary/chapter-18"}
