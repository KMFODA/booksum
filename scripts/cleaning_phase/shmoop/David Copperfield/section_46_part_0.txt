If Emily is hiding from Mr. Peggotty, it is because of shame.<PARAGRAPH>David and Mr. Peggotty both agree that Emily will probably wind up in London.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Peggotty asks Martha to help them find Emily.<PARAGRAPH>Martha asks if Mr. Peggotty will trust her to bring Emily to him if she ever finds her?<PARAGRAPH>David and Mr. Peggotty both say they do trust her.<PARAGRAPH>Martha promises that she will do this task faithfully.<PARAGRAPH>David tells Martha everything they know so far about Emily's movements since she ran away.<PARAGRAPH>He writes down his and Mr. Peggotty's addresses so that she can get in touch if she hears any news.<PARAGRAPH>David tries to offer Martha some money, but she will absolutely not accept.<PARAGRAPH>Martha refuses the money because she worries that, if she accepts money, they will trust her less.<PARAGRAPH>She is honored to be trusted again for the first time in so long.<PARAGRAPH>Martha touches Mr. Peggotty briefly and then goes on her way.<PARAGRAPH>David arrives home at around midnight.<PARAGRAPH>He sees that his aunt's cottage is lit up, and he goes to see if anything is the matter.<PARAGRAPH>David is shocked to see a man standing in her yard.<PARAGRAPH>The man is eating and drinking as though he is starving.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey comes out and presses some money into his hand.<PARAGRAPH>The man tells her it's not enough for him to go.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey asks how he can be so cruel to her, when she can spare him nothing else?<PARAGRAPH>The man tells her that he has grown shabby and pathetic.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Betsey replies that he has taken most of her money and treated her cruelly.
