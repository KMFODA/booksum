That's what Minnie and Joram the carpenter are doing right now.<PARAGRAPH>David asks how little Emily is.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Omer tells David that he'll be glad when Emily is safely married - right now, she seems unsettled and in low spirits.<PARAGRAPH>Ham Peggotty has apparently already furnished the house they're going to be living in, but the marriage has been postponed because of Mr. Barkis's illness.<PARAGRAPH>The longer Mr. Barkis stays ill, without either dying or getting better, the more opportunity little Emily has to doubt her choices.<PARAGRAPH>Little Emily is clinging closer and closer to Mr. Peggotty, as though she is afraid of what she might do if she lets him go.<PARAGRAPH>David asks if Mr. Omer has heard anything about Martha Endell.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Omer says it's a sad story, since he thinks Martha didn't mean to do any harm.<PARAGRAPH>At that moment, Minnie comes home with Mr. Joram.<PARAGRAPH>They tell Mr. Omer and David that Mr. Barkis is unconscious, and that he seems near death.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Mr. Chillip the doctor is there, but he has given up on Mr. Barkis's life.<PARAGRAPH>David decides to go over to Mr. Barkis's house immediately.<PARAGRAPH>He finds Mr. Peggotty, Ham Peggotty, and little Emily sitting in the house.<PARAGRAPH>Little Emily is covering her face with her hands.
