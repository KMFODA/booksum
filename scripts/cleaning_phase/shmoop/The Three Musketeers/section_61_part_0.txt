{"name": "Chapter Sixty-One: The Carmelite Convent at B\u00e9thune", "summary": "Milady reaches the convent, stopping only to send Cardinal Richelieu a note informing him that the Duke will not be sending reinforcements to La Rochelle.<PARAGRAPH>The abbess in charge of the convent meets Milady and the two women a lovely chat. Milady entertains her host with anecdotes from court life, and tries to determine if the abbess is a cardinalist or royalist.<PARAGRAPH>Once Milady establishes that the abbess is a royalist, she immediately begins playing the part of one of the Cardinal's persecuted victims.<PARAGRAPH>The abbess reveals that there is another one of the Cardinal's persecuted victims staying at the convent! What a coincidence!<PARAGRAPH>Milady asks to meet this other victim. The abbess says Milady ought to rest first; they will rouse her later.<PARAGRAPH>Shortly afterwards, Constance and Milady encounter each other for the first time. They survey each other carefully, noting that they are each beautiful, but in different ways.<PARAGRAPH>Constance says she has been at the convent for six months, but that she expects to be leaving soon.<PARAGRAPH>Being the sweet woman that she is, Constance then offers to put in a good word with the higher-ups in order for Milady to leave the convent. Milady bemoans that even the Queen cannot do much for her.<PARAGRAPH>Not so, Constance protests, and then in the next breath asks if Milady is acquainted with the Queen.<PARAGRAPH>Milady says no, but indicates that they have mutual friends. She lists them, baiting Constance carefully, until she admits to being friends with D'Artagnan.<PARAGRAPH>Constance immediately suspects that Milady was once D'Artagnan's mistress! She's right on the mark, but Milady denies it, saying that the two of them were only ever \"just friends.\"<PARAGRAPH>Milady is so happy to have found Constance, the woman whom D'Artagnan loves.<PARAGRAPH>Constance is overcome and the friendship is sealed. The two women hug each other.<PARAGRAPH>She confesses to Milady that she is expecting D'Artagnan himself any day now.<PARAGRAPH>Milady does not believe it; D'Artagnan and his friends are supposed to still be at the siege of La Rochelle.<PARAGRAPH>Constance thrusts a note at Milady. She recognizes the handwriting as Madame de Chevreuse's, and scans the note quickly. It tells Constance, effectively, that D'Artagnan will soon be arriving.<PARAGRAPH>At that moment, hoof beats are heard. Constance flies to the window in hope, and Milady is petrified. Luckily for Milady, it is not D'Artagnan--it's the Comte de Rochefort. <PARAGRAPH>Milady is thrilled.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210127112556/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/three-musketeers/summary/chapter-sixty-one-the-carmelite-convent-at-bthune"}
