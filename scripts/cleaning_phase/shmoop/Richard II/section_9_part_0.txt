{"name": "Act 3, Scene 2", "summary": "Meanwhile, Richard and his crew have arrived at Harlech Castle, on the coast of Wales.<PARAGRAPH>Richard is grateful to be back on British soil. So grateful, in fact, that he bends down, picks up some dirt, and starts to sweet-talk the soil: \"Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand.\"<PARAGRAPH>Then Richard asks the earth not to help the rebels - in fact, he hopes the earth will poison them with toads, spiders, and adders or make them march through \"stinging nettles.\" <PARAGRAPH>Carlisle reassures Richard that everything will be okay. Aumerle is less optimistic. He says Bolingbroke is growing stronger by the minute.<PARAGRAPH>Richard tells Aumerle that he's wrong and should pipe down. Richard says God gave him a right to rule England, so God will protect him.<PARAGRAPH>Salisbury comes in with some bad news: the group of Welsh soldiers that were supposed to meet Richard at Harlech Castle decided to leave and go home. Apparently they heard a rumor that Richard was dead. If Richard had arrived one day sooner, he would have had an army to back him up.<PARAGRAPH>Richard is shocked at the news, but not for long. He declares he is a king, gosh darn it, and a king's name is the same as forty thousand names! <PARAGRAPH>Scrope comes in to deliver more bad news. Richard says he's prepared to hear the worst. Scrope tells him the entire kingdom  has turned against him.<PARAGRAPH>Richard wants to know where his allies are so he can chop off their heads for letting this happen.<PARAGRAPH>Scrope tells him it's too late: they've already been beheaded by Henry Bolingbroke.<PARAGRAPH>Richard decides to give up. He gives a big speech about death and then sits down in the dirt and says it's time to \"tell sad stories of the death of kings.\" <PARAGRAPH>The Bishop of Carlisle tells Richard wise men don't whine. He needs to get his butt off the ground and fight!<PARAGRAPH>Richard seems like he's ready to take action, but then he hears that York has also joined Team Henry Bolingbroke.<PARAGRAPH>Hopeless, Richard decides to run away to Flint Castle, where he'll spend all his time moping around. He tells his advisors his mind is made up and forbids them to speak.<PARAGRAPH>Aumerle asks if he can just say one little thing.<PARAGRAPH>Richard says no.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201001200228/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/richard-ii/summary/act-3-scene-2"}
