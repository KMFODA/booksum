{"name": "Volume I, Chapter Two \u2013 The Mail", "summary": "Our friendly narrator sets the scene: it's a Friday night in November. We're on the Dover road.<PARAGRAPH>This should spark some bells for anyone who spent the summer traveling around Europe.<PARAGRAPH>Long, long ago, in the years before the Chunnel was built, people who wanted to travel to France took a boat from Dover to Calais.<PARAGRAPH>Based on this information, we're guessing that we're about to see some traveling going on.  It's just a hunch.<PARAGRAPH>Anyhow, we zoom in on a guy who's supposed to be traveling by mail coach to Dover.<PARAGRAPH>A mail coach is a coach that, well, carries mail. And people. It's drawn by horses.<PARAGRAPH>We say that he's supposed to be in the coach because, at the moment, he's walking in the mud alongside it.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, all of the passengers on the coach are walking beside it. In the mud. And no one's all that happy about it.<PARAGRAPH>The horses, you see, have gotten bogged down in the mud.<PARAGRAPH>Since this is long before the time of cars , the passengers don't have any choice but to hop out and walk.<PARAGRAPH>Besides being muddy, it's cold and foggy and altogether disgusting.<PARAGRAPH>The longer we think about it, the less we understand  why anybody would want to travel to Dover at all.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, the coachman manages to push the horses up to the top of the muddy hill. By the time they climb up it, it's almost 10:00.<PARAGRAPH>All of a sudden, the coachman  hears horses' hooves pounding in the distance.<PARAGRAPH>A rider is following them!<PARAGRAPH>Everyone stops and listens as a horse draws up to the carriage.<PARAGRAPH>The rider of the horse asks for Mr. Jarvis Lorry.<PARAGRAPH>A small man answers. He seems to think that the rider's name is Jerry.<PARAGRAPH>As it turns out, this is because the rider's name is Jerry. We're starting to trust this Mr. Lorry already.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry gives Mr. Lorry a letter.<PARAGRAPH>All of the other passengers eye Jerry suspiciously. Now that Mr. Lorry's got a letter from Jerry, they eye him suspiciously, too.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry assures Joe that there's nothing wrong. He  is from Tellson's Bank in London.<PARAGRAPH>Mentioning the name of Tellson's seems to do the trick. All of a sudden, everyone trusts Mr. Lorry.<PARAGRAPH>He reads the note that Jerry handed to him, and tells Jerry to ride back to London to deliver one message: \"Recalled to Life.\"<PARAGRAPH>Sound interesting? Just wait. It is!<PARAGRAPH>The coach starts off again .<PARAGRAPH>As it travels, Joe remarks to Tom  that the message Mr. Lorry gave to Jerry was rather cryptic.<PARAGRAPH>Tom agrees. They puzzle over it for the rest of the journey.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-1-chapter-2"}
