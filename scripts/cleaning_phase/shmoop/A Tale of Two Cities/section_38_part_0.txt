{"name": "Volume III, Chapter Nine \u2013 The Game Made", "summary": "While Carton and Barsad are talking in the next room, Mr. Lorry sits in silence.<PARAGRAPH>He's staring at Jerry Cruncher. Hard.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, he asks what Jerry does besides working at Tellson's.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry says that his work is \"agricultural\" in nature.<PARAGRAPH>We're guessing that's because  it involves dirt. Oh, and bodies. Lots of dead bodies.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry isn't fooled.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he's angry. If Jerry's been using the respectable name of Tellson's as a front for illegal activities, then Mr. Lorry will terminate his position as soon as they all get back to London.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry takes deep offense to this.<PARAGRAPH>He has an amazing speech about moral relativism that he gives here. It's so good that we suggest you read it yourselves.<PARAGRAPH>Basically, he says that what he does isn't so bad...if only because everyone else does bad things, too.<PARAGRAPH>Carton and Barsad come into the room, and Jerry and Barsad leave.<PARAGRAPH>Left alone with Carton, Mr. Lorry asks what sort of deal Barsad made.<PARAGRAPH>Carton says that he's managed to make sure that someone can get in to see Darnay, just once, if things go very poorly at the trial.<PARAGRAPH>He didn't want to ask for anything more: it's a bit perilous in the prison these days.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry starts to tear up a bit at the thought of the danger ahead.<PARAGRAPH>Carton says that Mr. Lorry is a good man and a true friend.<PARAGRAPH>Abruptly, he asks if Mr. Lorry is heading over to see Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>Carton doesn't want her to know that he's here. Mr. Lorry agrees to keep it a secret.<PARAGRAPH>Staring into the fire, Carton asks Mr. Lorry if he has led a good life.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry says that he's an old bachelor--no one would weep if he died.<PARAGRAPH>Carton scoffs at that. She would weep for him!<PARAGRAPH>As they get up to go, Mr. Lorry says that he's an old man...but Carton is still very young.<PARAGRAPH>Carton smiles sadly. He's young, sure, but he's not made for the age that he lives in.<PARAGRAPH>They each go their separate ways. Mr. Lorry heads to the Manettes' place. Carton goes to a small woodworking shop in Saint Antoine.<PARAGRAPH>He stands outside it, and the wood sawyer comes out to see him.<PARAGRAPH>The wood sawyer seems astonished at the resemblance between Carton and the prisoner.<PARAGRAPH>He also comments on Carton's perfect French.<PARAGRAPH>Next, Carton heads to a chemist. He buys two different drugs.<PARAGRAPH>The pharmacist warns him that combining the two would be fatal.<PARAGRAPH>We're beginning to suspect that Carton has some sort of plan here...<PARAGRAPH>It's already midnight. Carton walks through the streets of Paris all night, thinking of his childhood.<PARAGRAPH>He was orphaned at an early age. He's never felt at home anywhere.<PARAGRAPH>By morning, he's back at Mr. Lorry's door.<PARAGRAPH>Together, they head to the Tribunal.<PARAGRAPH>Today, one of the judges is Jacques Three, the most bloodthirsty of all the Jacques.<PARAGRAPH>There's a huge audience in the court as the judges call Charles Evremonde to the stand.<PARAGRAPH>He's been denounced by three people: M. and Mme. Defarge, and Dr. Manette.<PARAGRAPH>Wait...what? Dr. Manette?<PARAGRAPH>The doctor seems as shocked as the rest of the court.<PARAGRAPH>He cries out that the accusation is a mistake.<PARAGRAPH>The judges, however, rebuke him. Nothing could be dearer to him than the fate of the Republic, right?<PARAGRAPH>He doesn't seem to agree. Then again, they don't seem to care what he thinks.<PARAGRAPH>The court calls Defarge to the stand. They ask him if he was one of the patriots who stormed the Bastille.<PARAGRAPH>The Vengeance, who's sitting in the front row, shrieks that he's a French hero.<PARAGRAPH>Honestly, the woman is beginning to irritate us a little bit.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge, however, agrees. He says that he found a letter hidden in the walls of the Bastille...a letter written by Alexandre Manette during his imprisonment.<PARAGRAPH>The courtroom gasps.<PARAGRAPH>The judges order that the letter be read aloud.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-3-chapter-9"}
