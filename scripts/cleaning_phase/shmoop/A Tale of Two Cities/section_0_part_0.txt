{"name": "Book the First: Recalled to LifeChapter One \u2013 The Period", "summary": "Okay, we know that this is a summary and all, but we just have to quote this opening for you. After all, it's one of the most well-known opening lines in English literature. Here goes:<PARAGRAPH>\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness .\"<PARAGRAPH>The sentence goes on for awhile, but you get the general picture. There are lots of opposites at work in the good ol' eighteenth century.<PARAGRAPH>As our narrator points out, these opposites are also rather...similar.<PARAGRAPH>Confused? Don't be. Your friendly Shmoop team is here to help.<PARAGRAPH>It's 1775.<PARAGRAPH>This chapter, the greatest of all openings, is a sort of guidebook to the time.<PARAGRAPH>If you're a backpacker, you could think of it as the Lonely Planet for the eighteenth century.<PARAGRAPH>We don't really meet any characters .<PARAGRAPH>What we do get, however, is a breakdown of the important places in the novel: France and England.<PARAGRAPH>According to our helpful narrator, things in both countries are going along just as they've always gone.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, everything is so dang normal that folks are pretty convinced that things will stay the same forever.<PARAGRAPH>That's our first hint that things are going wrong. Anytime anyone says that things are going to stay the same, there's a good chance that things are going to change. A lot. Anyone who's seen movies about high school friends going to college and growing apart knows that.<PARAGRAPH>To get back to our story, though: our narrator gives us a bird's-eye view of events in England.<PARAGRAPH>America has just flown the coop. People are pretty upset about that.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>In France, things aren't going so well. The economy is in a bit of a free-fall.<PARAGRAPH>Protestants are being persecuted .<PARAGRAPH>In case you're thinking that England is a much, much nicer place to be, though, we should warn you: Catholics didn't fare so well in England, either.<PARAGRAPH>Our narrator predicts that trees growing in the fields of France will soon be cut and shaped into scaffolds and guillotines. Lovely.<PARAGRAPH>Back in England, lots of crimes occur on a regular basis. Just about everyone gets brutally punished, regardless of whether their crime was severe or trifling.<PARAGRAPH>In other words, things may be going along just as always--but that sure doesn't mean that they're going along smoothly.<PARAGRAPH>That about sums up the  state of affairs.<PARAGRAPH>Our narrator offers up a foreboding reference to the Woodsman  and the Farmer  who will be reaping and sowing their harvest very, very soon.<PARAGRAPH>Yup. Things are about to get ugly.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-1-chapter-1"}
