{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Twenty-Four \u2013 Drawn to the Lodestone Rock", "summary": "It's August, 1792.<PARAGRAPH>Monseigneur, that amazing man  who stands in for all French aristocrats, has decided that France is not the safest place to be hanging out.<PARAGRAPH>He's now fleeing across the ocean, headed for countries that are a bit more friendly than his own.<PARAGRAPH>But we're not concerned with Monseigneur right now. We're back in London.<PARAGRAPH>At Tellson's, to be specific.<PARAGRAPH>Tellson's, in case you were wondering, is as dark and dingy and cramped as it ever was. That's just the way that Mr. Lorry likes it.<PARAGRAPH>At the moment, Darnay is trying to talk Mr. Lorry out of going to France on business.<PARAGRAPH>It's too dangerous in France at the moment--especially for an elderly man.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry agrees, but business is business. Tellson's has many French customers, and someone has to look after their property, even during times of strife.<PARAGRAPH>As it turns out, Mr. Lorry happens to be one of the youngest members of Tellson's.<PARAGRAPH>If anyone could brave war and revolution, it'd be him. That's what he thinks, at any rate.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay remains unconvinced.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry assures him that he'll bring Jerry Cruncher along as a bodyguard.<PARAGRAPH>Between the two of them, they should be able to stop any mischief that people might intend toward the bank or the bank's property.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay and Mr. Lorry stand in a corner of the bank talking together.<PARAGRAPH>Gradually, another conversation in the bank catches their attention.<PARAGRAPH>Our good old friend, Mr. Stryver, has brought a letter to the bank. It's addressed to a Marquis St. Evremonde, care of Tellson's Bank.<PARAGRAPH>Our narrator quickly informs us that Dr. Manette made Darnay promise never to reveal his real identity.<PARAGRAPH>Perhaps that's why Darnay starts when he sees the letter--but he doesn't say a word.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, Stryver has more than enough words for the entire office.<PARAGRAPH>He explains that the new Marquis is a craven coward. He abandoned his lands before the old Marquis died.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay steps into the conversation and says that he knows the Marquis. He can deliver the letter.<PARAGRAPH>Puzzled, Mr. Lorry hands it to him.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay quickly leaves. As he walks out, he opens the letter.<PARAGRAPH>It's from Monsieur Gabelle, the steward of his uncle's lands.<PARAGRAPH>Gabelle has been taken prisoner merely because he did what the Marquis ordered him to do.<PARAGRAPH>Now he begs the new Marquis  to come back and take responsibility for his own lands.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay puts down the letter and begins some serious thinking.<PARAGRAPH>Sure, he once believed that it would be better for him to abandon his inheritance entirely.<PARAGRAPH>Starting life over in England was a bit hard, but at least he wasn't the cause of other people's pain.<PARAGRAPH>Now, however, he sees that inaction can be as morally corrupt as bad actions.<PARAGRAPH>Quickly, Darnay comes to a conclusion: he must return to France.<PARAGRAPH>With this decided, Darnay sets about planning a \"business\" trip. He tells Lucie that he'll be gone for a few days.<PARAGRAPH>Then he writes a letter explaining his real situation and leaves it for her to find once he's left.<PARAGRAPH>He also writes to the doctor, asking him to take care of the family until he returns.<PARAGRAPH>In the dead of the night, Darnay sets out for Paris.<PARAGRAPH>We're not sure, but  we really don't have a very good feeling about this...", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-24"}
