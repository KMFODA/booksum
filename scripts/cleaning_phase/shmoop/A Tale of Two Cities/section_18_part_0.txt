Any charm he does have, however, he never displays when he goes to visit the Manettes.<PARAGRAPH>Today, for some reason, his feet seem to find their way to the Manettes' house of their own accord.<PARAGRAPH>He finds Lucie there alone.<PARAGRAPH>When she sees him, she immediately notices that he's even less well than he usually is.<PARAGRAPH>That's not saying much.<PARAGRAPH>She asks Carton what's wrong.<PARAGRAPH>He responds that his life is miserable and hopeless.<PARAGRAPH>She asks why he can't change.<PARAGRAPH>We know, we know--it's a useless question. Someone had to ask it, though.<PARAGRAPH>Carton doesn't answer directly. Instead, he begins one of the strangest love scenes in all of Dickens' novels.<PARAGRAPH>We're not even really sure that it's a love scene.<PARAGRAPH>See, Carton knows that Lucie couldn't love a man like him.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, that's exactly what he tells her.<PARAGRAPH>Dismayed, Lucie doesn't know what to say.<PARAGRAPH>Sure, she feels badly for Carton. She even cares about him. But the saddest thing in this whole deal is that he's right--and they both know it.<PARAGRAPH>True to her good-natured self, though, Lucie asks if there's anything that she can do to help him without promising to love him.<PARAGRAPH>Carton says that if anyone could have reformed him, she could have.<PARAGRAPH>It looks like he's past saving, then.<PARAGRAPH>Just like he thought he was.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Carton just dropped by to unburden himself...sort of like  a very, very painful self-help session.<PARAGRAPH>Distraught, Lucie asks again if there's no way that she could be a force for good in his life.<PARAGRAPH>Carton seems to have moved past this, however.<PARAGRAPH>He begs her to keep this conversation confidential; it's the last time he'll ever confide in anyone, and he'd like to remember that it ended well.<PARAGRAPH>Seeing that Lucie seems upset, he entreats her not to be troubled by his sorrows.<PARAGRAPH>More than anything, he wants her to be happy.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he's so committed to her happiness that he begs her to remember  that he would give his own life to keep those that she loves safe.<PARAGRAPH>Bidding Lucie farewell, Carton rushes out the door.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-13"}
