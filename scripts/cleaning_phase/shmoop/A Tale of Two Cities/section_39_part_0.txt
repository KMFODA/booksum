{"name": "Volume III, Chapter Ten \u2013 The Substance of the Shadow", "summary": "It's 1767. Dr. Manette writes in his prison cell.<PARAGRAPH>He's decided to recount the reason that he's been unjustly imprisoned for so long.<PARAGRAPH>To do so, he starts his history ten years earlier, in 1757.<PARAGRAPH>It's late at night. The doctor is out walking near his residence by the medical college.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, a carriage races by. The driver calls Dr. Manette's name and the carriage screeches to a halt.<PARAGRAPH>Inside the carriage, two men sit in the dark.<PARAGRAPH>We're sensing that this will lead to no good.  No good at all.<PARAGRAPH>The men ask if he's Dr. Manette. He says that he is.<PARAGRAPH>They inform him that he needs to come with them to see to some patients.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Manette has misgivings, but he gets in the carriage.<PARAGRAPH>Soon the carriage arrives at a country house. As they go in the gate, one of the men strikes the gate-keeper with his glove.<PARAGRAPH>That's a big hint: he's not a very nice guy.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Manette notices the same thing.<PARAGRAPH>Inside the house, he finds a patient who appears to be suffering from brain fever.<PARAGRAPH>She's a beautiful young woman who seems to be about twenty years old.<PARAGRAPH>Her hands are bound to the bed.<PARAGRAPH>Oh, and she appears to be delirious.<PARAGRAPH>As the doctor approaches her, she moans, \"My husband, my father, and my brother!\" and then counts to twelve and whispers, \"Hush!\"<PARAGRAPH>Puzzled, Dr. Manette listens as she repeats the same phrases over and over.<PARAGRAPH>When he asks the brothers how long this has lasted, they say she's been screaming since last night.<PARAGRAPH>They bring out a case of medicines for the doctor to use.<PARAGRAPH>After taking one look at the medicines, the doctor realizes that they're all narcotics and poisons.<PARAGRAPH>The younger brother  asks if he doubts their worth.<PARAGRAPH>Calmly, Dr. Manette gives the young woman a small amount of a narcotic.<PARAGRAPH>She continues to scream for her husband, father, and brother. Eventually she starts shaking so violently that he has to restrain her.<PARAGRAPH>After a few hours, the elder brother says that there's actually another patient in the house as well.<PARAGRAPH>Surprised, the doctor follows the brothers out into the barn.<PARAGRAPH>A young man lies in the hay. He's been stabbed.<PARAGRAPH>Hmm...and no one thought that the doctor should see him until now?<PARAGRAPH>Astonished, Dr. Manette asks to see the wound.<PARAGRAPH>The young man refuses. He's dying. He doesn't want to be treated.<PARAGRAPH>As Dr. Manette looks at the man, he realizes that he's been stabbed with a sword.<PARAGRAPH>Only nobles carry swords.<PARAGRAPH>The boy says that he may be poor, but he has pride.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly they can all hear the young girl screaming again. The boy asks if Dr. Manette has seen her.<PARAGRAPH>He tells the doctor that the girl is his sister. She married a young man she loved.<PARAGRAPH>The nobles  wanted the girl. They harnessed her husband to a dog cart and drove him all day, but he wouldn't give his wife to them.<PARAGRAPH>Needless to say, they killed him.<PARAGRAPH>The young nobleman rode away with the young boy's sister. When he ran in to tell his father, the old man's heart broke. He died.<PARAGRAPH>Desperate to save his family, the young boy took his other  sister away from the country where they lived.<PARAGRAPH>He returned to seek revenge for the rape and kidnapping of his sister.<PARAGRAPH>The nobleman met him and tried to whip him, but the young boy forced him to fight. The noble struck the boy through with his sword.<PARAGRAPH>Even though the young boy is clearly dying now, he asks Dr. Manette to raise him so that he can look at the two noble brothers who've wrecked his family.<PARAGRAPH>The younger brother has run away. The elder, however, stands watching.<PARAGRAPH>Gasping for breath, the young boy curses the nobles and all of their family. Then he dies.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Manette returns to the young woman. After sitting with her for days, he slowly realizes that she's pregnant.<PARAGRAPH>At that point, he realizes that she's given up any desire to live at all.<PARAGRAPH>When the Marquis asks Dr. Manette how his patient is doing, he says that she's almost dead.<PARAGRAPH>The Marquis says something slighting about the amazing strength of the poor.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Manette replies that there's often great strength in despair.<PARAGRAPH>That's when the nobles realize that they can't trust Manette.<PARAGRAPH>Once the girl dies, the Marquis offers Dr. Manette gold. He turns it down.<PARAGRAPH>Back at home, Dr. Manette gets a letter saying that a lady is waiting to meet him.<PARAGRAPH>It's the wife of the Marquis. Somehow, she's learned about the fate of the young woman and her family.<PARAGRAPH>She's devastated at the ruin caused by her husband. She wants her son to have a different life than his father.<PARAGRAPH>Asking for a way to help the family, the woman begs Dr. Manette to tell her where the other sister of the family was taken.<PARAGRAPH>He doesn't know. The woman rides away. She's decided to leave her husband and take her child with her.<PARAGRAPH>Troubled by all of this, Dr. Manette writes a letter to the Minister of State explaining the situation.<PARAGRAPH>That night, Dr. Manette's servant, Ernest Defarge, comes into the house to say that a man is standing at the gate.<PARAGRAPH>Shocked, Dr. Manette realizes that the man isn't at the gate. He's right behind Ernest!<PARAGRAPH>The man, of course, is from the Marquis.<PARAGRAPH>He takes Dr. Manette to an \"urgent\" medical case. On the road, the carriage stops.<PARAGRAPH>Two brothers emerge from the shadows and identify Dr. Manette. The elder holds Dr. Manette's letter.<PARAGRAPH>He burns the letter in front of Dr. Manette's eyes, and then the carriage drives to the prison.<PARAGRAPH>Since then, he's been locked in a living grave.<PARAGRAPH>When the court finishes reading Dr. Manette's letter, they immediately vote to hang Charles Evremonde. The crowd roars in approval.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-iii-chapter-ten-the-substance-of-the-shadow"}
