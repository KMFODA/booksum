{"name": "Volume I, Chapter Five \u2013 The Wine-Shop", "summary": "We flash to Paris: in front of a wine-shop, a great big ol' barrel of wine has fallen and broken open.<PARAGRAPH>It's like the entire street  won the lottery.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone dives into the road, heedless of the dirt or of traffic.<PARAGRAPH>They soak up wine with buckets and glasses and their hands and their shirts.<PARAGRAPH>Everything quickly becomes bright red.<PARAGRAPH>Foreshadowing, anyone? Well, yes. Yes, it is. As our narrator intones, this red will all too soon be replaced by the red of blood flowing in the streets.<PARAGRAPH>In Saint Antoine, the district where the store is, everyone's hands will soon become stained with blood, too.<PARAGRAPH>How's that for a nifty prediction?<PARAGRAPH>Once the wine is all sopped up, however, the absolute poverty of the place is recognizable again.<PARAGRAPH>People are hungry; shops are barely open; children are thin and undernourished.<PARAGRAPH>The owner of the wine-shop, surveying the street, shrugs his shoulders.<PARAGRAPH>After all, he didn't spill the wine. It's the merchant who'll have to bear the loss of the casket.<PARAGRAPH>Our narrator takes a second to look closely at Defarge.<PARAGRAPH>Since he does, we will, too. Defarge is a bull-necked, barrel-chested sort of guy.  He's not exactly the type you'd like to meet in a dark alley.<PARAGRAPH>Come to think of it, he's not the sort of guy that you'd want to oppose at all.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge walks into his store, where his wife sits knitting.<PARAGRAPH>She's strong and as steadfast as he seems to be.  She sure doesn't stop knitting, for one thing.<PARAGRAPH>She coughs and rolls her eyes.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge seems to know what she means. Apparently they have a secret language worked out.<PARAGRAPH>He turns and looks at the old man and young woman who have seated themselves in the corner.<PARAGRAPH>Any guesses as to who they are?<PARAGRAPH>Defarge pretends not to notice them.<PARAGRAPH>He starts up a conversation with other customers. Strangely enough, all of their names seem to be Jacques.<PARAGRAPH>Either everyone's mothers got together and decided to make the city identical, or  something fishy is going on...<PARAGRAPH>After some conversation with the Jacqueses, Defarge tells them that the room they all wanted to see is out back.<PARAGRAPH>The three men all troop out to the back of the shop.<PARAGRAPH>Turning to the old man , Defarge offers to lead them up to the doctor's room.<PARAGRAPH>On the way, Mr. Lorry asks if the doctor has changed much.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge answers in one word, \"Changed!\"<PARAGRAPH>Apparently he's not really a man of words. He does hit the walls pretty expressively, though.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry seems to get his meaning. He gets more and more worried as they ascend the staircase in the back of the shop.<PARAGRAPH>They go up flights and flights of stairs. It's dark and dingy and rather awful.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry asks why Defarge has to keep the doctor under lock and key. It seems rather cruel after his imprisonment.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge explains that the doctor has become so accustomed to the sound of a key turning in a lock that he can no longer exist without knowing that he's under lock and key.<PARAGRAPH>Convinced that the doctor might harm himself if he's not kept guarded, Defarge has locked him into his room.<PARAGRAPH>As they reach the top of the stairs, they run into Jacques one, two, and three.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently the \"room\" that they were planning to see was also the doctor's room.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge pushes them out of the way as Lucie looks on, astounded.<PARAGRAPH>When they enter the room, Mr. Lorry turns to Lucie, his eyes wet.<PARAGRAPH>After all, he reminds her, it's only business.<PARAGRAPH>Lucie, scared to meet the man inside, hesitates at the doorframe.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Lorry sees her fear and helps her through the door.<PARAGRAPH>In the darkness that blankets the room, they can just barely see the figure of a man: he's sitting at a very low bench, making shoes.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-1-chapter-5"}
