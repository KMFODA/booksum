{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Sixteen \u2013 Still Knitting", "summary": "Madame Defarge and her husband return to their shop after the procession.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, the mender of roads makes his way back into the country.<PARAGRAPH>The country folk seem to have changed as a result of the hanging in the village. Their faces are harder; their eyes have become full of vengeance.<PARAGRAPH>Sounds to us like  a storm's a-brewin'.<PARAGRAPH>Okay, but let's head back to Paris for now, shall we?<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge is quizzing her husband about the news that he's just heard from a Jacques who's on the police force.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, the police have hired a new spy to ferret out revolutionaries .<PARAGRAPH>This new spy is English. His name is Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge says that he'll need to be registered in her knitting.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge describes the guy's physical appearance.<PARAGRAPH>Nodding, Madame Defarge takes it all down. She's pretty pleased at her husband's ability to get such good information.<PARAGRAPH>As the two enter the empty wine-shop, Madame Defarge asks her husband why he seems so down and out.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge sighs, then says that change seems to take such a long time. Too long, perhaps.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge stares at him sternly. Then she begins to lecture him.<PARAGRAPH>In case we haven't mentioned it, she's something of  a force of nature.<PARAGRAPH>She manages to slap him back into shape pretty quickly.<PARAGRAPH>Okay, she doesn't actually slap him. But she does point out that he's being feeble and just a bit cowardly.<PARAGRAPH>Sure, revolution takes a long time to prepare. But they'll have helped bring it about--even if they're not alive to see its effects.<PARAGRAPH>The next morning, Madame Defarge sits at her seat.<PARAGRAPH>She's knitting. Of course. Beside her knitting lies a rose.<PARAGRAPH>A man walks into the shop.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge picks up the rose and slides it into her cap.<PARAGRAPH>As if someone's issued a secret sign, the shop falls silent.<PARAGRAPH>People slink out the back exits as the new customer comes up to the counter.<PARAGRAPH>A secret sign? Really? Wonder what it could be....<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge makes polite conversation with the newcomer.<PARAGRAPH>The guy's eyes dart everywhere, but he can't seem to come up with anything out of the ordinary.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge thinks to herself that the man should stay around another minute longer.<PARAGRAPH>That way, she'll be able to knit his entire name, John Barsad, into her register.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge walks in. He glances at his wife, then greets the new customer.<PARAGRAPH>The new man hails him cheerfully as \"Jacques.\"<PARAGRAPH>Defarge looks confused. His name is Ernest, not Jacques. He would thank the visitor to use his name. It's more than enough for him.<PARAGRAPH>The spy  is getting more and more confused.<PARAGRAPH>He tries to draw both the Defarges into conversation about the woes of the people, but they say that they spend all their time running the wine-shop.<PARAGRAPH>There's just no time to pay attention to the populace and its discontents.<PARAGRAPH>The spy does manage to get one good blow in, though. He mentions Dr. Manette.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge immediately jumps a little bit.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge quickly says that they never see nor hear from the doctor.<PARAGRAPH>Smiling, the spy says he knows. In fact, the doctor is in England.<PARAGRAPH>Interestingly, his daughter is about to marry a man whose original name is...well, not Darnay.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he's taken his mother's name. In French, it would be D'Aulnais.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge gasps.<PARAGRAPH>His wife knits ferociously.<PARAGRAPH>When the spy asks if anything is the matter, she says that it would be better for the daughter of Dr. Manette if her husband-to-be never returned to France.<PARAGRAPH>The spy leaves.<PARAGRAPH>Silence descends on the house.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge hesitates, then asks Madame Defarge if it wouldn't be a horrible thing that the son-in-law of Dr. Manette were registered alongside the spy.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, she doesn't think it would be a bad thing at all.<PARAGRAPH>Saddened, Defarge leaves. As he goes upstairs, he thinks about what a \"frightfully\" grand woman his wife is.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-16"}
