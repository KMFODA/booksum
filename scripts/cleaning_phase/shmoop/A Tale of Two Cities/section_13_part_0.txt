{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Eight \u2013 Monseigneur in the Country", "summary": "The Marquis' carriage heads out into the country.<PARAGRAPH>As he drives, our narrator gives us a description of the land. It's parched and almost dead.<PARAGRAPH>All the crops that can be wrung out of the land have been grown and are slowly dying--like the poor people who farm them.<PARAGRAPH>Heading into the village, the carriage pauses.<PARAGRAPH>Our narrator takes this time to explain why the village looks so crummy, as well.<PARAGRAPH>See, the Marquis has been  taxing his villagers within an inch of their lives.<PARAGRAPH>They don't have the money to buy food or care for their children because they're sending all of their money to the Marquis.<PARAGRAPH>In the village, the Marquis pulls aside a man whom he passed on the road.<PARAGRAPH>Understandably, the guy's a bit nervous. The Marquis isn't exactly known for his generosity around here.<PARAGRAPH>The Marquis demands to know what the guy was staring at when the carriage passed him by a few minutes before.<PARAGRAPH>Gulping, the man says that he was staring at another man who was riding below the carriage as a stowaway.<PARAGRAPH>Angry and astonished, the Marquis demands to know more.<PARAGRAPH>The peasant describes the stowaway as a tall, thin, white-faced man.<PARAGRAPH>Gabelle, the town tax collector and postmaster, steps forward to take charge of a hunt for the mysterious man.<PARAGRAPH>The Marquis' carriage heads out of town. They've almost reached the Marquis' country estate when a single woman stops them on the road.<PARAGRAPH>She's poor and desperate. Her husband has just died, their farm yields no money, and now her children are starving.<PARAGRAPH>She's not asking for food, however. She'd just like money to build a small tombstone for her husband.<PARAGRAPH>See, the woman is about to die, as well--and she's very upset at the thought that the townspeople won't be able to bury her beside her husband.<PARAGRAPH>Right now there's nothing to mark his grave. Without a headstone, no one will know where he was buried.<PARAGRAPH>Any guesses as to what the Marquis will do?<PARAGRAPH>Exactly. He rides away without listening to another word.<PARAGRAPH>Just in case you were wondering,  this is exhibit B in the case Dickens is building.<PARAGRAPH>Case? What case?<PARAGRAPH>Well, we'll call it the \"Why the Marquis is a heartless monster\" case, for now.<PARAGRAPH>Hmm...killing a small child and ignoring the pleas of a desperate woman. Sounds like the Marquis is a monster after all.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily for him, he doesn't care.<PARAGRAPH>His carriage pulls up to a magnificent country mansion.<PARAGRAPH>As the Marquis gets out, he asks if Monsieur Charles has arrived yet.<PARAGRAPH>Hang on a second...don't we already know a Charles? What's going on here?", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-8"}
