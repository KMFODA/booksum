At seven, he heads over to the wine-shop.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge, of course, is sitting at the till.<PARAGRAPH>Carton heads over to the bar and asks for some wine.<PARAGRAPH>His French is suddenly really bad.<PARAGRAPH>Wait...didn't he speak almost perfect French a few chapters ago? What's going on here?<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge stares at him curiously and asks if he's English.<PARAGRAPH>He says that he is.<PARAGRAPH>As she pours out the wine, he overhears her muttering to herself that he looks just like Evremonde.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge enters the shop; he apparently thinks the same thing.<PARAGRAPH>He starts when he sees Carton at the counter, then walks over to confer with his wife.<PARAGRAPH>She and Jacques Three are discussing when the revolution will be over.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge notes that the violence will have to stop somewhere. The question, of course, is where.<PARAGRAPH>Madame Defarge has an answer to that: they'll stop when all of the aristocrats are exterminated.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge doesn't quite agree.

He meets Mr. Lorry at his office.<PARAGRAPH>They wait until midnight, but Dr. Manette still doesn't return.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, he walks into the office.<PARAGRAPH>He's a broken man. He asks immediately where his workbench is: he's been looking for it all afternoon.<PARAGRAPH>Dismayed, Mr. Lorry rushes to help him.<PARAGRAPH>Carton agrees that Dr. Manette should be taken to Lucie.
