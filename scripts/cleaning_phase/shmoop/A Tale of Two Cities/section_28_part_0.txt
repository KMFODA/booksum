{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Twenty-Three \u2013 Fire Rises", "summary": "We're back in the French countryside.<PARAGRAPH>It's just about as dismal as when we left it: there's no food, the crops are withered, and the people are in about the same condition as the crops.<PARAGRAPH>Despite this, things seem to have changed somehow.<PARAGRAPH>For years, Monseigneur  has squeezed and starved the poor of the village.<PARAGRAPH>Now, however, the faces of the poor have a new look. It's one that Monseigneur can't quite figure out.<PARAGRAPH>Our old friend, the mender of roads, is out mending roads.<PARAGRAPH>After all, what else would he be doing?<PARAGRAPH>A man walks up to him, greets him as Jacques, and the two sit down to eat together.<PARAGRAPH>The mender of roads asks if it's happening tonight.<PARAGRAPH>What? What's happening?<PARAGRAPH>Just wait...we'll find out soon enough.<PARAGRAPH>The traveler wants to take a nap. He asks the mender of roads to wake him at sunset.<PARAGRAPH>It's now sunset. The mender of roads wakes the traveler.<PARAGRAPH>Hey, we told you it was going to happen.<PARAGRAPH>They shake hands. The traveler asks a cryptic question: is it two leagues away?<PARAGRAPH>The answer is yes.<PARAGRAPH>Later that night, the chateau on the hill begins to burn.<PARAGRAPH>Vast clouds of smoke and flames can be seen from the town.<PARAGRAPH>Monsieur Gabelle, the guy who's in charge of the town, awakens to find a rider at his door.<PARAGRAPH>Frantic, the rider asks Monsieur Gabelle to send village folks up to the chateau.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone in the village looks at each other. Amazingly enough, no one wants to help put out the fire.<PARAGRAPH>The chateau burns.<PARAGRAPH>After the blaze dies down a little bit, folks start to remember that the Marquis wasn't the only aristocrat in town.<PARAGRAPH>Gabelle was the one who collected the Marquis' taxes.<PARAGRAPH>Okay, so he's not really an aristocrat. But he's close enough, isn't he?<PARAGRAPH>That seems to be the general consensus.<PARAGRAPH>People start to beat down Gabelle's door.<PARAGRAPH>He takes the advice of his friends and puts a heavy bolt on the door.<PARAGRAPH>As night descends, we leave Gabelle praying that he won't get strung up on a pike.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-23"}
