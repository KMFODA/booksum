He's a bit confused.<PARAGRAPH>Angry, Soloman wants to know what Miss Pross wants.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Pross, teary-eyed, introduces Soloman to Jerry as her beloved brother.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, our narrator is quick to tell us that Soloman stole Miss Pross' money and then pretended to be dead...but she doesn't know that yet.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, Jerry takes an interest in Soloman.<PARAGRAPH>As he remembers it, however, Soloman wasn't his name back in England.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he thinks that Soloman used to be a spy. He was supposed to have died.<PARAGRAPH>What was the name Soloman used to use?<PARAGRAPH>While Jerry thinks, a new voice breaks into the conversation.<PARAGRAPH>It's Sydney Carton. He informs Jerry that Solomon's old name was Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>Carton reassures Miss Pross that everything is all right. He showed up a day ago; he's been to see Mr. Lorry and he's now trying to be of some help to the Manettes.<PARAGRAPH>Now, though, he's here to see Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently Soloman/Barsad has become a spy in the French prisons.<PARAGRAPH>Carton explains that he'd like to have a conversation with Barsad at Mr. Lorry's.<PARAGRAPH>When Barsad seems inclined to say no, Carton gently tells him that he has information that could make life pretty sticky for Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>That changes Barsad's mind!<PARAGRAPH>Miss Pross, however, is worried. She begs Carton to protect her brother.<PARAGRAPH>Carton promises.<PARAGRAPH>At Mr. Lorry's, Carton introduces Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>Next, he breaks the bad news to Mr. Lorry: Darnay has been arrested again.<PARAGRAPH>Not to worry, though: Carton has a plan.<PARAGRAPH>To make the plan work, though, he needs Barsad's help.<PARAGRAPH>As we may have mentioned, Barsad isn't exactly the helping sort.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he needs quite a bit of convincing.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, however, Carton  has some dirt on Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>Barsad has been spying on the prisoners for the French revolutionaries, but he's also been spying on the French for the English.<PARAGRAPH>No one likes a double-crossing spy.<PARAGRAPH>Moreover, Carton knows that Barsad's friend is passing as a Frenchman--but he's really an Englishman, Roger Cly.<PARAGRAPH>Jerry suddenly pays close attention. He wants to know why Roger Cly never got properly buried.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he asks Barsad.<PARAGRAPH>Barsad can't figure out how Jerry would know this...until Jerry informs them that he tried to dig Roger up. In Roger's place, however, he found an empty coffin.<PARAGRAPH>Barsad knows that Carton's managed to beat him in this particular game.<PARAGRAPH>Now that he gets the point, Barsad wants to know what Carton wants from him.<PARAGRAPH>As it turns out, Carton doesn't want much. Barsad is a keyholder of the prison. He can pass in and out at will, right?<PARAGRAPH>Barsad agrees. He's able to go into the prison whenever he likes.<PARAGRAPH>Carton nods, then asks Barsad to step into the next room so they can have a word together in private.<PARAGRAPH>...and, unfortunately, we don't get to read about that particular conversation.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-3-chapter-8"}
