{"name": "Volume II, Chapter Five \u2013 The Jackal", "summary": "Folks drank a lot in those days.<PARAGRAPH>Unsurprisingly, Mr. Stryver drinks a lot. So does Carton.<PARAGRAPH>Here's the difference, though: when Stryver gets drunk, he becomes worthless.<PARAGRAPH>Come to think of it, Stryver's often worthless.<PARAGRAPH>Carton, on the other hand, can down a few and still be on top of his game.<PARAGRAPH>For reasons that no one can figure out, Carton and Stryver are thick as thieves.  They're BFFs.<PARAGRAPH>Okay, they're not exactly friends: Carton can't stand the fact that Stryver's a big jerk.<PARAGRAPH>Nonetheless, he spends most of his nights solving Stryver's cases for him.<PARAGRAPH>Stryver, in the meanwhile, gets very, very drunk and mumbles to himself.<PARAGRAPH>There's a good reason why Stryver calls Carton \"Memory\": he's the brains behind all of Stryver's operations.<PARAGRAPH>Dickens starts to have some fun with the relationship between Carton and Stryver.<PARAGRAPH>Stryver's sort of like a lion...he's at the top of the food chain. King of the hill.<PARAGRAPH>And if Stryver's a lion, then Carton is...a jackal.<PARAGRAPH>Lions are hunters; jackals are scavengers, scooping up the leftovers after animals like lions bring home the prey.<PARAGRAPH>Hmm...does something seem off here?<PARAGRAPH>For one thing, Stryver's the guy who's getting spoon-fed legal insight from Carton.<PARAGRAPH>For another...well, the first one was all we had, actually.<PARAGRAPH>But you get the picture. The metaphor doesn't quite fit. Could Dickens be using a little bit of irony here?<PARAGRAPH>Stryver gets  pretty happy on his punch and, after a while, he begins to reminisce about his past.<PARAGRAPH>And Carton's past, come to think of it.<PARAGRAPH>They've been together since school.<PARAGRAPH>Back in the old days, Carton used to write Stryver's term papers. Now he's writing Stryver's legal briefs.<PARAGRAPH>Some things never change.<PARAGRAPH>As Stryver pours himself another drink, he wants Carton to drink to the \"pretty witness\" who came to court today.<PARAGRAPH>Carton gulps for a second, and then he mutters some unpleasant things about Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>Okay, they're not that bad. But he does call her a \"golden doll.\"<PARAGRAPH>Stryver's taken aback. He was sure he caught Carton staring at Lucie for most of the day.<PARAGRAPH>Carton insists that Lucie means nothing to him.  Nothing. Seriously.<PARAGRAPH>Falling back into a drunken stupor, Stryver heads to bed.<PARAGRAPH>Left by himself, Carton ponders why his life is so unhappy.<PARAGRAPH>He imagines love and happiness for a brief moment, but then his masochism sets back in.<PARAGRAPH>He could never win Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>Depressed, he settles back in for another drink.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210115212823/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tale-of-two-cities/summary/volume-2-chapter-5"}
