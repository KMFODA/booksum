{"name": "Act 2, Scene 6", "summary": "Again, we're back with our chorus  for the final scene of this act, and they're beginning to sound like a broken record.<PARAGRAPH>The broken record goes like this: Andrea complains that he came back to see Balthazar get his, but all he's seen so far is his best friend brutally slain and his girlfriend straight up dissed.<PARAGRAPH>Revenge simply says, \"Be still\" .
