{"name": "Chapter 50", "summary": "The chapter opens with a description of a dodgy neighborhood on the bank of the Thames that really existed in Dickens day--a muddy maze of streets surrounded by a tidal ditch that was sometimes filled with high water. The houses are all in rough shape, falling into each other, or into the river.<PARAGRAPH>Toby Crackit, Tom Chitling, and Kags  are sitting in an upper room of one of these houses.<PARAGRAPH>Toby asks when Fagin was arrested, and Chitling answers that it happened around 2 p.m. He and Charley were able to hide, but Bolter  was arrested, and Bet got hysterical, so they put her into \"the hospital\" .<PARAGRAPH>Charley, Chitling tells them, will be with them shortly. All of the other hideouts have been found out, and are crawling with cops .<PARAGRAPH>They expect that Bolter will give evidence against Fagin, so that Fagin will be convicted as an accessory to Nancy's murder.<PARAGRAPH>Chitling describes how bloodthirsty the mob was when Fagin was arrested.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, Sikes's dog runs into the room.<PARAGRAPH>Toby hopes that Sikes isn't close behind--he doesn't seem to be.<PARAGRAPH>They wonder where \"he\" could be, and whether \"he\" has \"made away with himself\" .<PARAGRAPH>None of them are willing to call \"him\" by his name.<PARAGRAPH>They figure that Sikes must have left the country, and left the dog behind.<PARAGRAPH>They hear knocking at the door downstairs.<PARAGRAPH>At first they think it's Charley, but Charley doesn't knock like that.<PARAGRAPH>It's Sikes.<PARAGRAPH>They aren't so keen about letting him in, but what can they do? They let him in.<PARAGRAPH>He looks like hell.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes asks if it's true that Fagin was arrested.<PARAGRAPH>It is.<PARAGRAPH>No one really seems to feel inclined to chat with him.<PARAGRAPH>He asks if they'll let him hole up there until the search is over, or whether they plan on selling him to the police.<PARAGRAPH>Toby says he can stay as long as he thinks it's safe.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes asks if the body is buried.<PARAGRAPH>It isn't.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes is horrified.<PARAGRAPH>Another knock at the door--this time it is Charley.<PARAGRAPH>Charley comes in, and is terrified of Sikes. He calls him a \"monster,\" and says that if the police came looking for him, he'd wouldn't hide him.<PARAGRAPH>Charley actually throws himself at Sikes  and catches him so off his guard that he knocks him down.<PARAGRAPH>Charley and Sikes roll on the ground, with Charley shouting for help the whole time.<PARAGRAPH>The other three are stupefied.<PARAGRAPH>There's another loud knocking at the door, and voices call for them to open in the King's name .<PARAGRAPH>Charley calls for them to break down the door.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes throws him in a spare room and locks the door, then asks Toby how secure the place is.<PARAGRAPH>The doors and walls are reinforced with iron.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, a huge crowd is forming outside--someone on horseback yells that he'll give twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes asks for a rope so that he can drop down into the ditch that surrounds the area--the tide is in, so he thinks he'll be able to swim out.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes climbs out onto the roof.<PARAGRAPH>The water's out, so the ditch below is just a bed of mud.<PARAGRAPH>The crowd sees him up on the roof, and everyone calls out and points to him.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes is momentarily afraid, and then ties one end of his rope to the chimneys, and ties a loop on the other end to put under his arms, so that he can lower himself down.<PARAGRAPH>But just as he's pulling the loop over his head, he slips.<PARAGRAPH>He falls the full length of the cord, and hangs himself.<PARAGRAPH>The dog had climbed out on the roof with him, sees him fall, jumps after him, and cracks its head and dies on impact in the mud below.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-50"}
