Farmers are coming in with their vegetables and things, and laborers are going to work.<PARAGRAPH>As they approach the main part of the city, everything is bustling.<PARAGRAPH>They cut across Smithfield , and it's market day, so Smithfield is particularly gross--it's full of farm animals, blood, filth, and general nastiness. And it's really, really noisy, as you can imagine.<PARAGRAPH>They pass west across the city towards Hyde Park  and finally hitch a ride on the back of somebody's cart. They continue west-southwest through London and pass outside of the city on the cart, and then hop off at a pub near a crossroads.<PARAGRAPH>They keep on walking, with only the occasional break for beer.<PARAGRAPH>Finally they take a dinner break, and stay long enough that Oliver falls asleep at the table.<PARAGRAPH>He's woken up by a shove from Sikes, because they're going to catch a ride for the next leg of their trip from a guy with a horse and cart who's going their direction.<PARAGRAPH>It's seven o'clock, and already cold and dark when they're in the cart.<PARAGRAPH>They finally arrive at a dilapidated old house outside the small town of Shepperton, and they go in.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-21"}
