{"name": "Chapter 45", "summary": "The next morning, Fagin gives a secret mission to Noah Claypole .<PARAGRAPH>Before giving him the details, Fagin flatters him on how well he's been doing at robbing little kids. You know the expression, \"easy as taking candy from a baby\"? Yeah, well, that's pretty much Noah's job, and he's awfully good at it.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin tells him that the secret mission will be to follow a woman around, and report back to Fagin about who she sees, and where she goes, and what she says.<PARAGRAPH>Of course Noah wants to know how much he'll get paid, and Fagin offers him a pound for the job.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin explains that it's one of their own gang, but that she's found new friends, and that he must know who they are.<PARAGRAPH>Noah agrees to the mission immediately, and seems pretty jazzed about the idea of following some young woman around--says he was pretty good at that when he was back in school. Lovely.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin tells Noah that he'll point out the young woman in question in a few days.<PARAGRAPH>The next Sunday, Fagin is certain that Nancy will sneak out, because Sikes is planning on being out all night.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin takes Noah to their house, and points her out as she leaves.<PARAGRAPH>Noah gets a good look at her as she passes a candle, and then follows her through the streets.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-45"}
