{"name": "Chapter 39", "summary": "The chapter opens with Sikes grumpily asking what time it is.<PARAGRAPH>He's not in the same room he'd rented before the failed housebreaking attempt of a few months earlier, but it's in the same dodgy part of town.<PARAGRAPH>There's not a lot of furniture, or much in the way of spare clothes in the room--apparently Sikes is pretty strapped for cash.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes himself is lying in bed, wrapped in a big overcoat, and looking like a shadow of his former self. The dog is lying by the bed, occasionally growling at passing noises from the street. Nancy is sitting by the bed, looking thin and pale.<PARAGRAPH>She asks how he's feeling.<PARAGRAPH>He responds with growls and grouchiness, and asks for help getting out of bed.<PARAGRAPH>She helps, but he swears at her and smacks her.<PARAGRAPH>She tears up, and faints.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes isn't used to this--usually Nancy's hysterics are loud and violent, like we've seen before.<PARAGRAPH>So Sikes calls for help.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin looks in, and brings the Dodger and Charley Bates in to help bring Nancy around.<PARAGRAPH>Nancy recovers, staggers to the bed, and lies down.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes asks what Fagin is doing there, since he hasn't seen him for weeks.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin says that they've brought lots of goodies: rabbit pie , special green tea, sugar, bread, butter, and cheese.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes wants to know why they haven't been by before, and have left him sick and weak without coming to help him out.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin says he was out of town for part of the time, and unable to come for reasons he doesn't like to repeat for the rest.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes says he would have died, if it hadn't been for \"the girl.\"<PARAGRAPH>Fagin reminds him that he wouldn't have such a handy girl as Nancy around if it weren't for him, and Nancy agrees.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes eats, and Nancy does too, a little.<PARAGRAPH>When he's finished, Sikes tells Fagin that he needs some money.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin insists that he doesn't have any, but Sikes knows better. He sends Nancy with Fagin to pick up the cash and bring it back.<PARAGRAPH>They arrive at Fagin's house, and Toby Crackit is there. He's just finished winning all of Tom Chitling's money at cribbage.<PARAGRAPH>Toby seems slightly embarrassed at being caught playing with someone as uncool as Tom Chitling .<PARAGRAPH>Toby takes off .<PARAGRAPH>Tom Chitling says that the money he lost to Toby is a small price to pay for the privilege of being seen in his company, because Toby's the coolest.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin says he agrees, and sends Tom, Charley, and the Dodger out to \"work,\" leaving him alone with Nancy.<PARAGRAPH>He takes a key to get the money .<PARAGRAPH>Just then, they hear a voice from the street.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin's too busy hiding his key to notice Nancy's reaction--she tears off her bonnet and shawl, and sticks them under the table.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin says that the visitor won't be more than ten minutes, and goes down to let him in.<PARAGRAPH>Monks comes into the room, and notices Nancy sitting there.<PARAGRAPH>Rather than ask Nancy to leave, Fagin takes Monks to an upstairs room for their talk.<PARAGRAPH>As soon as they're gone, Nancy slips out of her shoes, pulls her skirt up so that it won't rustle, and sneaks upstairs after them.<PARAGRAPH>She listens for fifteen minutes, and slips back into the room  just before Fagin comes back in .<PARAGRAPH>Fagin remarks that she looks pale, but she blows it off, saying that it's just because she's been sitting in a stuffy room too long.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin counts out the money for her, and she hurries out.<PARAGRAPH>She starts to run in a direction away from her home with Sikes, then stops, cries, and heads home.<PARAGRAPH>Sikes doesn't notice anything unusual about her--he barely wakes up enough to ask if she's gotten the money before going back to sleep.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-39"}
