{"name": "Chapter 42", "summary": "The same night Nancy drugs Sikes and goes to see Rose Maylie, a man and woman are walking towards London along the Great North Road.<PARAGRAPH>The man is tall and lanky, and the woman is sturdy, and carrying a huge bag.<PARAGRAPH>The man keeps urging her to hurry up, even though he's not carrying anything himself.<PARAGRAPH>It's our old friends, Noah Claypole and Charlotte, from the Sowerberry's house.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte asks Noah how much further it is, and he tells her it's still plenty far, and to stop resting and hurry up.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte wants to stop at the first inn or public house they can find, but Noah says that that won't do--they'll stop at an out-of-the-way place, and not somewhere on the main road into London, in case they're pursued.<PARAGRAPH>Charlotte says that if she's caught and locked up, he will be, too.<PARAGRAPH>He says that she's the one who took the money.<PARAGRAPH>But she took it for him, she says, and carries it for him because he trusts her.<PARAGRAPH>He doesn't argue with her--really, though, he made her take it, and carry it, so that if they were caught he'd be able to blame it all on her.<PARAGRAPH>They make their way into London, and don't stop until they see a very dirty public house called the \"Three Cripples.\"<PARAGRAPH>They go on in, and the only person is a young Jewish man behind the bar.<PARAGRAPH>Noah asks if they can stay there the night, and Barney  says he'll go and ask.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, Noah asks for some dinner and ale, which they're given in a backroom a few steps down behind the bar.<PARAGRAPH>What Noah doesn't know is that there's a small opening behind the bar so that people can spy on the backroom from the bar.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin comes into the bar, and Barney has him listen in on their conversation.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin likes what he hears: they're discussing the stolen money, of course, and what they plan on doing with it, and how they plan on stealing more.<PARAGRAPH>They say that they'll need to find a good gang to get on the right track, especially since the money they stole is in a large banknote that they don't know how to dispose of.<PARAGRAPH>So without further ado, Fagin walks in on their conversation.<PARAGRAPH>He sits at the table next to theirs, and orders a drink.<PARAGRAPH>He makes chitchat with them for a moment about their arrival in the city from the country, and then repeats some of their conversation back to them.<PARAGRAPH>Noah's alarmed, and ready to blame everything on Charlotte.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin tells him to chill, since he's in the business  himself, and can get them in with a \"friend\" who will put them on the right track.<PARAGRAPH>Noah sends Charlotte upstairs with the bundles, and has another word in private with Fagin.<PARAGRAPH>He asks Fagin if his \"friend\" is at the top of his business--of course, Fagin says yes.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin says that he'd have to \"hand over\"--i.e., give up the money he's already stolen.<PARAGRAPH>Noah's reluctant to do that, but asks what he'd be paid by Fagin's \"friend.\"<PARAGRAPH>Fagin replies that the wages include room and board, tobacco, liquor, and half all he and Charlotte both earn.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, Noah realizes that if he says no, Fagin knows enough to have him arrested and hanged, so he says yes. The wages seem pretty good, anyway.<PARAGRAPH>Noah says that Charlotte will be able to work a lot for them both, so he'd like to do something easy, and not too dangerous.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin suggests stealing purses from old ladies, but that's too dangerous for Noah.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, Fagin suggests stealing from little kids who are sent out on errands.<PARAGRAPH>Noah gives Fagin fake names--Mr. and Mrs. Morris Bolter.<PARAGRAPH>Of course, Charlotte immediately blows their cover by calling him \"Noah\" in front of Fagin.<PARAGRAPH>Fagin doesn't really care, and tells them good night.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419220659/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/oliver-twist/summary/chapter-42"}
