{"name": "Chapter 41", "summary": "The tale does not sit well with Frank, and he erupts at Egbert-as-Charlie. He argues that this story undermines one's confidence in one's fellow man.<PARAGRAPH>Confidence? \"Charlie\" is startled. This isn't about confidence; it's about the folly of lending to friends.<PARAGRAPH>\"Charlie\" reiterates that giving a loan to a friend ends the friendship by making one friend a creditor. Plus, how can you even trust your friend as a lender? He might start off as a friend but then turn on you. Friends to foes is an easy-peasy change.<PARAGRAPH>Frank doesn't buy it. He also accuses \"Charlie\" of just repeating Mark Winsome's philosophy without thinking for himself.<PARAGRAPH>Egbert is riled up by the accusation of not having his own mind, but he stands by his beliefs.<PARAGRAPH>Frank: Forget it, but look, \"Charlie,\" look: China needed a loan for his business; I need a need a loan for life stuffs.<PARAGRAPH>\"Charlie\": You look healthy enough.<PARAGRAPH>Frank: Gah, okay. What if I don't come to you as a friend, but just as a human in need?<PARAGRAPH>\"Charlie\": Go ahead. Here's the thing, though--take off your hat, get on your knees, and beg me.<PARAGRAPH>What is this dude's problem? No really. He's got issues.<PARAGRAPH>\"Charlie\": If you beg me, though, I'll hear your plea not as a friend, but as a stranger.<PARAGRAPH>Harsh.<PARAGRAPH>Frank blows up and tells \"Charlie\" enough is enough. He gives Egbert some money and says to use it to buy wood to burn so that he and Winsome can warm up their cold hearts.<PARAGRAPH>Egbert is startled. He then pulls a get-out-of-jail-guilt-free card and chalks up the outburst to Shakespeare's line: \"All the world's a stage.\"", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210302052229/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/confidence-man/summary/chapter-41"}
