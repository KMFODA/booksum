{"name": "Chapter 17", "summary": "More people have boarded the ship. This crop of new blood is sitting in a room, kind of shy, and very quiet. We see the herb-doctor hawking another concoction. This time it's the Samaritan Pain Dissuader--good for whatever pains you--mind, body, and soul.<PARAGRAPH>The crowd just stares at the herb-doctor. They all seem healthy.<PARAGRAPH>The herb-doctor tries again in an appeal to the women, asking if they have any sick, bedridden friends at home who would appreciate this as a gift.<PARAGRAPH>Cricket cricket.<PARAGRAPH>Undeterred by the crowd's apathy, the herb-doctor continues with another tack: You're fine now, but you may have a sudden, terrible pain by noon.<PARAGRAPH>No response.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, another new passenger boards the ship and enters the room. We're talking chillingly dramatic entrance here, folks. Imagine the tough, quiet, tall, dark outlaw type walking up to a saloon. He's s man of mystery. He's got a limp and a little girl with bright, dark eyes as deep as eternity. They're no nonsense.<PARAGRAPH>The herb-doctor goes to these new passengers and makes the number-one wrong move when talking to kids: he acts like a cheery doofus. He takes the girl's hand , sings at her, and tries to get her to sing with him. She gives him a blank stare. Her dad offers him a look of scorn.<PARAGRAPH>The herb-doctor does the \"Don't I know you from the Kentucky ship?\" thing. The man says no. The herb-doctor suggests his Samaritan Pain Dissuader as a cure for the guy's limp. The man says no. He goes to sit down with difficulty.<PARAGRAPH>Another dude arrives--much less dramatically this time. He's not from the shore like this crowd, but from another part of the boat. He buys a bottle of Samaritan Pain Dissuader.<PARAGRAPH>This seems to signal a go for the others gathered there, and some others buy a few bottles.<PARAGRAPH>From his seat, the father asks the herb-doctor to repeat what he just said to the crowd. Gladly: This stuff will ease pain in ten minutes.<PARAGRAPH>Father: Does it make you drowsy or numb?<PARAGRAPH>Herb-doctor: Nah, you retain your brain game.<PARAGRAPH>Father: Lies. You're a lying liar who lies.<PARAGRAPH>The crowd is silent again. Those who have bought some of the meds already feel sheepish.<PARAGRAPH>The herb-doctor shakes it off and launches into a story about how this concoction will cure mental and emotional pain in addition to physical suffering. He purports to have cured a woman in agony over the death of her husband and child.<PARAGRAPH>The father can't stand it any longer. He blows up at the herb-doctor, calls him a snake, and leaves the room.<PARAGRAPH>The herb-doctor pauses and narrates his internal monologue for the audience: he's hurt, no doubt, but he's not going to lower himself to be as wrathful as that man. Instead, he hopes that the audience will see this behavior and have confidence in him.<PARAGRAPH>The herb-doctor gets only cold stares from the audience.<PARAGRAPH>In a weirdly Shakespearean exit, the herb-doctor responds to a voice only he hears calling him.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210302052229/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/confidence-man/summary/chapter-17"}
