{"name": "Chapter 4", "summary": "In the prison, the baby is upset. We wonder why?  Oh, maybe because the baby is in a PRISON.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger shows up, telling everyone that he's a doctor named Roger Chillingworth.<PARAGRAPH>Ooh. Is it cold in here? Did someone just open a window?<PARAGRAPH>Chillingworth is left alone with Hester, we are shocked--okay, actually not that shocked--to find out that he's her long-lost husband. Cue the dramatic music.<PARAGRAPH>He gives both the baby and Hester medicine to help them sleep and to take away whatever pain they feel.<PARAGRAPH>Uh, Hester? Maybe you should be careful about taking something from your absentee husband who's just shown up to find out that you've been stepping out on him.<PARAGRAPH>Hester thinks so, too.<PARAGRAPH>No, no, Chillingworth says: he plans to keep her alive so she can keep on feeling the shame of the scarlet letter.<PARAGRAPH>Nice guy.<PARAGRAPH>Anyway, he's done wrong, too. Sure,  Hester cheated on him, but Chillingworth should have known better than to imprison a youthful beauty like Hester in a marriage to an elderly, misshapen man.<PARAGRAPH>In any case, he's going to ferret out the identity of her lover. Meanwhile, he wants her to keep his identity a secret.<PARAGRAPH>For some reason, she agrees to this.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211014221130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/scarlet-letter/summary/chapter-4"}
