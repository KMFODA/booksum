{"name": "Chapter 3", "summary": "Standing on this public stage, Hester looks out and notices an American Indian and a white dude  standing on the outskirts of the crowd.<PARAGRAPH>She recognizes the white man by the slight deformity in his shoulders and squeezes her baby again until it cries.<PARAGRAPH>But the man just looks at her and puts a finger to his lips.<PARAGRAPH>Helpfully for us, he questions a nearby citizen of the town about what's going on.<PARAGRAPH>The woman is Hester Prynne. She's married to an Englishman who's been missing for two years.<PARAGRAPH>Wait, but what about the kid?<PARAGRAPH>That's just it. The 3-month-old baby makes it pretty clear that Hester's been up to something she shouldn't have.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger asks who the father is, but nobody knows--Hester's not telling.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, Hester is up on the public stage thinking that she's glad she's encountered the stranger this way, with a crowed of people between her and him.<PARAGRAPH>Everyone wants Hester to reveal the name of  her partner in crime.<PARAGRAPH>Her pastor, Reverend Dimmesdale, is particularly insistent. He wants her to 'fess up, even if the man she names has to step down from a high position of authority to join her on the stage.<PARAGRAPH>This plea is so moving that even Hester's baby lifts its arms out to him, but she keeps her mouth shut.<PARAGRAPH>Then, the townspeople engage in a crazy sort of mass hallucination, where the scarlet letter takes on a life of its own and they begin to see its scarlet glow as coming from the very fires of hell itself.<PARAGRAPH>Who said the Puritans were boring?", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211014221130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/scarlet-letter/summary/chapter-3"}
