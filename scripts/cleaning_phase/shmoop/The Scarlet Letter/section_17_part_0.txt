{"name": "Chapter 17", "summary": "Hester and Dimmesdale's encounter in the woods seems so  out-of-this-world to both of them that they have to ask one another whether they're each still alive.<PARAGRAPH>Dimmesdale at last touches Hester's hand, which reassures both of them.<PARAGRAPH>They make small talk until Dimmesdale asks Hester if she has found peace.<PARAGRAPH>She doesn't answer but looks at the scarlet letter, then asks him if he has found peace.<PARAGRAPH>Nope. In fact, he's miserable.<PARAGRAPH>Well, does he at least find comfort in the good that he does as a minister?<PARAGRAPH>Nope. He feels only misery.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, he's afraid that any good he does is an illusion, since there's so much evil in his heart.<PARAGRAPH>Satan's probably getting a pretty good chuckle out of that.<PARAGRAPH>He's wrong, Hester says: it's clear from his words that he's repented.<PARAGRAPH>But penance and penitence aren't any good; he's a hypocrite.<PARAGRAPH>He's just glad that he can look in the eye of somebody who can see him for who he is.<PARAGRAPH>It would be even better if he could have friend, or even an enemy, who recognizes what he has become.<PARAGRAPH>But he does have a friend--Hester.<PARAGRAPH>And he also has an enemy, who lives with him under his own roof.<PARAGRAPH>As Dimmesdale stands there essentially with his mouth hanging open, Hester realizes that she's really messed things up by keeping Chillingworth's secret.<PARAGRAPH>Guilt isn't going to cure Dimmesdale; it's going to corrupt him.<PARAGRAPH>It's time for the big reveal: Hester confesses, Dimmesdale vows he'll never forgive her; she says that he will, and then  they hug it out. <PARAGRAPH>Anyway, Dimmesdale finally says Chillingworth's heart is way blacker than theirs because he violated the sanctity of the human heart in cold blood. At least he and Hester never did that.<PARAGRAPH>So, is Chillingworth going to reveal their secret now?<PARAGRAPH>Hester doesn't think so. She thinks he'll seek his revenge in another way.<PARAGRAPH>In any case, they both manage to agree that the two men can't keep living together.<PARAGRAPH>Dimmesdale asks Hester to tell him what he should do.<PARAGRAPH>How about leave the settlement? He can be free if he leaves and goes into the wilderness.<PARAGRAPH>Um, anyone else think that sounds like a bad idea?<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, she has another suggestion: head back to Europe, where no one's ever even heard of Chillingworth.<PARAGRAPH>Dimmesdale says he can't run away. He will do what he can as a minister in this village, despite his fallen nature.<PARAGRAPH>Hester continues to urge him to go, to \"exchange this false life\" for a \"true one.\"<PARAGRAPH>No, he says. He's too tired to leave, and he doesn't want to go alone into the world.<PARAGRAPH>Wait, who said anything about alone?", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20211014221130/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/scarlet-letter/summary/chapter-17"}
