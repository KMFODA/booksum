{"name": "Chapter 23", "summary": "He starts walking the rounds at the mills and factories  looking for a job.<PARAGRAPH>He finds a job ad in the paper and applies even though he thinks it's probably some kind of scam.<PARAGRAPH>The man taking names at this place asks Jurgis if he has ever worked in Chicago.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis lies and says he's from Kansas City. He doesn't want to be saddled by his old life.<PARAGRAPH>The job all takes place underground: Jurgis is digging the new Chicago subway system.<PARAGRAPH>By the way, this system has never really taken off and most of Chicago's public transit trains are above ground .<PARAGRAPH>This public transit system is the result of some kind backstage wheeling and dealing between a bunch of different big Chicago companies and none of the work is being done by unionized labor.<PARAGRAPH>Still, Jurgis doesn't care. He's just happy that he's involved with a new tunnel so the work should be steady for the whole winter.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis rents a room in a nearby tenement and starts to settle down.<PARAGRAPH>However, Jurgis also starts up another old habit: he hangs out at the local bars for much of the evening to escape the cold weather.<PARAGRAPH>Building underground tunnels is extremely dangerous work, as Jurgis discovers up close and personal .<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis is walking out of work one night when a loaded railway car zips around the tracks and knocks Jurgis into the concrete wall of the tunnel.<PARAGRAPH>He wakes up in the hospital with a badly broken arm.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis has to leave the hospital after two weeks, but his arm is still weak and he can no longer work. He also has no more pay left.<PARAGRAPH>So, yet once more, Jurgis finds himself out on the streets in the middle of the Chicago winter.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis goes from bar to bar trying to get warm, but he doesn't have enough money to buy drinks or settle in for an evening.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis is desperately cold when he hears the sounds of a church service going on nearby.<PARAGRAPH>He goes in to the meeting to hear an evangelist preaching about sin.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis isn't really interested in religion. He's just looking for shelter from the cold.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis listens to this preacher and starts to feel resentful.<PARAGRAPH>Even though the preacher means well, he is comfortable and warm. He's out of touch with the real suffering that he pretends to address with his religion.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis has a few dimes left, so he finally goes off to his lodging house for a bed to sleep in.<PARAGRAPH>He can't really afford this, but it is so cold that he would freeze to death if he didn't.<PARAGRAPH>The only way Jurgis can make any money at all is by begging.<PARAGRAPH>Since he's fresh out of the hospital and pathetic-looking, Jurgis should make a mint.<PARAGRAPH>He's up against professional beggars, though, who use makeup to make themselves appear worse off than they are.<PARAGRAPH>Some of his fellow beggars are also really, really badly off - much more desperate even than poor Jurgis.<PARAGRAPH>So, Jurgis doesn't really stand out among the crowd.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210123044944/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-jungle/summary/chapter-23"}
