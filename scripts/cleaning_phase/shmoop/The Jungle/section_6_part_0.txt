{"name": "Chapter 7", "summary": "The family works all summer and, in fall, Ona and Jurgis get married.<PARAGRAPH>And of course, after all the cleaning up after the veselija, they find that all of their new acquaintances have left them a hundred dollars in debt .<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis and Ona are crushed - this seems like a terrible beginning to their married life.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis can't stop noticing Ona, whom he thinks is too sensitive and good for this time of life.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis feels that he has failed Ona, and promises himself to work harder to protect her from the awful realities of their lives.<PARAGRAPH>There are so many things that go wrong that they have absolutely no way to plan for: Ona gets caught in the drenching rain on her way to work one day  so she gets sick.<PARAGRAPH>The children of the family keep getting sick. The family has no way of knowing that there is a cesspool under their house because there is no plumbing and no sewer line leading to their home.<PARAGRAPH>Teta Elzbieta doesn't know what kind of medicines to buy in this new place.<PARAGRAPH>And none of them recognize that their food has unknown additives and preservatives that aren't good for them.<PARAGRAPH>They can't find anything of quality to buy - everything is cheap and poorly made.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator cites a  line from Matthew Arnold's poem, \"Modern Sappho\" .<PARAGRAPH>But the narrator points out that the kind of pathetic, ugly troubles that come with poverty don't make it into poetry. Poets don't even have a language to talk about the struggles that face people like Jurgis and Ona.<PARAGRAPH>And then there is Antanas. The cellar where he works is not heated, so his cough is growing worse and worse.<PARAGRAPH>The brining chemicals have also eaten through Antanas's boots, and have given him intense sores on his feet that won't heal.<PARAGRAPH>The men he works with tell him that he has to quit - not only will the sores never heal, but if Antanas keeps walking around barefoot in the saltpeter , his toes will drop off.<PARAGRAPH>Antanas refuses to quit, but his body can't handle the strain.<PARAGRAPH>Antanas collapses one day, and he just can't get up again.<PARAGRAPH>He coughs all day and all night, but he keeps hoping he will be well enough to get back to work the next morning.<PARAGRAPH>But, finally, Antanas dies.<PARAGRAPH>They are too poor to give him a proper funeral according to the old customs, even though Teta Elzbieta protests.<PARAGRAPH>Now winter has come, with its bitter, biting winds. <PARAGRAPH>The packing houses have long lines of poor men waiting outside, desperate for a job in these tough times. They fight and jostle for a place.<PARAGRAPH>And getting around the city in the cold and snow is difficult.<PARAGRAPH>The boy who works on the lard canning machine with Stanislovas comes out of the cold one day screaming in pain.<PARAGRAPH>The men at the factory start rubbing him down quickly to warm him up.<PARAGRAPH>But it only takes two or three rubs to break his ears right off, since they are frostbitten.<PARAGRAPH>This gives Stanislovas a deadly fear of the cold.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, he will only leave for work in the morning if Jurgis will take him through the snow.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis often has to carry him on his shoulders.<PARAGRAPH>And since Stanislovas refuses to go home by himself, he will almost freeze to death waiting for Jurgis.<PARAGRAPH>The killing beds are also unheated. The men who handle knives can't wear gloves, which numbs their hands and makes them more likely to have accidents.<PARAGRAPH>What makes all of this so unpleasant is that there is nowhere to eat.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis has two choices: he can either eat his meals surrounded by the stench of the stockyards, or he can rush to a bar and eat there.<PARAGRAPH>But you can't enter these bars without drinking, which means yet another expense.<PARAGRAPH>The only thing that keeps Jurgis from getting drunk during these meals is thoughts of Ona. For her, he stays sober.<PARAGRAPH>The house only has one small coal-burning stove for heat. The whole family has to huddle around it, including the children after they get home from school.<PARAGRAPH>At night, they have to sleep in all of their clothes to try and keep warm.<PARAGRAPH>The house has no insulation and is poorly built, so there are tons of drafts.<PARAGRAPH>The cold is like a living thing trying to get in at them.<PARAGRAPH>Their constant battle against the cold leaves them weaker day by day.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210123044944/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-jungle/summary/chapter-7"}
