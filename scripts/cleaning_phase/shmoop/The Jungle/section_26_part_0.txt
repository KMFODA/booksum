{"name": "Chapter 27", "summary": "So Jurgis is a tramp once more.<PARAGRAPH>He has lost all of the things that made him  a powerful guy in Packingtown.<PARAGRAPH>He's also used to the finer things in life now, so being a hobo is doubly awful.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis tries to get another factory job, but it's hopeless: there are tons of unemployed men, former union guys and former scabs, and he just can't compete.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis thinks he will starve to death.<PARAGRAPH>The only money he spends is on half-priced bread at the end of the day as the bakers are closing up shop.<PARAGRAPH>The worst thing possible happens to Jurgis: he gets a job, but he is soon fired because the boss tells Jurgis he's not strong enough. Jurgis walks off crying and plotting revenge.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis snatches a cabbage from a grocer and eats half of it raw in an alleyway.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis hears about this new thing opening in Chicago: a \"soup kitchen.\"<PARAGRAPH>So Jurgis goes to get free soup. There is so much demand from the poor of the city that Jurgis is glad to get one serving.<PARAGRAPH>The soup kitchen is close to the district that Jurgis shouldn't be visiting for his own sake.<PARAGRAPH>Still, he's so desperate for food that he starts begging there.<PARAGRAPH>A woman buys him a meal at a restaurant when she hears his hard-luck story.<PARAGRAPH>There is a political meeting nearby being run by Senator Spareshanks, a guy whom Jurgis heard back in his Doyle Republican Association days.<PARAGRAPH>Hearing the Senator speak, Jurgis cannot ignore how far down he has fallen.<PARAGRAPH>Even though Jurgis is honestly trying to listen, he is so exhausted that he keeps falling asleep during the Senator's speech.<PARAGRAPH>One of the people listening to the senator brings in a cop to boot Jurgis out of the meeting.<PARAGRAPH>The cop pulls him out of his seat and kicks him out the door: they think Jurgis is just a bum looking for a place to sleep.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis goes out again to beg.<PARAGRAPH>He approaches a lady on the street. He suddenly realizes that he recognizes her: Alena Jasaityte, who danced at his wedding feast in the first chapter.<PARAGRAPH>Alena tells Jurgis that she isn't carrying her purse so she has no money for him.<PARAGRAPH>Still, Alena can do Jurgis a favor. She directs Jurgis to Marija, who works nearby.<PARAGRAPH>The girl at Marija's door is reluctant to let Jurgis in. She seems suspicious about something.<PARAGRAPH>The girl tells Jurgis that there is no one named Marija at the house.<PARAGRAPH>The girl goes to answer another knock at the door. It's the cops!<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis runs up the stairs, trying to avoid the cops.<PARAGRAPH>A woman gestures towards the back of the house, where there is a rear staircase.<PARAGRAPH>But the cops are waiting there, too!<PARAGRAPH>There is a crowd of men and women upstairs. The men look a bit ashamed, while the women are laughing.<PARAGRAPH>Yes, this is a brothel, and the cops are here to arrest these prostitutes and johns.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis recognizes one of the prostitutes: it is Marija.<PARAGRAPH>Marija is utterly surprised to see Jurgis.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis explains that Alena Jasaityte told him where to find Marija.<PARAGRAPH>Marija goes to put on her clothes before the cops bring all of the prostitutes out of the brothel.<PARAGRAPH>Marija has been at this brothel for almost a year. She has been supporting the  children on her salary.<PARAGRAPH>Stanislovas has died.<PARAGRAPH>He was killed by rats. <PARAGRAPH>Stanislovas was hired to get beer for the workers at an oil factory.<PARAGRAPH>He would drink a little bit out of each can.<PARAGRAPH>One day, Stanislovas drank too much and fell asleep.<PARAGRAPH>He got locked in the factory overnight.<PARAGRAPH>The rats killed and ate most of him before the factory was opened again the next morning. <PARAGRAPH>Everyone else is still alive, though - Elzbieta works now and then, but most of them are relying on Marija for money.<PARAGRAPH>Marija hasn't seen Tamoszius Kusleika for over a year. He lost a finger to gangrene, so he couldn't play the violin any more. Then he disappeared.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis tells Marija that he's been living as a hobo.<PARAGRAPH>Marija says she doesn't blame him for anything that has happened. None of them knew what they were getting into.<PARAGRAPH>Marija thinks Jurgis should just have let Ona keep on as a prostitute. Ona could have supported the whole family at the beginning.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis agrees hesitantly.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis is worried about being caught up in this raid. He's still wanted for skipping bail on his second assault trial.<PARAGRAPH>Marija tries to get one of the cops to let Jurgis go, since he's just a hobo there by accident, but the cop has orders to take everyone.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis gives a false name at the police station.<PARAGRAPH>He sits in his cells and thinks about how awful it is that even the women of his family have fallen into such rotten practices.<PARAGRAPH>And poor Stanislovas, eaten!<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis tries not to think of the old days, nor of his regrets for what has happened to his family.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210123044944/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-jungle/summary/chapter-27"}
