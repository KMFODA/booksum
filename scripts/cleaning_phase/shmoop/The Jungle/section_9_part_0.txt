{"name": "Chapter 10", "summary": "The family has barely managed to scrape by during the winter.<PARAGRAPH>Marija has totally given up getting married, because the family needs her too badly.<PARAGRAPH>She's also just about lost hope that the canning factory is going to reopen, and she has almost run through her savings.<PARAGRAPH>So, none of them know what is going to happen in the future.<PARAGRAPH>They keep getting slammed by unanticipated expenses for both home repair and taxes.<PARAGRAPH>Winter ends, and they think that they are at least free from the horrible cold.<PARAGRAPH>But every season has its own troubles: spring brings heavy rain, summer brings heat and stench from all of the blood of the slaughtered cattle - everything is filthy in Packingtown, no matter what the time of year.<PARAGRAPH>Marija's canning factory starts up again in the late spring, but a month or two later, Marija is suddenly fired.<PARAGRAPH>Marija believes that this is because she is a union member.<PARAGRAPH>What is more, she makes a  fuss over being shortchanged on her pay. Even though all of her friends tell her to drop it, she keeps bothering the management about her money.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, her immediate supervisor tells Marija that she is fired.<PARAGRAPH>This is a really bad time for Marija to lose her job, because Ona is just about to have a baby.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis is saving up money for a doctor .<PARAGRAPH>Marija spends a month looking for work.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, she finds it: a man hires her to trim the meat of diseased cattle so that it can be reprocessed for canning.<PARAGRAPH>Her new boss hires her because he sees how muscular Marija is. He fires the guy who had the job before and then hires Marija for about half the cost.<PARAGRAPH>Marija has really been brought low - she would never have done this kind of hard, stinking work when she first arrived in Chicago.<PARAGRAPH>She also keeps postponing her marriage to Tamoszius, even though they are both eager to get hitched.<PARAGRAPH>Ona is also having work troubles.<PARAGRAPH>Her boss hates Ona, and Ona can't figure out why.<PARAGRAPH>Eventually, Ona hears from the other girls that Ona's boss, Miss Henderson, was once the mistress of one of the superintendents.<PARAGRAPH>They are no longer sleeping together, but he gave Miss Henderson this job at the meatpacking plant to keep her quiet.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Henderson has close ties to a brothel downtown, and a lot of the girls who work for her are also former prostitutes.<PARAGRAPH>The reason Miss Henderson hates Ona is because Ona is a \"decent married girl\" . Miss Henderson resents Ona's purity.<PARAGRAPH>One morning, Ona gives birth to a healthy baby boy. They name him Antanas.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis scarcely gets to see his baby, even though he adores him, because he absolutely has to work.<PARAGRAPH>Ona has to work, too - in fact, she goes back to Brown's factory a week after giving birth.<PARAGRAPH>They leave Baby Antanas in the care of Teta Elzbieta, who feeds him watered down milk from the local grocery store.<PARAGRAPH>The two of them work even harder so that they can give Baby Antanas a better life than either of them have had.<PARAGRAPH>Yet, in going straight back to work after giving birth, Ona has damaged her health: it's unclear what exactly she has , but she basically never recovers from the childbirth.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210123044944/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-jungle/summary/chapter-10"}
