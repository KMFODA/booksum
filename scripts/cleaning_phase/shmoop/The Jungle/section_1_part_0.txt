{"name": "Chapter 2", "summary": "Jurgis feels that work will come easily to him because he's young, strong, and optimistic.<PARAGRAPH>He hears horror stories about what laboring at the stockyards does to you, but he doesn't believe it can happen to him.<PARAGRAPH>Chicago is the first city Jurgis has ever seen: he was raised in a forest in Lithuania. This forest has long been a game preserve for the Lithuanian nobility. Jurgis's family is one of the few peasant families with the right to live in this forest.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis met Ona a year and a half ago, at a horse fair. Even though he's not particularly romantic, he still finds himself falling in love with her at first sight.<PARAGRAPH>So Jurgis goes to meet Ona's father to ask if he can buy her in marriage.<PARAGRAPH>Ona's father refuses: Ona is still a child , and he has plenty of money to support her.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis goes home defeated.<PARAGRAPH>But he keeps thinking about her, so he tries again after the harvest is in.<PARAGRAPH>Apparently, Ona's father has died in the meantime, and his estate is going to his creditors.<PARAGRAPH>Ona's family is in big financial trouble. There are nine of them, counting Ona: her stepmother, Teta Elzbieta, Teta Elzbieta's six children, Teta Elzbieta's brother, Jonas, and Ona herself.<PARAGRAPH>Ona is a well-educated girl , but she has literally no experience of the world.<PARAGRAPH>Jonas suggests that they all go to America to get rich, and Jurgis agrees. Jurgis's father also decides to join them.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis spends a year working as a contract laborer in Russia to earn the money they need for travel expenses.<PARAGRAPH>At the last minute, Ona's cousin, Marija Berczynskas, joins them. She is escaping an abusive work situation, and needs to get out of Lithuania.<PARAGRAPH>So there are twelve people setting off for the States in this party: Jurgis, Ona, Marija, Jonas, Teta Elzbieta, Antanas , and Teta Elzbieta's six children.<PARAGRAPH>Jonas has heard that the place to get rich is the Chicago stockyards, so they all go to Chicago.<PARAGRAPH>They arrive there after being cheated by officials twice, once in trying to get out of Lithuania, and once in New York when they arrive.<PARAGRAPH>When they finally get to Chicago, they don't know where to go.<PARAGRAPH>They wander around the city, utterly lost and unable to ask for directions.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, a policeman sees them wandering aimlessly, picks them up, and finds an interpreter.<PARAGRAPH>So they learn a new word: stockyards. They start going to their new home.<PARAGRAPH>As they reach the Chicago meatpacking district, they notice that the air is changing: not only is it filled with smoke and strange noises, but it also has a weird, unknown odor. They have no idea what this odor might be.<PARAGRAPH>Jonas suddenly starts pointing and shouting: he sees a sign, \"J. Szedvilas. Delicatessen\" .<PARAGRAPH>This same Jokubas Szedvilas was Jonas's friend who had come to America and gotten rich.<PARAGRAPH>Jokubas Szedvilas is really excited to see people from his old part of Lithuania, and agrees to help them get situated.<PARAGRAPH>Jokubas Szedvilas sends them to an apartment run by Mrs. Aniele Jukniene, a widow. She rents a four room apartment in a tenement house kept for Eastern European immigrants.<PARAGRAPH>These four room apartments often house thirteen or fourteen people to a room, fifty or sixty people to an apartment.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>Even though Jurgis and his new family have seen a lot of awful places on their travels over to the States, this apartment where they are expected to live is still the worst thing they have ever seen.<PARAGRAPH>The most terrible thing of all is that they are lucky to get space with Mrs. Jukniene, because her apartment is not the worst. She has a separate room for the women and children.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis promises that he and maybe Jonas will get a job, and then they will find their own place.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis and Ona go for a walk through the streets, which are muddy and filled with flies and the smell of rot.<PARAGRAPH>The reason the air is filled with this awful smell is because these streets have been built on landfill: the city digs up all the earth to make bricks and then fills in the holes with garbage, which they then cover over. <PARAGRAPH>Jurgis and Ona are impressed by this inventive use of the land.<PARAGRAPH>Jurgis can still look at this landfill being created for people to live on and think that it's proof of human invention and can-do spirit.<PARAGRAPH>He still believes that America is the land of opportunity.<PARAGRAPH>He promises Ona he will get a job the next day.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210123044944/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-jungle/summary/chapter-2"}
