{"name": "Volume 4, Chapter 14", "summary": "Annette's seen a ghost! She storms into Emily's parlour, shaken from head to toe.<PARAGRAPH>Yep, the ghost is her sweetheart Ludovico, returned from his adventure beyond the haunted room.<PARAGRAPH>Ludovico also bears news that the Count de Villeforte and Blanche are on their way for a visit to La Vallee. Guess they haven't had enough excitement.<PARAGRAPH>It's time for Ludovico to tell his crazy story. Emily's practically salivating.<PARAGRAPH>Back when Ludovico was waiting up all night for the ghost to arrive, he was surprised to see a man's face. He also hears the distinct sound of a key being turned in a lock.<PARAGRAPH>Before Ludovico can say boo, a bunch of men rush out of a secret door in the wall and bind and gag him.<PARAGRAPH>Then they take him through a series of passages in the walls of the chateau, finally leading into a cave by the sea.<PARAGRAPH>From there, his jailers take him on a boat to the same fort the de Villefortes recently stumbled upon.<PARAGRAPH>Yep, the \"ghosts\" in the Marchioness's room are actually the Smugglers. Pick your jaw off the ground.<PARAGRAPH>And it turns out the Smugglers are also pirates by trade, using the Marchioness's room to keep all their stolen goods.<PARAGRAPH>Em has a pretty good question: why would the Smugglers go to the trouble to hide all their stuff in the chateau?<PARAGRAPH>And Ludovico has the answer. People were always going into the Smugglers' cave. But no one is going into a supposedly haunted room.<PARAGRAPH>Anyway, Ludovico happened to hear the ruffians talking about harming the de Villefortes. Ludovico to the rescue!<PARAGRAPH>The little wheels in Em's mind are turning. She wants to give Annette and Ludovico a marriage portion and settle them somewhere in her estate.
