She asks him to sit down.<PARAGRAPH>Tartuffe asks about her health, and tells her that he prayed and prayed for her...but that he didn't think his prayers were enough.<PARAGRAPH>Elmire thanks him for his concern and tells him not to worry. Still, Tartuffe does not stop. She tells him that there's an important matter she'd like to discuss. She's glad there's no one around to annoy them.<PARAGRAPH>Tartuffe is very glad to hear her say this... It seems he's prayed and prayed for the chance to be alone with her.<PARAGRAPH>Elmire asks him to be open with his answers.<PARAGRAPH>He agrees, but before he goes any further he reassures you that all his visits were prompted only by religious feeling and respect.<PARAGRAPH>At this point, he starts trying to put the moves on her...but he's not very smooth.<PARAGRAPH>He takes her hand, but manages to pinch her.<PARAGRAPH>When he puts his hand on her knee - and is caught - he tells Elmire that he was only feeling the fine fabric.<PARAGRAPH>Elmire starts moving away from him, but he continues.

She asks him if the whole Tartuffe-Mariane wedding thing is true.<PARAGRAPH>Tartuffe tells her that he's heard something about that, but that he'd rather be united with someone else.<PARAGRAPH>Elmire takes this to mean that he has no interest in worldly things.<PARAGRAPH>Tartuffe tries to tell her that a man of God can appreciate worldly beauty, and that it's especially easy to see the magnificence of God's creation in her.
