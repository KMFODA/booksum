{"name": "Chapter 2", "summary": "Candide wanders penniless, cold, and hungry to a nearby town called Waldberghoff-tarbk-dikdorff.<PARAGRAPH>Two men ask Candide to dinner. Innocently, he accepts--but it is clear  that the men have ulterior motives.<PARAGRAPH>The men lead Candide in a toast to the King of the Bulgars. Then they bind Candide with irons and conscript him into the King's army.<PARAGRAPH>In the army, Candide is frequently beaten and mistreated.<PARAGRAPH>Candide is confused about why he's there. Not in the philosophical crisis sense of \"why are we here?\" but rather \"why am I getting beaten every day for no good reason?\"<PARAGRAPH>One morning, not realizing he's breaking a rule, Candide goes on a walk by himself. He is quickly captured and asked to choose between running the gauntlet thirty-six times  or being beheaded. Hmmm.<PARAGRAPH>Candide says, \"Neither!\" But the men say that's not one of the options.<PARAGRAPH>So, in lieu of flipping a coin, Candide decides to give this gauntlet business a shot.<PARAGRAPH>About two gauntlets later, Candide realizes that \"six and thirty\" is a lot.<PARAGRAPH>Right as he is about to be beheaded, the Bulgar King appears and instructs the executioners to spare Candide since it is obvious that he is a philosopher and completely clueless.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201024064035/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/candide/summary/chapter-2"}
