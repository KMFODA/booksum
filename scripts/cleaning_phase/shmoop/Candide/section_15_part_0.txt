{"name": "Chapter 16", "summary": "Candide and Cacambo stop for a meal. While they eat, Candide despairs about Cunegonde.<PARAGRAPH>They stop to rest by a meadow and observe the lovely scenic and tranquil environment: birds chirping, water gurgling, naked women running around with monkeys trying to bite their buttocks. This really happens.<PARAGRAPH>Candide does what any normal man would do when faced with butt-biting monkeys: he shoots them. Again, he acts first and asks questions later.<PARAGRAPH>He's feeling pretty good about himself until he sees that the girls are crying.<PARAGRAPH>Cacambo informs him that the monkeys were the girls' lovers.<PARAGRAPH>The men hide to avoid these hysterical women and go to sleep.<PARAGRAPH>When they wake up, they are bound and unable to move.<PARAGRAPH>The people of the girls, the Oreillons, plan to boil and skewer the men for food.<PARAGRAPH>Cacambo explains to their captors in the native tongue that they are not Jesuits, the enemy of the Oreillons, but in fact have just killed a Jesuit and stolen his clothes.<PARAGRAPH>The Oreillons confirm Cacambo's story, release the men, and treat them as honored guests. How fortunate! This is surely the best of all possible worlds.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201024064035/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/candide/summary/chapter-16"}
