{"name": "Book 1, Chapter 7", "summary": "This chapter opens with a doozy of a sentence: \"Eustacia Vye was the raw material of a divinity\" .<PARAGRAPH>Top that, Thomasin.<PARAGRAPH>Eustacia is likened to a Greek goddess, the night, winter, a Sphinx, and a Pagan. She's paralleled to Egdon Heath after dark as well.<PARAGRAPH>We learn that Eustacia is the daughter of a Greek musician and Captain Vye's daughter. Her dad took her mom's last name in order to sound more English.<PARAGRAPH>But now her parents are dead and she lives alone with her grandfather. Eustacia used to live in the bustling harbor town of Budmouth, and feels that Egdon is lame.<PARAGRAPH>Eustacia is prone to moodiness, wandering around the heath , and daydreaming . She has a raging ego, too: \"The only way to look queenly without realms or hearts to queen it over is to look as if you had lost them; and Eustacia did that to a triumph\" .<PARAGRAPH>The profile of Eustacia continues. She's going through a rough adjustment period in her new home and she's basically latched onto Wildeve for want of anyone better in Egdon.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219180101/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/return-of-native/summary/book-1-chapter-7"}
