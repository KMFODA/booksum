{"name": "Book 2, Chapter 4", "summary": "This chapter is just a short letter from Amy to Arthur.<PARAGRAPH>Amy is all mopey and homesick and a little passive aggressive in the letter - much like in real life.<PARAGRAPH>She writes about meeting Mrs. Gowan and goes on and on how super-beautiful Pet is, and how much Amy is not nearly as beautiful, and how she totally could never measure up to the awesomeness that is Pet.<PARAGRAPH>She adds that Gowan kind of sucks, and that Pet seems kind of unhappy, and that they are not that well matched as a couple.  But still, Pet? Really very pretty. Yikes, Amy, put down the whip. We're thinking that horse is already dead.<PARAGRAPH>In other news, Amy can't adjust to their new life and misses everyone from home. She wonders about the Plornishes, and how they are doing now that Dorrit bought them a business and they are able to have Old Nandy come live with them again.  <PARAGRAPH>She also keeps expecting to find the prison around every corner and Mrs. Clennam's house on the next block. On top of that, she's super-sad that she isn't at Dorrit's beck and call anymore.<PARAGRAPH>Finally she hopes Arthur thinks about her sometimes, and that he'll keep remembering her as the poor, raggedy girl he met, not the daughter of some rich obnoxious dude.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419213154/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/little-dorrit/summary/book-2-chapter-4"}
