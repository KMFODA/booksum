So is Miss Rugg, Mr. Rugg's daughter, whose main claim to fame is that she sued a former fiance for breach of contract for breaking off an engagement - and won! That's right, folks - that was the law back then.<PARAGRAPH>Also there is Young John Chivery - the dude who's in love with Little Dorrit.<PARAGRAPH>Turns out, Pancks has been working overtime sending these people out to mysterious destinations all over the greater metropolitan London area. We don't know why.<PARAGRAPH>They all drink a toast to their new assignments, and all is well.<PARAGRAPH>The other thing Pancks likes to do is check up on Cavalletto, who has moved into Bleeding Heart Yard and is now being called Mr. Baptist by the people who live there .<PARAGRAPH>He's a constantly happy guy, despite the fact that he is clearly dirt poor.<PARAGRAPH>It's a good thing he's so good-natured, because the English?
