He keeps going over and over the numbers in his head - and on paper they should both have been very rich by now.<PARAGRAPH>The more he stresses, the more Casby annoys him.<PARAGRAPH>But he is used to his job and has been harassing the Bleeding Heart Yard tenants like before.<PARAGRAPH>One day, though, Casby calls Pancks into a meeting.<PARAGRAPH>He has a bunch of annoying demands: 1) get even more money out of the Bleeding Heart Yard people - squeeze them for all they're worth; 2) tell Flora to stop going to see Arthur in prison; and 3) stop going to see Arthur yourself while we're at it. Man, that's some evil boss!<PARAGRAPH>Pancks kind of says \"oh\" to all of this, but lets it go.<PARAGRAPH>As soon as Casby leaves, Pancks follows him.<PARAGRAPH>They both end up in Bleeding Heart Yard.<PARAGRAPH>Pancks calls Casby out in front of all the people there.<PARAGRAPH>He tells everyone that it's actually Casby and not Pancks who is the greedy one. He has no sympathy for the people and just wants to squeeze them dry.<PARAGRAPH>Pancks then tells them the only reason Casby looks so nice is because he has all that beautiful hair, which makes him look like a Biblical patriarch.<PARAGRAPH>Casby is too dull-witted to be able to respond to this.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly, Pancks knocks Casby's hat off his head, whips out a pair of scissors, and hacks off all of his hair.<PARAGRAPH>Casby stands there, now a laughingstock.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210419213154/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/little-dorrit/summary/book-2-chapter-32"}
