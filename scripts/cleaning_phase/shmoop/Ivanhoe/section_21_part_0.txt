{"name": "Chapter 21", "summary": "We have another passage from Joanna Baillie, this one from Act III, Scene I1 of Orra: A Tragedy .

He has his eyes set on Rebecca.<PARAGRAPH>De Bracy asks whether it's Rebecca or her father's money that Bois-Guilbert finds so attractive.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert likes both, but he has to share Isaac's money with Reginald Front-de-Boeuf. He wants Rebecca all to himself .<PARAGRAPH>Cedric yells at the guards: they are English, he is English, how can they be fighting against each other?<PARAGRAPH>When Cedric sees that they've arrived at Torquilstone Castle, he's shocked to realize that he has fallen into Norman hands.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric offers the guards Athelstane's and his own life if they can save the honor of Rowena.<PARAGRAPH>None of the \"outlaws\" answer him.<PARAGRAPH>At the castle, Rowena and Rebecca are taken into separate rooms.<PARAGRAPH>Isaac and the Saxon servants get taken off to other parts of the castle.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric and Athelstane wind up together.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric starts getting sentimental about the old days of England.<PARAGRAPH>He recalls that it was in this very hall of Torquilstone  that King Harold II met with messengers from his rebel brother, Tosti.<PARAGRAPH>King Harold II was the last King of England before the Normans invaded Britain in 1066.<PARAGRAPH>Just before the Norman invasion, Tosti rebelled against his brother, King Harold, with the help of the Norwegian King Hardrada.<PARAGRAPH>Messengers from Tosti asked what King Harold would give his brother if Tosti surrendered.<PARAGRAPH>King Harold promised to give him the Earldom of Northumberland .<PARAGRAPH>But for Hardrada, King Harold promised \"seven feet of English ground\" , or maybe a bit more, since he is supposed to be very tall.<PARAGRAPH>In other words, King Harold offered Hardrada enough land for an English grave.<PARAGRAPH>When Tosti, Hardrada, and King Harold fought it out, Tosti and Hardrada were both killed, along with their bravest men.<PARAGRAPH>Little did the English know, fresh from their victory over the Norwegians, that the Normans were about to invade from France.<PARAGRAPH>Throughout all of Cedric's ranting about the past, Athelstane keeps wondering if and when they are going to eat.<PARAGRAPH>The longer Cedric spends in Athelstane's company, the more tired he gets of his laziness and obsession with food.<PARAGRAPH>Wearing masks to cover their faces, several Norman servants come in with food for Cedric and Athelstane.<PARAGRAPH>The Saxons hear three horn blasts coming from the gate.<PARAGRAPH>There is bustle in the halls: something is happening!", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200924210424/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-21"}
