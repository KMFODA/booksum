{"name": "Chapter 7", "summary": "The epigraph for Chapter 7 comes from John Dryden's poem \"Palamon and Arcite.\" This poem is based on Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Knight's Tale,\" one of the Canterbury Tales. In these particular lines, we get a description of knights coming together for a tournament.<PARAGRAPH>Here we get a fairly heavy historical background chapter.<PARAGRAPH>England is not in good shape in the late 12th century.<PARAGRAPH>King Richard I  is being held for ransom by Leopold V, Duke of Austria.<PARAGRAPH>In his absence, Richard's younger brother Prince John has allied with Philip II, King of France.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John is trying to keep Richard I out of England for as long as he can.<PARAGRAPH>He wants to build up his support in the kingdom so that he can eventually steal the throne from his brother.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John doesn't bother to keep the peace or hold proper trials.<PARAGRAPH>England is full of people recently returned from the Crusades, who have become used to violence and theft. This lawlessness is a real problem.<PARAGRAPH>But even though things aren't going well in England, the rich and poor alike all enjoy the spectacle of a tournament.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert gets the best tent at the tournament, in honor of his reputation as a great knight.<PARAGRAPH>Next to him are Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Philip de Malvoisin, as well as a bunch of other Norman knights.<PARAGRAPH>Outside this central space are crowds of people gathered to watch the tournament.<PARAGRAPH>There is a special platform with a throne for La Royne de las Beaulte et des Amours, the Queen of Beauty and Love. <PARAGRAPH>Isaac is in the crowd, as is Prior Aymer.<PARAGRAPH>The Knights Templar and Hospitallers are both arranged around Prince John.<PARAGRAPH>Because Richard's crusade was unsuccessful in winning back Jerusalem from Saladin, the Muslim leader, these knights have abandoned him in favor of his younger brother.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John is also at the tournament, looking cheerful.<PARAGRAPH>A yeoman  insults Prince John by referring to William II, an unlucky Norman king who died from an arrow to the chest.<PARAGRAPH>This guy may not seem significant now, but keep an eye out - he returns later.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John spots a lovely woman, richly dressed: it's Isaac's daughter, Rebecca.<PARAGRAPH>He sees that she is Jewish and that her father is one of the Jews with whom he is currently negotiating for money.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John approaches Isaac to compliment Rebecca's beauty.<PARAGRAPH>John insists that the Saxons sitting in the gallery make way for Isaac and Rebecca.<PARAGRAPH>The Saxons, especially Cedric, seem put out to have to share space with two Jews.<PARAGRAPH>It looks like things are going to come to violence between the Saxons and the Normans.<PARAGRAPH>Wamba intervenes by jumping in front of Isaac and showing him a piece of boar meat he had been saving for the tournament.<PARAGRAPH>Seeing this pork product , Isaac jumps back and falls down the stairs.<PARAGRAPH>The Saxons and the Normans both laugh cruelly at him, which lowers the Saxon/Norman tension. <PARAGRAPH>Prince John demands a handful of coins from Isaac, then just steals his whole purse.<PARAGRAPH>Prince John leaves Isaac behind to be mocked by everyone around him.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200924210424/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-7"}
