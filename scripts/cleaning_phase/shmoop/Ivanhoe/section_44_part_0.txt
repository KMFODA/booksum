{"name": "Chapter 44", "summary": "We've reached the last epigraph! This one is by 17th century playwright John Webster, in Act IV, Scene 1 of his play The White Devil. The speaker announces that it's the end of his story.<PARAGRAPH>Beaumanoir pronounces Rebecca innocent of all charges.<PARAGRAPH>Bois-Guilbert's weapons and body belong to Ivanhoe.<PARAGRAPH>Just then King Richard arrives with a band of armed men. He's bummed that he didn't get a shot at Bois-Guilbert.<PARAGRAPH>King Richard commands one of his followers, the Earl of Essex, to arrest Albert de Malvoisin.<PARAGRAPH>Philip, his brother, has already been arrested. They're both going to be executed for high treason against the King.<PARAGRAPH>And Richard also commands Beaumanoir to take his Knights Templar and leave England.<PARAGRAPH>Beaumanoir is outraged at this treatment. He promises to take King Richard's bad behavior straight to the Pope.<PARAGRAPH>The Templars march off slowly.<PARAGRAPH>During all this activity, Isaac approaches Rebecca.<PARAGRAPH>She wants to slip away from the tournament ground without speaking to Ivanhoe.<PARAGRAPH>Isaac thinks they should stop and thank him, but for some reason Rebecca is really reluctant to talk to her hero.<PARAGRAPH>Isaac remembers that he has had business with Prince John. He doesn't want to get into any trouble with King Richard as a result.<PARAGRAPH>So they leave.<PARAGRAPH>The Earl of Essex confirms to Ivanhoe that the rebels are dispersing.<PARAGRAPH>It's none other than Prince John who brought King Richard the news.<PARAGRAPH>Rather than calling out Prince John on his rebellion, King Richard just sends his brother to their mother's house.<PARAGRAPH>So the only people who are being executed for this whole thing are Albert and Philip Malvoisin.<PARAGRAPH>De Bracy has escaped to the court of Philip II, King of France.<PARAGRAPH>And Fitzurse has, of course, been exiled .<PARAGRAPH>King Richard's return means the end to all of Cedric's hopes for a Saxon line of kings in England.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric also realizes that Athelstane and Rowena don't want to marry each other.<PARAGRAPH>Athelstane takes revenge on the monks of St. Edmund's by keeping them in his basement and feeding them only bread and water for three days. <PARAGRAPH>The abbot, the leader of the monks, tries to kick Athelstane out of the Christian church as a result.<PARAGRAPH>So Athelstane is too busy with these troubles to think about Rowena.<PARAGRAPH>Cedric is happy to see Ivanhoe so famous.<PARAGRAPH>He is also happy to think of uniting his own family to a woman  who is a descendant of King Alfred the Great.<PARAGRAPH>So finally Cedric gives up on Athelstane as the next King of England and agrees to let Ivanhoe marry Rowena.<PARAGRAPH>King Richard does his best to soften Cedric's opinion of the Normans.<PARAGRAPH>He attends Ivanhoe's wedding, which makes the Saxons like him better.<PARAGRAPH>In fact, Cedric lives to see Saxons and Normans marrying each other and generally relaxing.<PARAGRAPH>Still, it's not for another 150 years that they will really begin to speak the mixed language that we now call English in the royal court.<PARAGRAPH>The second day after Rowena's wedding, she receives a visit from a lovely young lady.<PARAGRAPH>It's none other than Rebecca.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca wants Rowena to tell Ivanhoe goodbye for her.<PARAGRAPH>Rowena realizes that Rebecca is the Jewish woman Ivanhoe defended against the Templars.<PARAGRAPH>She asks why Rebecca has to leave. She could stay under the protection of King Richard I.<PARAGRAPH>But Rebecca no longer feels comfortable among the English. She plans to go to Spain with her father, where they have family.<PARAGRAPH>Rowena is wearing a veil.<PARAGRAPH>The last favor Rebecca asks is that Rowena remove her veil. Rebecca wants to see her face.<PARAGRAPH>Rowena's beauty and her kind expression impress Rebecca. She seems content  with leaving her beloved Ivanhoe with Rowena.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca hands Rowena a small case filled with jewels.<PARAGRAPH>Rowena tries to refuse such a generous gift, but Rebecca insists: her family has lots of money, and Ivanhoe risked a lot to save Rebecca's honor and life.<PARAGRAPH>Rowena asks Rebecca what she'll do.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca is going to dedicate herself to healing and medicine.<PARAGRAPH>Still, she looks tearful.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca gives Rowena her blessing and slips away.<PARAGRAPH>Rowena tells Ivanhoe about this strange visit.<PARAGRAPH>Ivanhoe truly loves Rowena, and they live happily ever after, but he does think of Rebecca often.<PARAGRAPH>Ivanhoe does well in King Richard's service.<PARAGRAPH>The only thing that stops his rise to fame and greatness is King Richard's premature death, in 1199.<PARAGRAPH>Scott ends with another quotation, this one from poet and critic Samuel Johnson.<PARAGRAPH>Johnson's lines are about King Charles of Sweden, but he reworks them for King Richard I.<PARAGRAPH>The lines remind us that Richard's fame continues to echo through the ages.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200924210424/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-44"}
