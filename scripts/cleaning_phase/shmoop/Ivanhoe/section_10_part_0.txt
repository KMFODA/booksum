The title character, a Jewish merchant named Barabas, has been forced by the Governor of Malta to give up his property. Barabas swears to destroy these Christian thieves.<PARAGRAPH>The Disinherited Knight has only one servant, a man who also seems to be in disguise.<PARAGRAPH>As soon as the Disinherited Knight finishes his meal, his servant announces the arrival of five men with armored horses at his tent.<PARAGRAPH>These are the squires  of the five Norman knights he defeated that day.<PARAGRAPH>According to the rules of honor, each person who lost to the Disinherited Knight at the tournament owes the Knight the armor and horse that he used in the fight.<PARAGRAPH>The Disinherited Knight can either choose to keep these trophies or sell them back to his opponents.<PARAGRAPH>Each squire has 100 coins to offer in ransom for his master's armor and horse.<PARAGRAPH>The Disinherited Knight accepts the 100 coins ransom from the squires of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, Philip de Malvoisin, Hugh de Grantmesnil, and Ralph de Vipont.<PARAGRAPH>These four knights get to keep their honor and their armor.<PARAGRAPH>But for Brian de Bois-Guilbert, the Disinherited Knight refuses to accept either ransom or armor.<PARAGRAPH>The Disinherited Knight tells Bois-Guilbert's squire that their fight is not over yet, not until they have fought it out with swords in mortal combat.<PARAGRAPH>The squires leave and the Disinherited Knight turns to his servant.<PARAGRAPH>It's Gurth, the pig-herder!<PARAGRAPH>Gurth is trying his best to imitate a Norman squire-at-arms, hence the disguise.<PARAGRAPH>The Disinherited Knight sends Gurth with the money to repay Isaac of York for the loan of his armor and horse.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, in a Jewish home not far from Ashby and the tournament, Isaac and Rebecca are talking.<PARAGRAPH>Isaac is furious because he's had to loan fifty zecchins  to Prince John.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca tries to soothe his temper, but he's still angry.<PARAGRAPH>Isaac is also pretty sure that the Disinherited Knight is not going to repay his debt, since Isaac is a Jew.<PARAGRAPH>Gurth appears after dark on his errand from the Disinherited Knight.<PARAGRAPH>Isaac is thrilled, and he and Gurth start negotiating about how much the Disinherited Knight owes.<PARAGRAPH>Gurth pays up Isaac's asking price, which turns out to be half of the amount the Disinherited Knight originally gave to Gurth.<PARAGRAPH>Isaac is very pleased with the Disinherited Knight for his honesty.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca slips out of the room during Gurth and Isaac's conversation, but she catches up with Gurth as he leaves.<PARAGRAPH>Rebecca hands Gurth a bag of coins to take to his master.<PARAGRAPH>She wants to pay for his horse and armor out of her own pocket.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200924210424/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/ivanhoe/summary/chapter-10"}
