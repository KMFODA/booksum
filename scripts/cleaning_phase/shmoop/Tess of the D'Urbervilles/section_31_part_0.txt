{"name": "Phase IV: \"The Consequence,\" Chapter Thirty-Two", "summary": "Tess still hasn't named the wedding day by the time November rolls around .<PARAGRAPH>It's calving season, and Tess and Angel walk together between the cow hospital, where the calves are born, and the dairy.<PARAGRAPH>Angel points out that, with calving season, there are fewer cows to milk , and so she won't be needed at the dairy anymore.<PARAGRAPH>He suggests that they get married at around Christmas, and she agrees.<PARAGRAPH>When they get back to the house, they tell the Cricks, and they are congratulated appropriately.<PARAGRAPH>Tess still feels anxious, and wants to tell him everything before they're married, since she thinks that a man like Angel wouldn't appreciate being told after the fact.<PARAGRAPH>She writes to her mother asking for advice on this subject, but her mother already said her piece, and doesn't respond.<PARAGRAPH>The date they agree upon is December 31--New Year's Eve.<PARAGRAPH>One Sunday, about three weeks before the wedding, Izz Huett comes home from church and tells Tess that her name hasn't been read out.<PARAGRAPH>Historical Context time:<PARAGRAPH>Back in the day, it was traditional for a proposed wedding to be announced three Sundays in a row at church before the ceremony. That way, if anyone knew of a reason why the couple shouldn't marry, they'd have a chance to get their say in. This tradition was called \"reading the banns,\" or \"publishing the banns.\"<PARAGRAPH>And that's why Izz thought it was important to tell Tess that the banns hadn't been read that Sunday: because now there would only be two Sundays left until the ceremony, instead of the required three.<PARAGRAPH>But Angel says that he didn't want to have a big public ceremony, anyway, and that he'd just applied for a marriage license, instead. It would be more private that way.<PARAGRAPH>Tess is relieved--if anyone knew about her history and saw or heard the banns, they might say something.<PARAGRAPH>The next question is about her wedding clothes--should she wear her best white dress, or should she buy something new? Before she's able to ask Angel, he presents her with a package. He'd ordered a whole new outfit for her, down to gloves and shoes. It's not all that fancy, but it's nicer than anything she's ever had.<PARAGRAPH>She's very grateful, and goes to try it on, but can't seem to shake her sense of dread.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210424232301/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/tess-of-the-durbervilles/summary/chapter-32"}
