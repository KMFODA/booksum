Emil stayed with Amedee until his surgery, to treat his\nappendicitis. The doctors are afraid the surgery has come too late to help him.<PARAGRAPH>The story begins just as Marie hangs up the phone after\ntalking with Alexandra. She feels extra bad for Amedee because she now knows\nthat Emil was with him--it could have easily been Emil who got sick, and not the\nother way around.<PARAGRAPH>As she sits and thinks, she plans to tell Alexandra about\neverything once Emil has left.<PARAGRAPH>She's lonely, so she goes out to walk in the orchard.
