{"name": "Part 5, Chapter 1", "summary": "Part V, titled \"Alexandra,\" begins three months later. The news of Emil's and Marie's deaths has spread \"like a fire\" throughout the whole Divide .<PARAGRAPH>Signa, who has moved back in with Alexandra to help her out\nduring the difficult period, rushes into the barn to speak with Ivar, who sits\nthere mending a harness and reciting the 101st psalm. (Head on over\nto \"Shout Outs.\") A rainstorm is blowing outside.<PARAGRAPH>Frantic, Signa asks Ivar if he knows where Alexandra is. She\nsaw her leaving the house in a thin dress and a sun hat, earlier, but now it's\nstarted to rain and she's afraid she's caught in it.<PARAGRAPH>As Ivar goes about hitching a horse to the wagon, Signa\nspeculates excitedly about Alexandra's whereabouts. She figures she's headed to\nthe graveyard.<PARAGRAPH>Ivar and Signa continue to talk about Alexandra. Signa talks\nabout how hard it's been, having to tell her mistress when to eat and sleep,\nand she wonders why they're all being punished like this. Ivar assures her that\nAlexandra will find peace when she receives a spiritual message from those who\nhave passed on.<PARAGRAPH>Signa asks Ivar why he always goes around barefoot. He tells\nher that the feet are \"free members,\" unrestricted by God's law, and\nwhile he keeps the rest of his body away from temptation, he chooses to indulge\nhis feet . If they get dirty, it's easy to clean them again.<PARAGRAPH>Signa thinks about what Ivar has said, and tells him what a\ngood friend he's been to Alexandra all these years.<PARAGRAPH>Ivar gets in the wagon and heads out into the rain, on his\nway to the graveyard. When he arrives, Alexandra rises up from beside her\nfather's grave.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra hurries to meets him in the wagon, and assures him\nthat she's fine, that she just got caught in the rainstorm. She joins Ivar in\nthe wagon and they ride off.<PARAGRAPH>As they ride, Alexandra explains that she feels better after\nbeing out in the rain and getting wet down the bone. It makes her think of what\nit must be like to be an unborn baby, still in its mother's womb. She wonders\nwhether dead people experience something similar, if they can feel anything at\nall.<PARAGRAPH>Ivar doesn't like that talk, and reminds her that the dead\nare safe in Paradise. He doesn't say it, but Ivar doesn't believe Emil is in paradise.<PARAGRAPH>When they get home, Signa undresses Alexandra and wraps her\nin warm blankets, while Ivar brings her some ginger tea. Alexandra waits\npatiently until they have finished taking care of her, and is glad to be alone\nagain.<PARAGRAPH>As she lies alone in bed, she realizes that she might be\ntire of living. She longs to be free of her body, and longs to be free from\nlonging.<PARAGRAPH>The fantasy returns to her, of being carried away by a\nstrong man's arms. When he returns her to her bed, she awakens. She notices his right\narm is visible, gleaming like bronze. All of sudden, she is aware that he is \"the\nmightiest of lovers\" .<PARAGRAPH>At that moment, the narrator writes, Alexandra knows whom\nshe's been waiting for and where he will take her.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra is in bed with a cold for the next few days. In\nthat time, she resolves to visit Frank Shabata at the state penitentiary in\nLincoln. Frank has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Alexandra figures that\nFrank is the only one who can really be helped. She thinks he's paying the\nbiggest price, even though he is the least to blame of them all.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra sees herself as more to blame than Frank; she took\nevery opportunity to send Emil over to do odd things around the house at the\nShabatas'. She knew Emil liked Marie, but she never thought that he would feel\nany different than she did about Marie.<PARAGRAPH>While she's lying in bed, Alexandra also recalls the day\nwhen she saw Emil and Marie lying together in the grass, Marie with a look of\ncalm and content, Emil with his frown. She still feels an \"aching\ntenderness\" for Marie, and a sense of \"awe\" for both of them .\nShe gets it that they couldn't help but love one another.<PARAGRAPH>She remembers Frank in court, too. She had felt bad for him,\nknowing that he was in a foreign country, with no friends and family, and that his\nlife was now over. She feels he couldn't have acted otherwise, being the kind\nof person that he is. She has an easier time understanding Frank's actions, for\ninstance, than those of Marie.<PARAGRAPH>Before the chapter closes, the narrator steps back in to\ngive us some more backstory. Alexandra wrote a letter to Carl Linstrum after\nEmil's funeral, explaining in factual terms what had happened. She knew that he\nwas likely far away from any post offices, while prospecting in Alaska.<PARAGRAPH>Still, as the weeks go by with no reply, it seems to\nAlexandra that she grows colder and colder toward Carl. Maybe, she thinks, it\nwould be better if she spent the rest of her days alone.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-5-chapter-1"}
