Like Lou, he is also a\npolitical agitator.<PARAGRAPH>It's been raining, and it's too wet to plough the next day.\nFrank heads over to a saloon in another town, while Marie stays home to churn\nbutter.<PARAGRAPH>She hears Emil sharpening his scythe in her orchard. She\ngoes down to meet him, saying she's there to pick cherries.<PARAGRAPH>Marie stops to talk swiftly about the rain and the wild\nroses, giving him instructions not to cut them. Then she runs down to pick\ncherries and Emil goes back to mowing.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator takes to describing the orchard. It's rained a\nlot this season, and the corn is abundant. The orchard has become totally\novergrown with all sorts of weeds and wildflowers and butterflies fluttering\nabout.<PARAGRAPH>Marie, who is sitting beneath the white mulberry tree, asks\nEmil what religion the Swedes practiced before Christianity. When he answers\nthat he's not sure, Marie goes on to tell him that the ancient Bohemians\nworshipped trees, and that some rural folk still do. They believe certain trees\nbring good or bad luck.<PARAGRAPH>Marie says she thinks the linden trees are lucky. Though she's\na good Catholic, she could picture herself worshipping trees.<PARAGRAPH>Emil doesn't think much of what she's saying, but she\ncontinues. She says she likes trees because of how resigned they are to their\nexistence, and because of the knowledge they seem to have.<PARAGRAPH>Emil picks a handful of mulberries and drops them in Marie's\nlap.<PARAGRAPH>They start talking about Carl. Marie wonders whether\nAlexandra has feelings for him. Emil laughs at the idea, saying he doesn't\nthink Alexandra even knows how to love.<PARAGRAPH>Marie disagrees. She says she can tell that Alexandra is in\nlove. She adds that she likes Carl because he appreciates Alexandra more than\nEmil does.<PARAGRAPH>Emil scoffs.

Sometimes, he tells her, he wishes the Divide would just disappear.\nHe's frustrated by his lack of skills and experience.<PARAGRAPH>Marie is hurt by his tone.<PARAGRAPH>Emil tells her in no uncertain terms that he's not a little\nboy anymore, and that she shouldn't mess around with him. He tells her to stop\npretending--and if she doesn't try to understand what he means, he'll make her\nunderstand.<PARAGRAPH>Marie gets up, pale, and tells him that as far as she\nunderstands what he's saying, then their good times are over. But she insists\nthat this will pass and that things will go back to the way they used to be\n. She tells him she wishes he were Catholic,\nsince the church could help him.<PARAGRAPH>Emil says he'll never pray not to have what he wants, even\nif it means he'll be damned for it.<PARAGRAPH>Marie leaves crying, saying their good times are over.<PARAGRAPH>Emil announces that they're definitely over, and that he\ndoesn't expect to have any more of them.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-2-chapter-8"}
