{"name": "Part 3, Chapter 1", "summary": "As the title of Part III, \"Winter Memories,\" tells us, winter has come to the Divide. The narrator describes the barren, cold landscape as \"dead,\" looking an awful lot like it will never come back to life again .<PARAGRAPH>Life has gone back to normal for Alexandra. She gets letters\nfrom Emil. She hasn't seen her other brothers since Carl left. To avoid seeing\nthem, she has started going to a different church, or going with Marie Shabata\nto the Catholic church. She never talks to Marie about the conflict with her\nbrothers, sensing that she won't understand.<PARAGRAPH>All the same, Alexandra still has the chance to spend time\nwith old Mrs. Lee. She sends Ivar to bring her over from Lou and Annie's, and\nthey spent a week together patching and quilting, as Mrs. Lee tells stories\nfrom her childhood, sometimes confusing them with stories she reads in the\nnewspaper.<PARAGRAPH>One day, when Frank goes off to town, Marie calls Alexandra\non the phone and invites her and Mrs. Lee over for coffee. The two of them\narrive at the Shabatas' in the afternoon.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Lee shows off her new apron, which she's just finished\nembroidering. Then she goes and takes her place in a rocking chair at the table,\nwhich is set for three with a white tablecloth and a vase of geraniums. Mrs.\nLee asks how Marie is able to keep them from freezing.<PARAGRAPH>Marie shows them her window-shelves where she keeps her\nflowers indoors, and tells them how she tries to keep the fire going all night\nso they stay warm, or surrounds them with newspapers to insulate them. Then,\nchanging the subject, she asks Alexandra whether she's heard anything from Carl\nrecently.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra replies that he sent her a box of orange flowers\nfrom California, but that she supposes she won't hear from him now until the\nspring. She tells Marie that she has a bunch of Emil's letters to give to her.<PARAGRAPH>Then, after reminiscing a bit about the first time she saw\nMarie, when Emil's kitten got stuck up on the telegraph pole, she asks Marie\nwhen she is planning to send Emil his Christmas present.<PARAGRAPH>Marie gives Alexandra a purple silk necktie that she knit\nfor Emil, and says to tell him that it's for when he goes \"serenading\"\nthe Mexican ladies .<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra doubts that he goes serenading that much, but,\ntossing her head defiantly, Marie says she isn't convinced.<PARAGRAPH>Marie takes a tray of delicate baked goods out of the oven\nand serves them to the two ladies.<PARAGRAPH>As Mrs. Lee eats her pastry and drinks her coffee, Marie and\nAlexandra talk. Marie admits that she had been crying just before the last time\nthey spoke on the phone. Frank had been out late that night, and she was\nlonely.<PARAGRAPH>Later on, Mrs. Lee goes to take a nap, and Marie and\nAlexandra rummage around the house to find the crochet patterns the old lady\nwants to borrow. While Alexandra looks in one closet, she comes across Frank's\nold yellow cane from his flashy, younger days.<PARAGRAPH>Marie admits that he used to walk around with it, and\nAlexandra says he must have looked funny with it.<PARAGRAPH>Marie says it suited him, then. But now, she realizes that\nFrank is out of place and that he married the wrong woman.<PARAGRAPH>According to Marie, she's not the right woman for Frank,\nthat she was spoiled and always wants her way, and that Frank doesn't like when\nshe talks back to him.<PARAGRAPH>Marie's problem, in Frank's eyes, is that her universe doesn't\nrevolve around him. It might have in the beginning, but things have changed,\nshe tells Alexandra.<PARAGRAPH>Alexandra isn't sure much good will come of letting Marie\nkeep on like this, so she goes back to talking about the patterns they're\nlooking for.<PARAGRAPH>When they head back to the kitchen and Marie puts Frank's\ncane away, Alexandra notices that she has tears in her eyes.<PARAGRAPH>It has started to snow, so Alexandra and Mrs. Lee take off.\nNow Marie is alone with the bundle of Emil's letters.<PARAGRAPH>Though his letters are addressed to his sister, Marie can\ntell that they were really intended for herself. The descriptions of Mexico are\ntoo rich, and the content is too personal for a letter a young man would write\nto his sister. They are the kind of letter a guy writes when he wants to impress\na girl.<PARAGRAPH>From now on, whenever she is alone, Marie thinks about Emil's\nadventures in Mexico. She thinks how nice to must be to explore the world. But her\nown life is \"done and over\" at age 23 .<PARAGRAPH>And she thinks about Frank, about how he might still be free\nlike Emil if they hadn't gotten married. She realizes that their marriage isn't\nall that great for him, either. Maybe she's been imagining that he's worse than\nhe really is.<PARAGRAPH>Later that winter, the narrator continues, Alexandra begins\nto think of this visit with Marie as the last good one. Marie seems to withdraw\nmore and more and to be brooding about something that she doesn't want to talk\nabout. At the same time, bad weather also means they get to see less and less\nof one another.<PARAGRAPH>As for Marie, she spends more time with her neighbor, Mrs.\nHiller, who lives alone with her lame son, and continues to go to the Catholic\nchurch in the French country. She tries to let the church fill the emptiness\nshe feels in her heart.<PARAGRAPH>Frank has hired a new farmhand, and they spend many evenings\nplaying cards. Marie finds herself more and more thinking about the wintry\nworld outside, about the snow falling, and the hardened branches of the frozen\ntrees.<PARAGRAPH>And yet, the narrator goes on, somewhere deep down under the\nground, \"the secret of life\" continues, ready to reemerge in spring .", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-3-chapter-1"}
