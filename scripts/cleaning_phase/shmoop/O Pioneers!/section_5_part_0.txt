{"name": "Part 2, Chapter 1", "summary": "Let's move right along to Part 2, shall we? This one's called \"Neighboring Fields.\"<PARAGRAPH>It's been sixteen years since John Bergson died. In the\nmeantime, Mrs. Bergson has also passed away. And neither of them would be able\nto recognize the Divide now.<PARAGRAPH>Instead of the punishing landscape we got to know in Part I,\nthe Divide is flourishing, the fields are brimming with lush rows of wheat and\ncorn, and the population is booming.<PARAGRAPH>The chapter begins on a summery day in June.<PARAGRAPH>A tall, athletic young man, who turns out to be Emil, is\nusing a scythe to cut the grass growing in the Norwegian graveyard.<PARAGRAPH>As he cuts the grass, he whistles a tune to himself. He can\nhardly remember the old days, when his sister struggled to make it while all\nthe others chose to abandon the land. Though he seems happy and carefree,\noccasionally he pauses, with a frown on his face, which seems to indicate that\nsomething is weighing on his mind.<PARAGRAPH>A cart rolls up and a voice calls out to Emil. It's Marie Tovesky,\nnow Marie Shabata, the little girl Emil meets in Chapter 1. She offers to give\nhim a lift, but she sees he hasn't finished up mowing yet.<PARAGRAPH>They strike up a conversation as Emil mows. They talk about\nthe freethinking Bohemians who, despite being from a Catholic country, are\nburied in the Norwegian  graveyard and the upcoming marriage\nof their friend Amedee Chevalier. Marie asks Emil to come mow her orchard, and\nreminds him to dance with the French girls at the wedding, so they don't get\ntheir feelings hurt. It sounds like he spends most of the time dancing with\nMarie.<PARAGRAPH>In the course of the conversation, we find out that Emil is\nstudying at the university, and that Marie is married to a man named Frank. Marie\nmentions that her husband's mad at her for lending their saddle to another man.<PARAGRAPH>Talk about tension. Marie appears openly flirtatious, while\nEmil seems to be ignoring it.<PARAGRAPH>Emil finishes and they ride together toward a large white\nhouse that belongs to Alexandra, now a wealthy farmer.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator clues us in that this is one of the richest\nfarms on the Divide. We also get some details on the house: though stately, the\nhouse is only partially finished, with some rooms with wallpaper and filled\nwith furniture, while others are still bare. The kitchen is the nicest room,\nwhere three Swedish girls work for Alexandra, and where many of the original\nthings from the Bergson homestead remain.<PARAGRAPH>The garden around the house is orderly and productive,\nunlike the unevenly furnished home. As the narrator says, we get the feeling\nthat \"it is in the soil that  expresses herself best\" .", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219131311/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/o-pioneers/summary/part-2-chapter-1"}
