He walks to the boundary between the Bergsons' place and his father's, and waits for the sunrise.

Emil is with Marie. Carl figures they're after some ducks.<PARAGRAPH>There is a rustle of bird, the gun fires, and five ducks\nfall. The two of them laugh and gather up the ducks. Just then, Marie's face\nfalls and she reproaches Emil for killing them.<PARAGRAPH>Emil gets annoyed, and tells her that she's as bad as old\nIvar. He apologizes, though not without a tone of bitterness.<PARAGRAPH>The two head off, having not seen Carl.
