It was that beautiful.<PARAGRAPH>Equality 7-2521 also understood that it had been his sense of himself - of \"I\" - that revolted against his society and made him sin. No matter how hard society might try, that \"I\" can never be completely destroyed by it.<PARAGRAPH>Equality 7-2521 spent days reading the books he found.
