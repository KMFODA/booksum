{"name": "Chapter 2", "summary": "As it turns out, the regiment doesn't head for battle - not yet, anyway. This gives Henry days to sweat it out and wonder if he's really a chicken.<PARAGRAPH>His moods swing wildly, as they will continue to do for the rest of the novel.<PARAGRAPH>Henry feels alone. He thinks that all the other guys in his regiment are either totally brave or totally chicken and hiding it better than he is.<PARAGRAPH>There is much talk by generals of fighting, and also much talk of getting cigars, and much stroking of mustaches.<PARAGRAPH>Finally, the men move out. Even though they are supposedly heading into battle, a circus-like atmosphere prevails. There is lots of joking. One guy tries to swipe a horse from a neighboring farm and its owner, a young girl, succeeds in getting it back.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>The men camp for the night, and Henry plucks at blades of grass to denote self-pity. He wishes he were back home on the farm milking the cows that now  \"have a halo of happiness about each of their heads\" .<PARAGRAPH>Wilson, a.k.a. \"the Loud Soldier\", asks, \"What the thunder is wrong with you, you thunder-head?\"<PARAGRAPH>Henry says to shut the thunder up. He again  brings up the idea of running away, to test Wilson's reaction.<PARAGRAPH>The loud soldier says he won't run, Henry asks how the thunder he knows, and the men get into a little spat before Wilson stomps off , leaving Henry more alone than ever.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422200850/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/red-badge-of-courage/summary/chapter-2"}
