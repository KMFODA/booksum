Everyone agrees that this is best.<PARAGRAPH>After a few more jabs at the French, Chamberlain asks Lovell where he's off to.<PARAGRAPH>Lovell's off to Wolsey's house, of course, and Chamberlain and Lovell are invited, too.<PARAGRAPH>Lovell says Wolsey is \"bounteous,\" and Chamberlain follows that up by saying that he's \"noble,\" too. Sands couldn't agree more. Wolsey is such a great \"example\" to all of them.<PARAGRAPH>The men sing Wolsey's praises as they run off to his house for dinner.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201030103416/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/henry-viii/summary/act-1-scene-3"}
