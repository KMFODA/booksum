{"name": "Chapter 5", "summary": "Every day of Mary's life is the same: wake up, get bored inside, go outside, run around. Wash, rinse, repeat.<PARAGRAPH>All of this outdoorsy stuff makes her appetite better, so her health seems to be improving.<PARAGRAPH>She goes looking around all the gardens, but she keeps going back to the wall covered in thick ivy that doesn't seem to have a door.<PARAGRAPH>As she looks up at the ivy one day, she hears a chirp from Ben's robin.<PARAGRAPH>This isn't a Chronicles-of-Narnia-style talking robin, but it still seems to have something to say to Mary.<PARAGRAPH>The robin chirps at her and she runs after him all along the wall, until she realizes that it's the enclosed garden Mr. Craven had locked up. The robin must live inside the garden.<PARAGRAPH>Mary asks Martha about why Mr. Craven hates the walled garden so much.<PARAGRAPH>Martha tells her the  backstory: Mr. Craven and his wife used to garden there together.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Craven had a favorite old tree with a bent branch where she liked to sit and read, but one day, the branch broke, and she fell and died of her injuries.<PARAGRAPH>So Mr. Craven, mad with grief, had the garden sealed off in her memory.<PARAGRAPH>As Mary sits thinking this story over, she hears a sound over the wind.<PARAGRAPH>It sounds like somebody's crying somewhere in the house--a child.<PARAGRAPH>Martha insists that it's no one--or if it is someone, it's the maid Betty Butterworth.<PARAGRAPH>Martha's not exactly a great liar, and it's clear Mary isn't satisfied by this answer.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210125021046/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/the-secret-garden/summary/chapter-5"}
