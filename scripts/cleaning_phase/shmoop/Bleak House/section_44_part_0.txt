{"name": "Chapter 44", "summary": "<PARAGRAPH>The next morning Esther tells Jarndyce the rest of the story, which is, Oh, yeah, please don't tell anyone.<PARAGRAPH>He's obviously fine with that, and everything is hunky dory.<PARAGRAPH>Esther is worried about anyone else finding out, though. There's Tulkinghorn, who might know; Guppy, who she's pretty sure will stop poking around about her background, like she asked; and Hortense, who was so weird when she came to ask for a job.<PARAGRAPH>Jarndyce says they can't really do anything about any of that, so not to worry.<PARAGRAPH>He also says he has something to ask her, but he can't ask outright, so he'll write a letter.<PARAGRAPH>She's all gratitude and feeling like she owes him big-time.<PARAGRAPH>A week later she receives the letter. It's a...proposal of marriage! Yes, yes, we all saw that coming, obviously.<PARAGRAPH>But still - isn't a tiny bit creepy, considering how she thinks of him as a dad, and how indebted she feels to him? It's a bit too much of a power imbalance to be OK.<PARAGRAPH>The letter is nice and sweet and loving, and Jarndyce makes sure to say that no matter what her answer, it won't change how he feels about her.<PARAGRAPH>Esther also reads between the lines to see that he's asking her now that she's no longer pretty, because she's unlikely to get another offer.<PARAGRAPH>She starts to cry. Then she feels guilty for not being instantly happy about this and for still thinking about Woodcourt.<PARAGRAPH>Finally Esther makes up her mind to say yes and burns the dried bouquet that Woodcourt gave her before he left for China.<PARAGRAPH>A week goes by. Jarndyce doesn't say anything about the letter and acts totally normal.<PARAGRAPH>Two weeks go by.<PARAGRAPH>Esther comes to see him and says she has an answer. She hugs and kisses him. It's kind of an odd moment - instead of calling her his wife or his love or whatever, Jarndyce is psyched and calls her \"the mistress of Bleak House,\" like she's marrying the house and not him . She doesn't tell Ada.<PARAGRAPH>Whatever. We told you it was kind of weird.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201219154950/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/bleak-house/summary/chapter-44"}
