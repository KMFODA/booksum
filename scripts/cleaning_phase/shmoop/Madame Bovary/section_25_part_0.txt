{"name": "Part 3, Chapter 2", "summary": "Emma returns to the inn, and finds that she's missed the Hirondelle, which was there to pick her up earlier. She hires a cab and catches up to the stagecoach. She returns home.<PARAGRAPH>Once there, Felicite sends her next door to the Homais house, saying that it's urgent.<PARAGRAPH>It's jam making day in Yonville, a particularly hectic time.<PARAGRAPH>At chez Homais, Emma discovers the pharmacist's family in an uproar. It turns out that Justin almost made a fatal mistake - he almost used a pan for jam that was dangerously close to the jar of arsenic.<PARAGRAPH>Homais is unbelievably angry; his wife and the children freak out, as though they'd already been poisoned. Emma observes all this, as Homais goes through the whole chain of events again.<PARAGRAPH>Poor Justin. Things just go from bad to worse for him. As Homais shakes him back and forth angrily, a book falls out of his pocket. Not just any book...a book called Conjugal Love. With pictures. The children are struck dumb, and Homais snatches it away furiously.<PARAGRAPH>At this point, Emma successfully breaks into the conversation. She asks what's wrong.<PARAGRAPH>Homais bluntly tells her that her father-in-law, the elder Monsieur Bovary, is dead.<PARAGRAPH>Emma goes to find Charles as Homais cools down a bit, still grumbling.<PARAGRAPH>Charles has been waiting for his wife, and tearfully greets her with a hug and kiss. Emma, remembering Leon, is grossed out by her husband. She responds with an extraordinary lack of sympathy.<PARAGRAPH>Charles, poor man, just thinks that Emma is struck by grief, when in reality, she just doesn't know what to say, and doesn't feel anything.<PARAGRAPH>Hippolyte limps in, bringing Emma's bags. Emma is embarrassed as ever by his presence, a symbol of Charles's failures.<PARAGRAPH>The next day, Charles's mother arrives. Mother and son are debilitated by grief; Emma is unmoved. Instead, she's daydreaming about Leon.<PARAGRAPH>Monsieur Lheureux, who seems to have an incredible radar system for knowing the absolute worst time for stopping by, stops by.<PARAGRAPH>The merchant and Emma step aside to discuss business. Lheureux slyly proposes another lending arrangement - knowing that Emma is a fool with money, he wants Charles to give her power of attorney , so he can deal with her.<PARAGRAPH>Soon enough, he returns with yards of black fabric for a mourning dress.<PARAGRAPH>Lheureux keeps pushing Emma about the whole power of attorney business, which she doesn't really understand. However, she figures things out soon enough.<PARAGRAPH>As soon as Charles's mother leaves, Emma goes into financier mode. She has a document drawn up by the notary, which gives her control over the family's money and loans.<PARAGRAPH>Charles is amazed by what seems like Emma's common sense. She slyly suggests that they should have someone else look over the notarized document before they sign it - and Charles himself sends her to Rouen to meet with Leon. She's gone for three days.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210422061745/http://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/madame-bovary/summary/part-3-chapter-2"}
