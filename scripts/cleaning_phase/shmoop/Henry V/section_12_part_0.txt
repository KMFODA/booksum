With her heavy French accent, Catherine makes the English word \"foot\" sound a lot like the French word \"foutre\" . She also makes the English word \"gown\" sound a lot like the French word \"con\" .", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210119060217/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/henry-v/summary/act-3-scene-4"}
