{"name": "Act 5, Scene 8", "summary": "When we catch up with Hector, he's standing over the formerly armored Greek soldier, collecting the armor for his trophy case.<PARAGRAPH>Hector notices that underneath all that \"goodly armor,\" the guy is just a \"putrefied core,\" a.k.a. rotting flesh. <PARAGRAPH>Next, Hector decides to take a little breather from the battle. He removes his helmet and armor. <PARAGRAPH>Then he talks lovingly to his sword and tells it that it deserves to \"rest\" too, since it's been so busy getting its \"fill of blood and death.\"<PARAGRAPH>Achilles and the Myrmidon hooligans show up and surround Hector. Achilles says something like \"You're done, son.\"<PARAGRAPH>Hector points out that he's unarmed. <PARAGRAPH>Well, so much for nobility. Achilles gives the signal to his goons and they strike Hector down.<PARAGRAPH>After Hector falls, Achilles celebrates over the dead body like he's just scored the game-winning touchdown of the Super Bowl. He declares that Troy is about to go down next. <PARAGRAPH>Now, Achilles talks about  his sword and says that its tummy isn't  quite full from all the blood and guts it's \"fed\" on that day. But, Hector was a tasty little snack, so his sword is satisfied... for now.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>Achilles then has his gang of hoodlums tie Hector's body to his horse's tail so it can be dragged around the field.
