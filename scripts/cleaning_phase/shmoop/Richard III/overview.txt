{"name": "Overview", "summary": "Read the full text of Richard III with a side-by-side translation HERE.<PARAGRAPH>Richard is Duke of Gloucester, and, man, is he unhappy about it. He tells us that his brother Edward has become the king of England after a series of long civil wars  between his people  and the Lancasters.  Despite the happy news about King Edward and his family's victory, Richard is bummed and feels inadequate because 1) he was born a \"deformed\" hunchback and 2) he's got no love life to speak of.  Richard lets the audience in on a big secret: to amuse himself, he's hatched an evil-genius plot to get his hands on the crown.<PARAGRAPH>Clearly Richard's got his work cut out for him, so he wastes no time.  First he needs to get his older brother George , who is next in line for the throne, out of the way.  He tells us he's manipulated King Edward into believing a prophesy warning that Edward's heirs will be murdered by a family member associated with the letter \"G.\"  *G*eorge, Duke of Clarence is jailed and accused of treason.  <PARAGRAPH>Next Richard thinks that marrying Lady Anne  would be politically strategic.  So he puts the moves on Anne during her father-in-law's funeral procession and convinces her to marry him, even though she knows that Richard is responsible for the deaths of her husband and his father.  <PARAGRAPH>With Lady Anne under his thumb, Richard quickly moves on to the task of having Clarence executed so he can get that much closer to the throne.  Richard sends a couple of murderers to do the deed.  They go to the Tower of London, stab the Duke of Clarence, and ditch his body in a vat of wine.<PARAGRAPH>When the sickly king finds out his brother is dead, he blames himself and becomes even sicklier.    When Edward IV finally croaks, his son, young Prince Edward, is the immediate heir to the throne.  Since the kid is so young, Richard becomes England's \"Lord Protector,\" which means he's basically in charge until the little guy's old enough to rule competently.<PARAGRAPH>But Richard's still not happy.  He wants the crown for himself, and there are too many people out there who are loyal to Prince Edward and his little brother.  Richard has the two princes locked up in the Tower of London for their \"protection\" and then kills a bunch of their followers and some relatives on their mom's side of the family.<PARAGRAPH>Next, with his wingman Buckingham's help, Richard campaigns hard for the throne, while pretending he's not interested in it. He successfully snags the crown and acts like he's doing England a really big favor.<PARAGRAPH>But Richard's still not happy. He orders Buckingham to snuff out the little princes.    Buckingham gets nervous and waffles, so Richard quickly runs out and hires a hit man , who has no problem killing kids.  Tyrell outsources the job to a couple thugs who smother the little boys in their sleep.  Since Buckingham turned out to be such a wimp, Richard puts Buckingham on his list of enemies, which means the guy is as good as dead.<PARAGRAPH>Meanwhile, the Earl of Richmond  is gathering troops and allies in France so he can storm England and take Richard down.  Also, the everyday Joes of England have caught on to Richard's shenanigans and have just about had it with the guy.  Plus, Richard's mom  has finally turned against her son and has cursed him to die in battle.  <PARAGRAPH>Richard couldn't care less about his mom, but he knows he could be stripped of his crown. So he decides he needs a new wife whose family ties will help strengthen his claim to the throne.  He spreads a rumor that his current wife  is sick, then has her murdered.<PARAGRAPH>Next, Richard meets with his sister-in-law, old Queen Elizabeth, and tries to convince her that she should let him marry her daughter, young Elizabeth.    Old Queen Elizabeth is all \"Yeah, Richard, that could work,\"  but secretly she's negotiated young Elizabeth's marriage to Richmond .<PARAGRAPH>Geesh.  We need to stop and take a breather, because Shakespeare  is zooming through about 14 years of history in five acts.  <PARAGRAPH>Let's quickly recap, because, even though Richard III is one of Shakespeare's longest works, Richard has motored through the play like a teenager with a long list of chores and a hot date.  We're not kidding.  If he had a \"to-do\" list, here's what it would look like:<PARAGRAPH> Get older brother Clarence out of the way Marry Lady Ann Neville Wait until Edward IV croaks  Become Lord Protector of England Kill off anyone who supports the rightful heirs to the throne  Become king Murder the young princes  Murder current wifeMarry niece  Beat up RichmondRule England forever<PARAGRAPH>OK, let's get back to the plot.  Richard can't just ignore Richmond, so he throws together an army and assembles them at Bosworth Field for the big rumble.  Richard tries to stay up all night outlining a strategy so he can get the drop on Richmond, but he falls asleep.  He has a scary nightmare where all the ghosts of his murder victims show up and tell him that he's going down.    Uh oh.  Time is definitely running out for our villain.<PARAGRAPH>Richard wakes up and has an \"Ah ha!\" moment in which he talks to himself as if he's been split into two people, like Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies.  He realizes that he's all alone on the world, that he's a murderer and an all-around bad guy with no conscience to speak of.  Instead of scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist who could help him with his personality disorder, he says something like, \"Oh well, I'm not going to be changing my evil ways any time soon.\"<PARAGRAPH>In the morning Richard heads to battle and is quickly knocked off his horse.  He loses all composure and famously shouts, \"A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!\"  Richmond shows up and kills Richard in battle without uttering a single word.  <PARAGRAPH>Richmond then helps himself to the English crown and becomes King Henry VII.  King Henry VII then makes a big, fancy speech about how awesome his reign will be.  It's a pretty great speech - go to \"What's Up With The Ending?\" and we'll tell you all about it.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210624200133/https:/www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/richard-iii/summary"}
