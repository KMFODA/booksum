{"name": "Act 5, Scene 2", "summary": "Richmond has made camp at Tamworth, only a day's march from where Richard is encamped at Leicester.<PARAGRAPH>As Richmond and his men have been marching across England to face Richard, he has been receiving encouraging and informative letters about Richard's placement and army strength from his stepfather Stanley, who is still in Richard's fold.<PARAGRAPH>Richmond gives a rousing and beautiful speech to his followers about the damage that Richard has caused to England and to each individual citizen. Richmond hails this battle as the final bloody push to bring a lasting peace to the land.<PARAGRAPH>His men believe that conscience is on their side, which makes up for any numbers they might lack. One man fighting for his convictions is as good as a thousand men.<PARAGRAPH>Also, Richard's forces are waning in number: those who fight beside him do so out of fear more than love. This can't bode well for Richard on the field, as his men will likely desert as soon as they're given the chance.<PARAGRAPH>Richmond, with a final note that his men fight on the side of true hope, inspires his men to march on to battle.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210504161507/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/richard-iii/summary/act-5-scene-2"}
