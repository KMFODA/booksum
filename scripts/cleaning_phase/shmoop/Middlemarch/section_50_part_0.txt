{"name": "Book 5, Chapter 51", "summary": "Will hasn't heard the gossip about the codicil in Mr. Casaubon's will.<PARAGRAPH>He hasn't been invited to Brooke's house as often as before, but he continues to work on the Pioneer for Brooke.<PARAGRAPH>Will is afraid that they're trying to keep him away from Dorothea, and is annoyed at the thought that they suspect him of trying to seduce a rich and newly widowed woman.<PARAGRAPH>But he continues to see Brooke at the Pioneer office, and continues to coach him on speeches and politics.<PARAGRAPH>Brooke is as inconsistent as ever, but, with help from Will, it's not showing as badly.<PARAGRAPH>Or so Will hopes: the time has come for Brooke to give a public speech, and he's bad enough at speaking coherently in private that everyone is nervous for him.<PARAGRAPH>The speech starts out okay, but then Brooke starts rambling about nothing.<PARAGRAPH>And then someone in the crowd holds up a kind of effigy, or life-sized model, of Brooke on a stick to mimic him.<PARAGRAPH>Brooke has always been easily distracted, and the effigy pulls him even further off track.<PARAGRAPH>The speech really goes to pot when the crowd starts throwing rotten vegetables at him.<PARAGRAPH>Will Ladislaw and the rest of the committee that has been working for Brooke look \"grim\" when Brooke comes back in from his failed speech.<PARAGRAPH>Will considers quitting his job at the Pioneer. He wants to go away and do something brilliant that will elevate him socially. He wants to put himself on a level with Dorothea and erase the social gap between them.<PARAGRAPH>He doesn't want to go without seeing Dorothea first.<PARAGRAPH>But then Brooke tells him that he's planning on selling the Pioneer, and therefore he won't need Will to stay on as editor anymore.<PARAGRAPH>This is just the excuse Will needed to leave Middlemarch to seek his fortune elsewhere, but he doesn't want to leave \"because they are afraid\" of him.<PARAGRAPH>He has a feeling that Brooke and his friends are trying to push him away either because of politics or because of Dorothea.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210307064824/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/middlemarch/summary/book-5-chapter-51"}
