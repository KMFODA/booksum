{"name": "Book 6, Chapter 56", "summary": "Caleb tells his wife that Mrs. Casaubon  is sensible, and understands how farms should operate.<PARAGRAPH>Dorothea has hired him as manager for all the farms on the Lowick estate.<PARAGRAPH>Caleb Garth is rapidly getting more work than he can do by himself.<PARAGRAPH>Eliot steps back to give us some broader historical context: the steam engine has been invented, and railroads are spreading all over England.<PARAGRAPH>Some farmers are anxious about it. They're afraid that the noise of the trains will be bad for their livestock if the railroad goes through their property.<PARAGRAPH>Many people in the Lowick area don't trust the railroad, partly because they don't really understand what it is.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Solomon Featherstone  lives in the area, and he contributes to the mistrust and misunderstanding of the rest of the farmers about the railroad.<PARAGRAPH>One day, Caleb Garth is out measuring a piece of land for Dorothea that she was planning on selling to a railroad company.<PARAGRAPH>A group of railroad agents is there, too, to discuss the matter with Mr. Garth.<PARAGRAPH>But then a group of angry farm workers  show up and start to threaten the railroad agents.<PARAGRAPH>Caleb and his assistant, a seventeen-year-old boy, hurry to get between the two groups, and Caleb's assistant gets knocked down.<PARAGRAPH>Just then, Fred Vincy shows up on horseback .<PARAGRAPH>He has the advantage of being on horseback, and intimidates the group of farm workers.<PARAGRAPH>The young assistant has a broken arm, so Caleb sends him away on Fred's horse.<PARAGRAPH>Caleb is annoyed that he won't be able to finish his day's work on his own, but Fred volunteers to help him.<PARAGRAPH>Caleb then leaves Fred for a few minutes to go and scold the farm laborers for attacking the railroad people.<PARAGRAPH>He figures someone has been spreading false rumors about the railroad, and he's right.<PARAGRAPH>The farm workers sulk a bit, but promise not to get in the way again.<PARAGRAPH>Caleb and Fred finish the day's work of measuring in the field, and Fred has a grand time working outdoors and using his head at the same time.<PARAGRAPH>He asks Caleb if he thinks that he could learn his business, and admits that he's in love with Mary Garth.<PARAGRAPH>Caleb considers it for a while, and decides that he'd be doing a favor to Mary and to Fred if he agreed to hire Fred and teach him the business.<PARAGRAPH>He tells Fred to meet him at his office the next morning, and goes home to tell his wife, Susan Garth, about his decision.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Garth is disappointed, in a way. She was hoping that Mary would marry Mr. Farebrother, but she's proud of her husband for being so generous to Fred.<PARAGRAPH>The next morning, Fred sets to work - at a desk.<PARAGRAPH>He's good at arithmetic, but his handwriting is terrible.<PARAGRAPH>Caleb Garth can't stand bad handwriting, or bad handiwork of any kind. He says Fred will have to work hard at improving it.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Garth promises a decent starting salary to Fred, and Fred goes home to break the news to his family.<PARAGRAPH>His father's disappointed, but not all that angry, and Mrs. Vincy cries a bit.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Vincy cheers her up by reminding her that Rosamond wanted pity as much as Fred - after all, Mr. Lydgate is going into debt! What a cheering thought.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210307064824/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/middlemarch/summary/book-6-chapter-56"}
