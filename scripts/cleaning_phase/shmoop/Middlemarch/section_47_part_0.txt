{"name": "Book 5, Chapter 48", "summary": "Dorothea wasn't really annoyed with Will for coming - she was sad that Mr. Casaubon ignored him, and that's why she looked uncomfortable.<PARAGRAPH>Dorothea usually spends Sunday afternoons reading, but she can't get into any of her usual favorites.<PARAGRAPH>She feels like her life is empty, and that she'll never see Will - or any other person in the outside world - again.<PARAGRAPH>After dinner, he asks her to read his huge volume of notes out loud to him, and mark the places where he stops her.<PARAGRAPH>This is part of the \"sifting\" process - he wants to go through the notes and research he's made over the years, to finally get going on the book itself.<PARAGRAPH>Dorothea suspects that he's finally decided to start putting the book together because Lydgate warned him that his health might not last.<PARAGRAPH>He even wakes her up during the night to continue working on it by candlelight, and Dorothea doesn't complain.<PARAGRAPH>Before they go back to sleep, Casaubon asks her to make a solemn promise: if he dies, she has to swear up and down not to do anything of which he would disapprove.<PARAGRAPH>Dorothea is shocked that he'd ask her to make a promise like this - doesn't he trust her?<PARAGRAPH>She hedges for a while, and finally asks that he let her wait until the next day to make the promise.<PARAGRAPH>She wants to sleep on it.<PARAGRAPH>She imagines that he wants her to promise to finish sifting through his research, and publish his book, after he dies.<PARAGRAPH>It's not work that she enjoys, and she can't imagine wasting years on a project that she didn't even begin.<PARAGRAPH>But then again, he's spent years and years on this already, and to tell him that she's going to throw away his work as soon as he's dead seems cruel.<PARAGRAPH>At breakfast, she tells Casaubon that she'll meet him out in the garden to give him her answer: she's decided to say yes, and is pretty miserable about it.<PARAGRAPH>When she gets to the garden, she finds him sitting with his head down on a table.<PARAGRAPH>He's dead.<PARAGRAPH>And Dorothea faints.
