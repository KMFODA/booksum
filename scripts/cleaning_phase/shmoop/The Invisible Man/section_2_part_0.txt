{"name": "Chapter 3", "summary": "We learn here that the stranger came to Iping on February 29th. . So let's all agree that it's hard to keep track of time.)<PARAGRAPH>The next day, the stranger's luggage is brought from the station by a man named Fearenside, who has a dog, which makes Fearenside our favorite character so far.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger has lots of luggage, including boxes of glass bottles cushioned by straw. Naturally.<PARAGRAPH>He would probably love to yell at people to be careful with his boxes, but Fearenside's dog attacks him and rips his glove and pants.<PARAGRAPH>The stranger runs back to his room to change his clothes.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Hall, nice guy that he is, checks on the stranger to make sure he wasn't hurt. But when he enters the room without knocking , he sees something strange. Unfortunately for the reader, Hall gets pushed out of the room before he can figure out what he saw.<PARAGRAPH>The villagers are now hanging around the luggage, gossiping and saying what they would do if a dog bit them. These people clearly don't have TVs.<PARAGRAPH>When the unhurt stranger gets the boxes, he starts unpacking all of his bottles and gets to work immediately.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Hall brings him dinner, but - surprise, surprise! - enters without knocking. So, of course, two things happen:  she catches a glimpse of something strange ; and  he complains about being interrupted.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Hall fusses over the mess that he's making, but the stranger just tells her to bill him.<PARAGRAPH>Down at a local bar, Fearenside and Henfrey gossip about the stranger. Fearenside says the stranger has black legs - he apparently saw the leg when his dog ripped his pants. Since the stranger has a pink nose, says Fearenside, maybe he's colored like a piebald horse.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210126034801/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/invisible-man-wells/summary/chapter-3"}
