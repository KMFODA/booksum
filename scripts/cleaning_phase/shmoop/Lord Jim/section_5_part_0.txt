{"name": "Chapter 6", "summary": "Back at the trial, we meet a Captain Brierly through the eyes of Marlow. Brierly was one of the three men sitting in judgment at the trial, and apparently he was quite the successful, well-regarded guy.<PARAGRAPH>Too bad, then, that he committed suicide right after the trial concluded. His suicide is a big mystery, but Marlow, for one, has his theories. He thinks Captain B killed himself because of Jim; Jim's case hit a little too close to home for the Captain, and he realized that he, too, could behave as badly as Jim. Or that's Marlow's theory, anyway.<PARAGRAPH>Marlow later meets up with Jones, who served with Brierly. He gives Marlow the lowdown on Brierly's suicide - what he knows about it, at least. He can't figure out why Brierly did it because Captain B was \"Young, healthy, well off, no cares... I sit here sometimes thinking, thinking, till my head fairly begins to buzz. There was some reason.\" <PARAGRAPH>Anyways, let's get back to the matter at hand, shall we? <PARAGRAPH>The crew of the Patna has shown up on land sans ship, which is a big old problem, and now Jim is on trial for whatever he did wrong.<PARAGRAPH>At the trial, Brierly and Marlow have a conversation about Jim. Horrified by the publicity the trial is getting, Captain B wishes Jim would just skip town so the naval community could stop being so embarrassed.<PARAGRAPH>At this, Marlow wanders outside, where a dude comments on a \"wretched cur,\" referring to a stray dog. Poor Jim overhears and thinks the \"cur\" jab was aimed at him.<PARAGRAPH>Uh oh. He gets mad and attacks Marlow, who calms him down and explains the misunderstanding. This Jim fellow is one awkward guy.<PARAGRAPH>In a moment of kindness, or perhaps just curiosity, Marlow invites Jim to dine with him at his hotel, and Jim agrees. This should be interesting...", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118112654/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/lord-jim/summary/chapter-6"}
