She longs to escape from the convent.<PARAGRAPH>In a moment of passion, Isabel asks Pansy to come away to England with her, but Pansy can't go against her father's wishes, even if she wants to.<PARAGRAPH>Pansy says that she had done a lot of thinking, and that she is more willing than ever to obey her father.
