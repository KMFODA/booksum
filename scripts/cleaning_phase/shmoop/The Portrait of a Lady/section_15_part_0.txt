{"name": "Chapter 16", "summary": "Isabel is in desperate need of some alone time - a lot has happened in her world recently.<PARAGRAPH>Unexpectedly, Caspar Goodwood arrives. Henrietta apparently wrote to him and let him know that Isabel would be alone that evening. Kind of sneaky, sure; but, hey - that's Henrietta.<PARAGRAPH>Caspar Goodwood asks Isabel why she never wrote him back. She says that her silence was intentional. Oh, snap.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel demands that Caspar stay away from her -- for at least two years.<PARAGRAPH>Caspar worries that she will marry someone else. Isabel insists that she doesn't want to get married at all.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel tells Caspar that she has turned down an English nobleman, and admits that she sort of thought of Caspar when she did it, which gives Caspar some consolation.<PARAGRAPH>Caspar admits that he was invited to Gardencourt by way of Henrietta, which adds yet another tick on the old \"Why, Henrietta, Why?\" list.<PARAGRAPH>Caspar said that he declined because it didn't seem like the invitation was coming from Isabel. Isabel thanks him for this propriety.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel shudders at the thought of Caspar and Lord Warburton possibly meeting - she would have felt bad for Lord Warburton.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel says that she plans to stay in Europe for a while. She says that the world is small, but Caspar claims that it is too big. He feels the distance between the two of them.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel declares, once again, that her personal freedom is very important to her.<PARAGRAPH>Caspar insists that he wants to marry her in order to liberate her and, supposedly, give her more opportunities.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel insists that Caspar keeps his distance from her. Caspar jokes that she's going to do something criminal. Isabel doesn't deny it; she says she would like the freedom to do anything, even something atrocious.<PARAGRAPH>Caspar promises to reenter her life after two years.<PARAGRAPH>Caspar does not leave until Isabel leaves the room.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel retreats and collapses at the foot of her bed.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508161644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/portrait-of-a-lady/summary/chapter-16"}
