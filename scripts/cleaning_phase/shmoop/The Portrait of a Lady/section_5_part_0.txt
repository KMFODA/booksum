{"name": "Chapter 6", "summary": "Finally, we get a detailed glimpse of young Miss Archer. Isabel thinks quite highly of herself - actually, everyone thinks quite highly of her. She's intelligent, creative, and, most certainly, in the words of Lord Warburton, an interesting woman. Her pride is one of her distinguishing characteristics - though it can come off as arrogance sometimes, she is the first to admit when she's made a mistake. Her greatest desire is to perfect herself.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel's best friend is Henrietta Stackpole, another independent, intelligent, and apparently quite interesting young woman. Henrietta is some kind of intrepid girl-reporter, and supports her sister's young children with her earnings.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel, like Henrietta, considers independence very important, and thinks that women should be able to live without men. She vaguely wonders about marriage, but has never been in love.<PARAGRAPH>Isabel reminds Mr. Touchett a little of the young Mrs. Touchett.<PARAGRAPH>Newly planted in English soil, Isabel is very curious to know about the country and its people. She asks Mr. Touchett if England really is how it's depicted in books.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Touchett says that anything he's learned he's learned by observation and participation, not from second-hand sources. The amiable pair discusses the role of the American in England, undefined by social class.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Touchett says that English people are very \"inconsistent,\" which pleases Isabel, since she herself is unpredictable, too.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210508161644/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/portrait-of-a-lady/summary/chapter-6"}
