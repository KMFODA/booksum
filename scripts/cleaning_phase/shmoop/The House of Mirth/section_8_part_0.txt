She would rather her other companion, Grace Stepney, help out with re-decorating, although generally she finds Lily to be a more interesting person.<PARAGRAPH>Cut to Lily, who, alone, hears the doorbell ring and is told that a \"Mrs. Haffen\" is waiting, whoever that is.<PARAGRAPH>Lily agrees to see her, and it turns out to be the same charwoman we've now met twice. She has something to show Lily, a package wrapped in dirty newspapers.<PARAGRAPH>This can't be good.<PARAGRAPH>It turns out to be a packet of letters. Mrs. Haffen starts talking about her own financial problems. And we all smell blackmail...<PARAGRAPH>The package turns out to be a collection of letters which Selden threw out, but failed to burn. He only ripped them up into big pieces, which the charwoman put back together.<PARAGRAPH>Lily feels physically ill from being a part of this \"vileness.\" But she does happen to recognize the handwriting in the letters: Mrs. Dorset's. She also realizes that these letters from Mrs. Dorset to Selden are actually quite recent.<PARAGRAPH>Lily suddenly concludes that she has major, major power over Mrs. Dorset .<PARAGRAPH>But, the fact is, she's just too disgusted by the dinginess of the situation to want to take part in it.

She needs money for them; otherwise, Lily's reputation will be ruined.<PARAGRAPH>Now Lily understands: this charwoman thinks the letters came from her .<PARAGRAPH>Lily considers the fact that Selden, too - not just Mrs. Dorset - is on the line here.<PARAGRAPH>So she negotiates the price and purchases the letters. Mrs. Haffen leaves.<PARAGRAPH><PARAGRAPH>Just about then, Mrs. Peniston shows up, wanting to hear all the juicy details about the wedding: who was wearing what, who gave what as gifts, what were the decorations like, etc.<PARAGRAPH>Lily doesn't feel like playing this game, considering everything that's just gone down.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Peniston, who apparently doesn't know about Lily's past with Gryce, talks excitedly of his engagement to Evie. She says that Mrs. Dorset played Cupid in the matchmaking...<PARAGRAPH>Lily excuses herself and heads up to bed.<PARAGRAPH>Now, she had planned on burning the letters - until Mrs. Peniston reminded her of Mrs. Dorset's vindictiveness.
