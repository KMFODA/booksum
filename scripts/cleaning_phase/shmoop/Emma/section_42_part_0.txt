{"name": "Chapter Forty-Three", "summary": "The next day, the exact same crew of people head up to Box Hill.<PARAGRAPH>You could think of this party as a nightmare version of day 1 .<PARAGRAPH>It's hot, nobody seems very excited about anything, and conversation sort of sucks.<PARAGRAPH>They all sit down on a hill, and Emma decides to liven things up a bit.<PARAGRAPH>She and Frank start flirting outrageously with each other. Sure, she knows that everybody else is listening - and that it's ridiculously inappropriate - but she's in a strangely elated mood.<PARAGRAPH>Frank, too, seems strangely driven to wild moods.<PARAGRAPH>He's overly bright and far, far too attentive to Emma.<PARAGRAPH>He asks everyone to share what they're thinking with Emma.<PARAGRAPH>No one takes them up on the offer.<PARAGRAPH>The two propose a game: each of the party will say one very witty thing - or two sort of witty things - or three boring things. Emma will judge who wins.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Bates laughs and observes that she won't have to worry, then - at the very least, she can come up with three dull things.<PARAGRAPH>Emma, high on her own energy, replies that Miss Bates' problem will be limiting herself to only three boring things.<PARAGRAPH>There's a dreadful pause.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Bates slowly figures out what Emma meant.<PARAGRAPH>She's very humble, so she just turns to Mr. Knightley and says that she must have been really boring for Emma to have said something so awful to an old friend.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Weston comes up with a clever pun on Emma's name. The company laughs.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley declares that if this is to be the focus of the game, he won't participate.<PARAGRAPH>In other words, he's not too fond of an Emma love-fest.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Elton throws a hissy-fit. For obvious reasons.<PARAGRAPH>By and large, the party disintegrates unhappily.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. and Mrs. Elton walk off. As they do, Frank makes a sarcastic remark about the \"happy couple.\"<PARAGRAPH>Jane gravely replies that a couple that meets too quickly often finds later that they're not compatible.<PARAGRAPH>Frank, more excited than ever, asks Emma to promise to select his wife.<PARAGRAPH>That way, she'll be perfect. Like Emma. Aww....<PARAGRAPH>He declares that he's leaving for Europe for a few years.<PARAGRAPH>When he returns, he wants his wife to be waiting for him!<PARAGRAPH>Emma laughs and agrees to find him a woman.<PARAGRAPH>As they're about to leave, Mr. Knightley pulls Emma aside.<PARAGRAPH>He chastises her for speaking so cruelly to Miss Bates.<PARAGRAPH>Although Emma is immediately ashamed and sorry, she pretends not to understand him.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley explains why he's so upset: Miss Bates is poor, and she's seen her station in society sink as her money has dwindled.<PARAGRAPH>She's only ever been kind to Emma.<PARAGRAPH>Being mean to Miss Bates, in other words, is sort of like kicking a hurt puppy - only the most uncaring person would ever think of it.<PARAGRAPH>Deeply ashamed, Emma turns her face away - and so she misses the chance to tell Mr. Knightley how sorry she truly is.<PARAGRAPH>The carriages roll away.<PARAGRAPH>Emma cries all the way home.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-forty-three"}
