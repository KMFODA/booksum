{"name": "Chapter Nineteen", "summary": "Emma decides to pay a long-overdue visit to the Bateses.<PARAGRAPH>She'd go more often, but...well, they're just so poor. And, of course, there's the fact that Miss Bates only stops talking to gasp for air.<PARAGRAPH>As she and Harriet walk to the Bateses' house, Emma feels a slight tinge of guilt: Mr. Knightley's tried to lecture her about her social responsibility towards the Bateses before.<PARAGRAPH>At least Emma's timed her visit to avoid hearing about Miss Bates' niece, Jane Fairfax.<PARAGRAPH>...or so she thinks.<PARAGRAPH>After blabbering about the Coles  and other nobodies, Miss Bates tells Emma that a letter from Jane has just arrived.<PARAGRAPH>Settle in, folks - it'll be a long afternoon. Miss Bates likes to read all her letters aloud.<PARAGRAPH>And then repeat them for her deaf mother.<PARAGRAPH>Luckily, our heroine outwits the witless Miss Bates.<PARAGRAPH>Emma gets Miss Bates to talk about the letter, not read it. <PARAGRAPH>It turns out that Jane will soon arrive in Highbury.<PARAGRAPH>OK, so you're probably breathless to find out why. Read the book!<PARAGRAPH>Just kidding. Here's why: Jane was raised by the Campbells. Their daughter just got married . Mr. and Mrs. Dixon just left for Ireland, which means that Jane has nowhere to live.<PARAGRAPH>Emma's slightly intrigued by Mr. Dixon. Could he be a spurned lover? When she hears that he once saved Jane's life, she's convinced. Jane is a woman with a past.<PARAGRAPH>And not just any kind of a past: a double-dealing, husband-stealing, dirty kind of a past.<PARAGRAPH>After all, why else would anybody ever choose to live with Mrs. and Miss Bates?<PARAGRAPH>As it turns out, Jane is also pretty sick right now. <PARAGRAPH>Before Miss Bates can repeat all the news again, Emma and Harriet escape. Lucky them.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-nineteen"}
