{"name": "Chapter Thirty-Seven", "summary": "Knowing that Frank plans to come back to Highbury soon causes Emma to think seriously about her affection for Frank.<PARAGRAPH>As soon as she starts thinking about it, though, she realizes that she doesn't really have any affection for Frank.<PARAGRAPH>He's a great friend, sure, but he's just not the upstanding gentleman that she imagined he would be. In other words, imaginary Frank was so, so much better than real Frank. <PARAGRAPH>Frank does indeed arrive within a few days. He and the Westons visit Hartfield.<PARAGRAPH>Emma notices a slight difference in Frank's manners.<PARAGRAPH>He's still fun and engaging, but he doesn't seem to have any affection left for her, either.<PARAGRAPH>Philosophically, Emma determines that absence doesn't make the heart grow fonder. In fact, absence is the best cure for half-formed loves. Like hers and Frank's.<PARAGRAPH>Frank doesn't visit Hartfield again during his stay, proving Emma right once again.<PARAGRAPH>It's got to be hard to be so right all the time, don't you think?<PARAGRAPH>Now that Frank's residence is a mere nine miles from Highbury, however, the Westons decide to resurrect their plans for a ball.<PARAGRAPH>Although he's slightly terrified at the thought of rampant disease, Mr. Woodhouse does agree that a ball in May is less likely to cause a pandemic than a ball in February.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Woodhouse just prays that nothing will happen to the young boys while Emma is out dancing. How could she ever forgive herself? ", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-thirty-seven"}
