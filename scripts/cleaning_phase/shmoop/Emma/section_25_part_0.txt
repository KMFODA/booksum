{"name": "Chapter Twenty-Six", "summary": "Frank returns from London with a spiffy new haircut.<PARAGRAPH>Emma spends some time thinking about the relative virtues of Frank and Mr. Knightley.<PARAGRAPH>There's no way that Mr. Knightley would ever do anything as silly as traveling to get his hair cut.<PARAGRAPH>Even if Mr. Knightley did do something silly, he'd do it better.<PARAGRAPH>And he'd know that it was silly. Frank can't seem to tell the difference between normal and completely ridiculous.<PARAGRAPH>OK, so Frank's a diva. But he's still loveable...right?<PARAGRAPH>The night of the Coles' party arrives.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Bates comes to Hartfield to spend time with Emma's father.<PARAGRAPH>The big news at the party is that someone has given Jane Fairfax a piano. An anonymous someone.<PARAGRAPH>Emma promptly imagines an entire romance between Jane and Mr. Dixon . She tells Frank all about it. He's highly amused.<PARAGRAPH>The two whisper together all through the night.<PARAGRAPH>Other than that, the party is pretty much your everyday trivial social scene. Emma enjoys herself more than she thought she would.<PARAGRAPH>Strangely, Frank keeps staring at Jane. When Emma calls him on it, he makes some snide remarks about Jane's hair.<PARAGRAPH>He even leaves Emma for a bit to say hello to Jane.<PARAGRAPH>Emma wants to see what he says, but Frank's body blocks the way.<PARAGRAPH>After dinner, Mrs. Cole asks Emma and Jane to play on the piano.<PARAGRAPH>Emma's OK at playing the piano - but at least she's learned to work what she's got. She plays a few simple songs.<PARAGRAPH>Surprisingly, Frank Churchill joins in singing. Emma's secretly thrilled.<PARAGRAPH>After Emma plays, Jane plays. Perfectly. Of course.<PARAGRAPH>Frank asks Jane to play again. And again.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley gets angry: Jane has a cold. She shouldn't be straining to play so much.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Knightley convinces Miss Bates to tell Jane to stop.<PARAGRAPH>Emma listens with Mrs. Weston, who has a new theory: she thinks Mr. Knightley is in love with Jane.<PARAGRAPH>After all, who wouldn't be?<PARAGRAPH>Emma's strangely put out by this thought.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Weston's hunch seems to be supported by the fact that Mr. Knightley seems very protective of Jane that evening.", "analysis": null, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210116113822/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/emma/summary/chapter-twenty-six"}
