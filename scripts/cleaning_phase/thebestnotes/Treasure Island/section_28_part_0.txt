Jim sees the group of buccaneers proceeding towards the stockade. \nUnlike Jim, Silver is hardly concerned. When the door opens, one of the men is \npushed ahead to hand over a piece of paper to Silver. Its the Black Spot again. \nSilver condemns their act, as he recognizes the paper as having been cut out of \na bible. He taunts Dick for doing this. At this, George is furious and asks Silver \nto do his part of his duty by reading it. He asks Silver to step down from his \nposition for a common note. In the heated conversation that followed, Silver is \naccused of releasing the prisoners and saving the life of Jim.<PARAGRAPH>Now it \nis Silvers turn to lash out at their arguments and prove his superiority. He \nanswers their arguments one by one. Firstly, he accuses Anderson, Hands, George \nand Davy Jones for crossing him. He goes on to tell them that they will be better \noff as tailors than sailors. As for Jim, he says he is a hostage and killing him \nwould be a waste. He reminds them about the consort. He also reminds them that \nhe was the one who bargained for food without which they would have been, by now, \ncrawling on the floor.<PARAGRAPH>Much to their surprise, he then throws the original \ntreasure map in front of them. The men are dumb founded. Silver gives a final \nwarning to George and asks him to shut his mouth if he wants to live.
