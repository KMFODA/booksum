Dick takes out his Bible and starts praying. \nBut Silver is still not disturbed. He says that he is here to get the seven hundred \nthousand pounds from the Island and that he shall get it. This doesnt charge \nup this crew. Morgan feels that it is the spirits voice and stops Silver from \ncrossing it. Silver reasons out that spirits voice doesnt echo and that it is \nhuman.
