{"name": "chapter 11", "summary": "Jim stays there \nsilently listening to Long John Silver talk. Silver recounts his experiences with \nCaptain Flint. He says that he had lost his leg when he was a quartermaster with \nFlint. On the same broadside exchange of cannon fire, Pew lost his sight. He talks \nabout Roberts men who changed the names of the ships. Jim hears the youngest \ncrewman's voice, after listening to Silver, praising Flint's bravery. He tells \nthem about the time when he was looking and saving all the money but concludes \nthat all the men-Englands and Flints-lived like a pauper before this sail. He \ntells about Old Man Pew who at one time spent almost 12 thousand pounds per year \nbut had to die a beggar. Silver corrects another young man, who says its not worth \nthe trouble, by saying that it depends on the persons discretion and intelligence. \nHe flatters him with the same words he used for Jim. Jim feels deceived when he \noverhears this.<PARAGRAPH>Continuing his boasting, he talks about gentlemen of \nfortune- a term used for pirates-as men who are shrewd at sea and cheerful and \nlively on land. Israel Hands, on the other hand, is getting impatient. He wants \nmutiny right away and asks Silver about his plans. Quieting him, Silver proposes \nhis plan to wait for Captain Smollet, the doctor and the Squire to unearth the \ntreasure and load it in the ship. He plans to attack them only after they have \nnavigated half way back from the Treasure Island.<PARAGRAPH>Silver gets furious \nwith his crew as they dont understand his plans. But his experience and tactful \nnature helps him control them and warns them that he wont spare anyone.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island15.html"}
