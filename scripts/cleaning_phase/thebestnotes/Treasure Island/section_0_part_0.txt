{"name": "chapter 1", "summary": "The story opens with Jim recalling and writing down \nthe experiences he went through on a voyage to Treasure Island as a young boy. \nAs requested by Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey, he takes up the task of recording \nall but one detail -- that of the true location of the island, as the treasure \nstill remains buried there. So, Jim travels back in time and takes the reader \nto where it all started, to his fathers inn -- Admiral Benbow. A lonely seaside \ninn located at Black Hill Cove, patronized mostly by local people and occasionally \nby seamen.<PARAGRAPH>Of the many men visiting his fathers inn, Jims attention, \none day, is captured by a old brown seaman wearing a soiled blue coat, with ragged \nhands, broken nails and a saber cut across one cheek, trudging towards the inn \ndragging a heavy sea chest. Jim notices that the seaman was whistling to himself \nand singing an old sea song. The song went :<PARAGRAPH>\"Fifteen men on the \ndead mans chest Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.<PARAGRAPH>Drink and the devil had \ndone for the rest-Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.....\"<PARAGRAPH>Settling for \na rum, served by Jims father, the old seaman inquires about the cove. He decides \nto get a room at the Admiral Benbow after he finds out that very few people pass \nthrough. He chooses a room on the head of the inn to watch the passing ships and \nintroduces himself as Captain.<PARAGRAPH>The Captains only concern is whether any \nseafaring men have passed by the road and whenever any new men stayed at the inn, \nhe doesnt make his presence felt at all. Jim does not know anything about his \nnew guest except that he has made inquiries to find out about the lovely inns \nalong the coast. Jim gets to know him better when he is asked by the Captain to \nact as a sentinel for a monthly wage of a silver four penny. His task is to watch \nout for a \"seafaring man with one leg\". This strange request to look \nout for a strange man haunts Jim in his dreams.<PARAGRAPH>Jim observes odd behavior \nby the Captain. Sometimes, after getting drunk, he sings his old sea song alone; \nand sometimes he wants other people to sing with him. The others all fear him, \nso they do as he requests. He often frightened the local people with stories about \ndreadful things in shockingly gruesome language. This also brings him his share \nof admirers who called him a true sea dog and a real old sea salt. Though \nJims father worried these new developments would drive people away from the quiet \nlittle inn, the Captains tales brought excitement into the ordinarily calm life \nof the country folks.<PARAGRAPH>His fathers prediction does come true, though in \na different way. Whenever the Captain is asked the rent money for his stay at \nthe inn, he makes it clear that he has no money and has no intention of paying \nit either by any means. Neither does he open his old sea chest ever. Financially, \nthe Captain was not well off. For as long as he stayed at the inn, Jim recalls, \nhe had bought nothing except some stockings from a hawker. And his blue soiled \ncoat is fully covered with patches. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.<PARAGRAPH>Nobody dares challenge the Captain until, one afternoon, Dr. Livesey was visiting \nJims father who had recently become ill. He was waiting to see him, chatting \nwith old Taylor on a new cure for rheumatics. He hears the Captain singing his \nsong. Paying little heed to the song, he continues his conversation, which irritates \nthe Captain who has demanded everyone's silence. Countering the Captains shout \nin the most gentlemanly way, the Doctor makes him aware of the bad effects of \ndrinking and indirectly calls him a scoundrel. Even when the Captain threatens \nhim with a knife, the doctor maintains his composure. Responding to the threat, \nthe doctor makes the Captain aware that he is liable to be punished for disturbing \nthe peace. He concludes with a warning that the Captain will be under constant \nobservation, as he  is also a magistrate. The Captain, for the first \ntime, is defeated.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island05.html"}
