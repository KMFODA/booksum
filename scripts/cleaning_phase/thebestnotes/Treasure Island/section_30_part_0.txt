He tells Jim that theyll stick together at all odds.<PARAGRAPH>The buccaneers stuff themselves with a roasted ox. Silver also joins the \ngang and Jim sees that he, like any other pirate was gorging on the meal. He keeps \non talking about the treasure and their journey back home. All the while Jim cant \ndecide if Silver were on his side or the mutineers. Unlike the pirates, Jim cant \nenjoy his breakfast as all these thoughts were fighting in his mind. He also wonders \nabout his friends.<PARAGRAPH>The treasure hunt begins. Everybody is well armed with \ntheir necessary accessories. Picks, shovels, pistols, food and alcohol. Jim is \ntied around his waist and the loose end of the rope is held by Silver. They follow \nthe map looking for the `tall tree, which Captain Flint had marked. Silver leads \nthem. The men move on all fours when they reach the plateau.<PARAGRAPH>Suddenly \none of the men screams in terror.
