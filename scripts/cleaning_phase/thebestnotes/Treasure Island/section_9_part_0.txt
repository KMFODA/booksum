The anchor is drawn and they set sail.<PARAGRAPH>The voyage to the \nisland had begun. Jim says, the voyage was quite a pleasant one except for a couple \nof incidents. Mr. Arrow turns out to be a complete drunk who had no command on \nthe people under him. Nobody had a clue as to where he got his rum from. With \ntime, he also turned out to be a bad influence among others. One fine morning \nhe disappears, never to be seen again, hardly surprising anybody.<PARAGRAPH>Job \nAnderson, the boatswain takes Arrows position and Mr. Trelawney watched the weather. \nJim observes Silver on the deck. His activities make him a favorite amongst the \nsailors and they call him Barbecue. Israel Hands, a friend of Silver, tell Jim \nthat Silver is no ordinary man. He says that Silver was educated in the best institutions \nand he was also as brave as a lion. Jim takes a liking to him and the feeling \nis mutual. Silver often invites Jim to listen to his parrot Captain Flint. The \nParrot, wherever asked any question, would reply Pieces of eight, Pieces of eight. \nSilver often talked about the bird and the amount of wickedness it has seen in \nits 200 years old long lifetime.<PARAGRAPH>The Squire and the Captain, like at the \nstart of the journey, are always at odds. The Squire often loses control over \nhimself. The weather changes drastically but the ship proves its worth when it \nwithstands the test of nature.

They also have a barrel \nof apples ready for anyone to help himself, though nobody cares for them.<PARAGRAPH>Jim says some good did come of the apple barrel as the Hispaniola approached \nits destination. After sundown when Jim got into the barrel to pick up an apple \nfor himself he finds the whole barrel empty. He fell asleep in the barrel with \nthe calming motion and quiet of the ship. Jim wakes when a man sits down next \nto the barrel. He hears the voice of Silver. His words surprise and terrify him \nand Jim is convinced that the lives of men on board are at risk and depend upon \nhim and him alone.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island14.html"}
