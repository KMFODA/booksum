{"name": "chapter 26", "summary": "Jim learns the basics of sailing from \nIsrael Hands. They settle down to have their meal when Hands tell Jim about jettisoning \nOBriens dead body. Jim tells him that he is not strong enough. Hands tries to \njustify OBriens death as a good thing but Jim refuses to accept his argument. \nHands asks him to fetch him a bottle of wine from the cabin. Jim smells something \nfishy in his request but conceals his apprehension. Jim goes down below the deck \nto get the wine. His suspicion is proved right when Jim, peeping through the fore \ncompanion, finds Hands moving towards the bulwark. Jim realizes that Hands could \nmove and that now he cannot be trusted. Except for one thing -- as they had a \ncommon interest to have the ship land safely.<PARAGRAPH>Jim appears on the deck \nwith a bottle of port wine. After taking a swig, Hands asks Jim to cut him some \ntobacco. Jim does so but tells Hands that cutting peoples throat was a sin and \nhe should atone for his sins like a true Christian. Hands rejects Jims suggestion \nand tells him that he didnt fear dead men. Jim, on the other hand, appreciated \nHands ability to control the ship. He is also excited as he handles the helm.<PARAGRAPH>All of a sudden when Jim turns his head, he sees Hands rushing towards \nhim with a dagger. Hands makes his move and injures himself. Jim takes this opportunity \nto wriggle out of Hands trap and notes that his pistols needs to be primed, so \nthey cannot be fired yet. Both of them indulge in a dodging game when the Hispaniola \nstaggers like never before, taking them by surprise. This gives Jim an upper \nhand. He quickly changes the priming of his pistol. Hands is dumbstruck when Jim \npoints the pistol at him. Jim observes Hands moving his right hand over his shoulder, \nwhile telling Jim that they were fouled by the ship, when something as sharp as \nan arrow strikes Jim in a lightning speed and hits him on his shoulder. It is \nHand's dagger. This startles Jim and he triggers-off his pistols. They drop from \nhis hands. So does Hands who plunges into the sea, head first. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island30.html"}
