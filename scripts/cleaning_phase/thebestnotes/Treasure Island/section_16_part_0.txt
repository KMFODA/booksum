{"name": "chapter 17", "summary": "The last trip, the doctor says, was the most difficult trip as the \nboat was overloaded with five grown men and all of the supplies. The strong water \ncurrents running westward make it much more difficult for them. Sailing with the \nebb, on the other hand, would have taken them to the shore but closer to the area \nwhere Silver and his men had landed.<PARAGRAPH>The doctor is losing hope. Two fresh \noarsmen-the Captain and Redruth are steering the boat. The men keep on suggesting \nideas when suddenly the Captain remembers something. They had completely forgotten \nabout the other guns and the cannon on the Hispaniola, which was now under \nthe control of Silvers men. Looking back, they see the men uncovering the tarpaulin \non the other small boat. Israel Hands is in command of the Hispaniola. \nHe used to be Flints gunner. The lives of Captain and his men are in danger.<PARAGRAPH>In an attempt to save themselves the Captain orders Trelawney to shoot \nHands on the Hispaniola. He misses him, but hits one of the other sailors. \nHearing the shot, the pirates on shore man their small boats and rush towards \nthem. The Squire doesnt give up, but their boat does. The boat goes down and \nall of them are drenched in three feet of water. No one is hurt, but three guns \nout of five were rendered useless. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.<PARAGRAPH>They wade towards the beach, the voices of the pirates nearing them all the time. \nThe thought of Hunter and Joyce handling the mutineers bothers them as they are \nheld in the Stockade. More than half of their goods and provisions are left behind \nin the bottom of the sunken boat.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Treasure_Island/Treasure_Island21.html"}
