The thought of staying alone in the inn, with \na dead body and the danger of the place being ransacked by the Captains old mates \nterrify them both, but they are owed money for the Captain's stay in their Inn. \nSeeking help to protect them from these desperate men, Jim and his mom approach \nthe people from the town to assist them. Much to their dismay, the village folk \nnot only refuse but also discourage them. The mention of the pirate Captain Flint \nbrings fear to those who have heard of him. They relate this within the presence \nof some strange men on the road.<PARAGRAPH>Jims mother jeers at the men of the \nvillage calling them chicken-hearted and decides that she will undertake the task \nherself as-Jim, a now fatherless boy-rightly deserves the money they presumed \nto be kept in the sea chest. A loaded pistol, a bag from Mrs. Crossley, and saddled \nhorses is the only help offered. No one will assist them.<PARAGRAPH>They return \nto the Inn and are relieved to see the door still bolted, Jim and him mother enter \nthe inn. He discovers the \"black spot\" when he finds a small piece of \npaper with a short message.

Soon she \nrealizes that this is a mammoth task as the coins are from different countries. \nJim is terrified when he hears the tapping sound of the blind beggar's walking \nstick approaching and asks his mother to quickly grab the entire bag.
