{"name": "chapter 9", "summary": "They board the Hispaniola. \nJim observes that Mr. Arrow  and Squire Trelawney have a good rapport. \nBut it isnt the same with the Squire and the Captain-Captain Smollet. Smollet \nasks to speak with the Squire prior to the voyage. Smollet expresses his dissatisfaction \nwithout mincing words. He clearly tells the Squire that he doesnt like the planned \nvoyage, the crew and his officer. Trelawney is offended at this.<PARAGRAPH>Dr. Livesey, \nunderstanding the gravity of the situation butts in and inquires the reasons for \nthe Captains dissatisfaction. The Captain tells the doctor that he is not fully \ninformed about the objective of such a voyage and finds his crew members more \nknowledgeable in this matter. He goes on to say that he should have been the one \nto choose his sailors and makes a comment on how a senior officer should conduct \nhimself in front of his juniors. He points out that the powder and arms should \nbe secured in the fore hold where there is enough space under the cabin and that \nthey should provide baths to their people inside the cabin, rather than outside.<PARAGRAPH>His last point leaves everybody speechless as he states that he has heard \nthat they have a map of an island with the exact latitude and longitude and an \nX marking the location of treasure on the island exactly. Although the Squire \nprotests that he hasnt let out the secret, nobody plays any attention to him. \nThe Squire questions the Captain as to whether he fears a mutiny, but the Captain \ninsists he does not. He just warns about taking precautions to secure the weapons \nin an area under the control of people that can be trusted.<PARAGRAPH>He asks the \nSquire and the doctor to keep the secret of the map from him as well as Mrs. Arrow \nas he feels that the things are not right on board.<PARAGRAPH>Much to the surprise \nof Captain Smollet, Dr. Livesey and the Squire accepts his suggestions. Even though \nthe Squire finds him unmanly and un-English.<PARAGRAPH>Based on the Captains suggestion \nchanges are made much to his liking and he agrees to serve as Captain. When Long \nJohn Silver inquires about the new arrangements, Captain Smollet orders him to \nget down to doing his work in the kitchen. The Captain also asks Dr. Livesey to \nremain easy with the men.
