He tells Dr. Manette that he \nunderstands the closeness between the two of them and would never want to separate father and daughter.

He promises that if Lucie ever declares her love for Darnay, he will approve their marriage.<PARAGRAPH>Darnay attempts to tell the Doctor his real name and the reason for his being in England, but the doctor refuses to listen. \nInstead, he makes Darnay promise to reveal his secret on the morning of his wedding if he is to marry Lucie.<PARAGRAPH>On returning home later that evening, Lucie finds her father in a great state \n        of agitation and finds him back on his shoemaker's bench.
