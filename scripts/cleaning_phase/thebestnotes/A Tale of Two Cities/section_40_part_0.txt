{"name": "chapter eleven: dusk", "summary": "Lucie is completely shocked by the guilty verdict; but she nobly lifts herself out of her stupor because she knows she has \nto stand by Darnay in his misery rather than augment it. She pleads with his jailer to let her embrace her husband for the \nlast time. Barsad allows her to do so. Darnay blesses his wife and assures her that they will meet again one day. He also \nsends a parting blessing to little Lucie. As the couple tear themselves apart, Lucie tearfully informs her husband that they \nwill not be parted for long as she is sure to die of a broken heart. Darnay prevents the Doctor from kneeling before him \nand comforts him. He realizes now the full extent of the struggle the Doctor has endured. He is also grateful for his \nefforts to release him. The Doctor's only response is to run his hands through his hair and utter an anguished cry. After \nDarnay is led out, Lucie collapses at her father's feet.<PARAGRAPH>Carton, who has unobtrusively observed this scene, comes forward and carries \n        the senseless woman to the coach. On reaching the house, Carton carries \n        her again and lays her on the couch. Little Lucie and Miss Pross weep \n        over her. Carton does not want Lucie to be revived. It would be better \n        for her to sleep through her misery. Little Lucie is overjoyed to see \n        Carton and knows that he will do something to help her mother and save \n        her father. He promises her that she will again see her father. He kisses \n        Lucie and whispers in her ear, \"A life you love.\" This is overheard \n        by little Lucie. He urges Dr. Manette to use his influence, once again, \n        to save Darnay's life, even though he knows that it is hopeless. He explains \n        to Mr. Lorry that he encouraged Dr. Manette only because it might console \n        Lucie one day. Carton then leaves.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide27.html"}
