{"name": "chapter one: the period", "summary": "In the opening chapter, the period in which the novel is set is described. The story begins about fifteen years before the \nFrench Revolution. It is a time when many people think they live in the best of times, while others condemn it as the \nworst of times. The kings of England and France are both mediocre rulers, and they believe in their divine rights. People \nare put to death for the slightest of crimes.<PARAGRAPH>The condition in France is very bad, for there is a total disregard for the \n        common people by the aristocracy; injustice, cruelty, and oppression are \n        rampant. The aristocracy is unaware that the masses are preparing for \n        the revolution by turning timber into guillotines and farm carts into \n        tumbrels to convey people to the guillotine. In England, too, lawlessness \n        and poverty prevail. Even the colonies in America are up in arms against \n        their English rulers, and the attempts of the American colonies to obtain \n        freedom are not taken seriously.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide06.html"}
