{"name": "chapter twenty: a plea", "summary": "Carton drops in to see the newlyweds as soon as they get back from their honeymoon. \n        His habits, manner, and looks have not changed. He tells Darnay that he \n        wishes they were friends and apologizes for the remarks he had made after \n        the trial when he was drunk. Darnay assures him that he has forgotten \n        all about it, especially since Carton had saved his life. Carton then \n        solicits permission to visit them occasionally. Darnay grants him his \n        request. After Carton leaves, Darnay speaks unkindly of him to the others. \n        Later on, while they are preparing for bed, Lucie tells Darnay to be more \n        considerate towards Carton. She feels that Carton is a deeper person with \n        a bigger heart than he shows himself to be.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide20.html"}
