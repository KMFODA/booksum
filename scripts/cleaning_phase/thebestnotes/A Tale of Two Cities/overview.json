{"name": "overview", "summary": "In 1775, Mr. Jarvis Lorry, an official of Tellson's Bank in London, accompanies Lucie Manette to Paris. He has \ninformation that her father, Dr. Alexandre Manette, who had disappeared eighteen years ago, is alive. He had been \nwrongfully imprisoned in the Bastille and left there to die. Lucie is shaken when she learns that her father is still living. \nOn reaching Paris, they go to the house of Monsieur Defarge, a wine-seller. He had been Dr. Manette's servant and has \ntaken care of him after his release from prison. Both Mr. Lorry and Lucie are shocked to see the terrible state Doctor \nManette is in. He has aged prematurely, having lost both his memory and his sense. He spends his time cobbling shoes. \nThe revolutionary ardor and hatred against oppression are fanned every time Defarge and his associates look at this wreck \nof a man, who has been a victim of the aristocracy. Mr. Lorry and Lucie take her father back to London. With love and \ncompassion, Lucie plans to nurse her father back to health and sanity.<PARAGRAPH>Five years later, in 1780, a young Frenchman, named Charles Darnay, is accused of being a traitor and a spy. Lucie and \nher father are reluctant witnesses for the prosecution, as they had met him while travelling from Calais to Dover. Lucie \nstresses the good qualities of the accused while imparting her testimony. The evidence against him is overwhelming as \nthe prosecution produces a number of witnesses who swear that he is a spy. The onlookers, too, mentally condemn him \nand are waiting for the death sentence to be pronounced. However, it is Sydney Carton, an advocate present in the \ncourtroom, who points out the resemblance between the prisoner and himself to the defense lawyer Mr. Stryver. The jury \nthus realizes that it could be a case of mistaken identity, and Darnay is acquitted.<PARAGRAPH>Years pass, and both Darnay and Carton fall in love with Lucie Manette. Carton is a lawyer who wastes his life in \ndrinking and idling. Lucie has no interest in him; instead, she marries Darnay. He is a French aristocrat who has \nrenounced his inheritance and now lives in London under an assumed name and works as a tutor. His uncle, the Marquis \nSt. Evremonde, is a notorious man renowned for his cruelty and callousness; he has lived the life of a profligate and has \nno respect for human life. This is emphasized in two incidents that take place while he drives home from a royal \nreception. He kills a child on the streets and refuses to help a poor widow in need of a tombstone to mark her husband's \ngrave. That very night he is murdered in bed.<PARAGRAPH>The French Revolution breaks out in all its fury with the storming of the Bastille. In London, Darnay has been happily \nmarried to Lucie for eleven years, and they have a beautiful daughter. On hearing that Gabelle, his steward in France, has \nbeen erroneously arrested, Darnay secretly returns to Paris to save his faithful servant. He is caught and imprisoned. On \nhearing of her husband's capture, Lucie, her daughter, Dr. Manette, and Mr. Lorry rush to Paris to save him. Dr. Manette, \nhimself a victim of oppression, convinces the people of his son-in-law's innocence, and Darnay is discharged. Madame \nDefarge, however, seeks personal revenge against the Evremonde family, for the cruel Marquis had molested her sister \nand killed her brother. Largely because of her, Darnay is re-arrested, tried, and sentenced to death. There is no hope of \nsaving him. Even the lives of Lucie and her daughter are in danger as the hard-core revolutionaries, like the Defarges, \nwould like to eliminate anyone who has a connection with aristocracy.<PARAGRAPH>The story ends dramatically when Sydney Carton decides to save Darnay's life \n        by taking his place. He gains entry into the prison, drugs Darnay, and \n        with the help of Mr. Lorry gets him out of danger. The Darnay family flees \n        back to England while Carton sacrifices his life for Darnay, his look-alike. \n        The sacrifice is made to fulfill a promise to Lucie whom he loves. Carton \n        feels noble about his action and knows that he will live in the hearts \n        of the Darnays forever.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide04.html"}
