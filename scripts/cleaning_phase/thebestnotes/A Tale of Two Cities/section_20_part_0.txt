{"name": "chapter fifteen: knitting", "summary": "Two men enter the wine shop in St. Antoine. One is Monsieur Defarge; the other is the road-mender who had been \nquestioned by the Marquis about the tall, thin man hanging from under his carriage. As they enter, one man drinks up his \nwine and departs; a second man does the same and is followed by a third. The road mender eats the coarse bread and wine \noffered to him by Defarge. They then make their way to the garret where Dr. Manette had once lived. The three men who \nhad earlier left the wine shop are present. Defarge introduces the three men as Jacques One, Two, and Three. He \nintroduces himself as Jacques Four and the road-mender as Jacques Five.<PARAGRAPH>The road-mender relates how he had seen Gaspard hanging from under the carriage of the Marquis; he tells how Gaspard \nremained hidden for a year but is finally caught. The soldiers took him to a prison on top of a hill near the village. There \nwere rumors circulating that Gaspard would be pardoned; other rumors suggested that he would be held prisoner and \ntortured for a long time. In truth, Gaspard was hanged, forty feet high, near the fountain in the center of the peasant \nvillage.<PARAGRAPH>The road-mender departs, leaving the others in gloomy silence; their faces show their desire to seek revenge. They decide \nto exterminate the entire Evremonde family; their names will go into the \"register.\" Defarge assures the three Jacques that \nthere will be no mistake in deciphering the register, for Madame Defarge has knitted, using her own symbols, the names \nof every aristocrat that is to perish. No one would be able to erase even one letter from her knitting.<PARAGRAPH>The road-mender is later taken to Versailles to cheer the lords and their \n        ladies. Defarge feels that the cheering will make the aristocrats more \n        arrogant, which in turn would result in their bringing about their own \n        downfall in a rapid manner. Defarge also trusts that when the road-mender \n        sees the opulence of Versailles, he will thirst for the blood of the aristocracy.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide17.html"}
