{"name": "chapter sixteen: still knitting", "summary": "Defarge informs his wife that another spy has been assigned to watch the neighborhood. His name is John Barsad, the \nman who had testified against Darnay in England. Defarge describes him as a man of forty, five feet nine inches tall, with \nblack hair, a dark complexion, dark eyes, a thin, long, sallow face, and a crooked, aquiline nose that gives him a sinister \nexpression. Madame Defarge remarks that she will add his name to the register. Defarge complains about the slow \nprogression of the revolution. His wife replies that vengeance and retribution take a long time; she assures him, however, \nthat the revolution will occur.<PARAGRAPH>The next day at noon Madame Defarge sits knitting at her usual spot in the wine shop when a stranger walks in. On \nseeing him, she picks up a rose from the counter and pins it to her cap. When she does this, the customers stop talking. \nShe recognizes him as the spy John Barsad. He greets Madame Defarge and ironically compliments her on her knitting \nstyle, saying the pattern is pretty. He asks her what her knitting is for; she replies that it is just a pastime, but maybe \nsomeday she will find a use for it.<PARAGRAPH>During their conversation, a few men enter the shop, but on seeing the rose they look around and leave promptly. Also all \nthe customers that were already in the shop have now departed. As they talk, Madame Defarge knits Barsads name into \nthe register. He tries in vain to extract information from her and even mentions Gaspard's execution. Madame Defarge \nstoically shows no reaction.<PARAGRAPH>Defarge enters the shop, and the spy greets him as Jacques. Defarge corrects \n        him by calmly informing him that his name is Ernest. Barsad tries to gather \n        information from him as well, but to no avail. He then taunts Defarge \n        by telling him that Lucie Manette is going to marry Charles Darnay, who \n        is the son of Madame DAulnais and the nephew of Evremonde. Madame Defarge \n        shows no reaction to this information, but her husband does. Barsad notices \n        Defarges response and is pleased to have made an impact. Satisfied with \n        his work, Barsad pays for his wine and leaves. After the spy is gone, \n        Defarge wonders out loud if this information could possibly be true; Madame \n        Defarge thinks it may be. Defarge, saddened by the information, hopes \n        that Darnay does not come to France. Meanwhile, Madame Defarge knits Darnay's \n        name in her register. At the end of the chapter, she takes off the rose, \n        and customers re-enter the shop.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide18.html"}
