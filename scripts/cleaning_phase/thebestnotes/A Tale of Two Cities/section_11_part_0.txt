{"name": "chapter six: hundreds of people", "summary": "Dr. Manette lives on a quiet street corner near Soho square. One Sunday, four months after Darnays trial Mr. Lorry goes to dine with \nhim. The doctor, restored to health and sanity, now earns good money by treating patients and conducting ingenious experiments. \nMr. Lorry observes that the Doctor has the shoemaker's bench and tray of tools. He wonders aloud why the Doctor would want to \nkeep such a painful reminder. He is interrupted by Miss Pross, the nurse, who feels that it is perfectly fine for him to do so.<PARAGRAPH>Miss Pross is upset because hundreds of suitors come to visit Lucie every day. She is a very jealous woman, prone to exaggeration. \nShe is also absolutely and selflessly devoted to Lucie Manette. When Mr. Darnay arrives after lunch, Miss Pross is visibly upset and \ngoes into the house. The Manettes, however, receive him warmly. Darnay tells them a story he had heard while he was imprisoned in \nthe Tower of London. Some workmen had apparently come upon an old dungeon, unused for a long time, with names of prisoners \ncarved upon the walls. Upon digging below a corner stone, on which some unfortunate prisoner had carved the word dig, they found \nthe ashes of a paper along with the ashes of a leather bag.<PARAGRAPH>All this talk of dungeons and prisoners unnerves Dr. Manette. It starts to \n        rain, and they go indoors from the courtyard. Inside, Miss Pross, who \n        is still upset, serves tea, just as Mr. Carton walks in. He keeps to himself \n        and appears moody. Lucie, while looking out of the window, gets a premonition \n        that the footsteps outside the house signify people who are going to enter \n        their lives someday. Mr. Carton adds his own premonition by remarking \n        that he too sees a huge crowd coming toward the whole group in a menacing \n        way.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide13.html"}
