{"name": "chapter six: triumph", "summary": "Darnay is brought in front of the dreaded Tribunal. Looking at the jury and the onlookers, he feels as though the usual \norder has been reversed and that now the felons are trying the honest men. The men in the courtroom are armed with \nvarious weapons while the women are wearing knives and knitting. Darnay notices Defarge and his wife; she has a spare \npiece of knitting under her arm and whispers into Defarge's ear.<PARAGRAPH>At first, the onlookers seem hostile towards Darnay, but they respond favorably \n        when they hear that he is married to Dr. Manette's daughter. They are \n        sympathetic to the Doctor and appreciate the work he does. Because of \n        this, their attitude towards Darnay changes from hostility to sympathy. \n        With Dr. Manette's testimony, Gabelle's letter as evidence, and the sympathy \n        of the crowd, Darnay is released. As he leaves, the crowd follows him. \n        They are jubilant, rejoicing, and dancing the Carmagnole; they lift Darnay \n        up and carry him home. Along the way, Darnay looks for the Defarges, but \n        they are nowhere to be seen. At first, he is a bit apprehensive about \n        what is happening and imagines himself to be heading toward the guillotine. \n        This feeling soon passes. Once he reaches home he hugs everyone, kisses \n        his wife, and carries her upstairs.
