By speaking in the third person, \nMr. Lorry informs the Doctor of his nine day relapse and that his daughter has not been told of this. He also tries to find \nout how this relapse occurred and if it will ever happen again. The Doctor assures him that this is not likely to happen \nagain. He tells Mr. Lorry that the relapse occurs due to a painful recollection, which is alleviated by cobbling. In prison, \nthe Doctor had taken up cobbling as a means of occupying himself and as a means of forgetting his mental anguish.<PARAGRAPH>The Doctor agrees to hand over his bench, cobbling tools, and material. The \n        doctor then leaves for a vacation in Wales, where he will join Darnay \n        and Lucie. During his absence, Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross chop the bench \n        into little bits and use it as firewood. They bury the tools, shoes, and \n        leather in the garden.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025221/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Dickens/A_Tale_Of_Two_Cities_Study_Guide19.html"}
