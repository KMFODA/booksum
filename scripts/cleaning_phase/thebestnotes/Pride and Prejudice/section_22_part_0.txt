{"name": "chapter 25", "summary": "Mrs. Bennets brother and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, come to spend Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner is a \nsensible, gentlemanly person, and his wife is an amiable, elegant woman who is very fond of her nieces, especially the \nelder two. Mrs. Bennet airs her grievances to her sister-in-law, stating her distress over her failure to get Jane and \nElizabeth engaged or married. Mrs. Gardiner suggests a change of scene for Jane to help get over her disappointment \nover Bingley. It is decided that Jane will return to London with her uncle and aunt.<PARAGRAPH>While the Gardiners spend the week at Longbourn, there are frequent visitors; Wickham is the most regular one. Mrs. \nGardiner views with suspicion Elizabeths attraction to Wickham. Mrs. Gardiner has spent a considerable time in \nDerbyshire and knows the area from where Wickham comes. They have mutual acquaintances there, and Wickham is \nable to update her with information.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. Gardiner talks of the Darcy family. She has seen Pemberley, the Darcy \n        estate, which is very impressive. She also speaks very highly of the late \n        Mr. Darcy. She has a vague recollection that his son, Fitzwilliam Darcy, \n        is a very proud, ill-natured young man. This reconfirms Elizabeths opinion \n        of him.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide15.html"}
