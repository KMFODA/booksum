{"name": "chapter 1", "summary": "The novel opens with an ironic statement about marriage, which is the axis \n        around which the world of Longbourn turns: \"It is a truth universally \n        acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be \n        in want of a wife\". Presently everyone in Longbourn, Hertfordshire, \n        is excited about the fact that Mr. Bingley, an unmarried, rich young man, \n        is to settle at Netherfield Park, a fine estate nearby. Mrs. Bennets \n        excitement is extraordinary, for she has five daughters that she wants \n        to have married, especially the older ones. Her mind is fired with matrimonial \n        speculations, and she tries to persuade her husband to pay a visit to \n        Mr. Bingley as soon as he arrives. Mr. Bennet pokes fun at his wifes \n        impetuosity and jokes that he will give the newcomer a carte blanche so \n        that he can marry any one of their daughters, including the little Lizzy. \n        Mrs. Bennet is nettled and accuses her husband of having no compassion \n        for her poor nerves.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide06.html"}
