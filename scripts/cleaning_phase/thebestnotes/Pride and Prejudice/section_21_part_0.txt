{"name": "chapter 24", "summary": "Miss Bingleys reply to Janes letter arrives and indicates that they are all settled in London for the winter. Most of the \nletter cruelly speaks of Miss Darcy and her many attractions. Caroline also boasts about the growing intimacy between \nher and her brother Bingley, who is residing with Darcy. Elizabeth still feels that Bingley is being influenced by his \nsisters, who want to destroy his admiration for Jane. She criticizes Bingley for being so easily swayed and \nmanipulated, but Jane will not listen to any criticism of Bingley, Caroline, or Mrs. Hurst.<PARAGRAPH>After the arrival of Carolines letter, the mood at Longbourn is somber. Mr. \n        Wickhams frequent visits seem to alleviate some of the gloom. The entire \n        Bennet family is told about Darcys alleged treatment of Wickham, and \n        everyone accepts his account as factual. Even Jane condemns Darcy; but \n        she still believes there may be extenuating circumstances that are unknown \n        to them.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide14.html"}
