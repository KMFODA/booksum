{"name": "chapter 41", "summary": "There is an omnipresent gloom over Hertfordshire as the regiments stay in Meryton is coming to an end. Kitty and \nLydia are wretched, and their mother shares their grief. Elizabeth is ashamed of their behavior and realizes again the \ntruth of Darcys denunciations.<PARAGRAPH>Elizabeth is worried about Lydias trip to Brighton with Mr. Foster; she is afraid that Lydia will behave in an \nunguarded, flippant, flirtatious, and wayward manner, damaging her reputation and the reputation of the Bennet family. \nElizabeth, therefore, strongly advises her father not to allow Lydia to go; but her pleas fall on deaf ears.<PARAGRAPH>On the regiments last day in Meryton, Wickham and some other officers dine \n        at Longbourn. Elizabeth tells Wickham that she has visited with Darcy \n        and Fitzwilliam, which seems to alarm Wickham. He is also baffled by Elizabeths \n        sudden reversal of opinion about Darcy and says that Darcy is always on \n        his best behavior when he is staying with his aunt, Lady Catherine, whom \n        he fears.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide20.html"}
