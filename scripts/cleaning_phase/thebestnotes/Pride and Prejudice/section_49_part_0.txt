{"name": "chapter 58", "summary": "Darcy returns from London and visits Longbourn. When Elizabeth thanks him \n        for his kind intervention in Lydia's affair, Darcy blushes because he \n        had not expected that Mrs. Gardiner would tell Elizabeth about his part \n        in the marriage. Darcy then proposes to Elizabeth again. This time Elizabeth \n        happily accepts his proposal. As they talk over their past relationship, \n        many misunderstandings are cleared. Darcy humbly informs Elizabeth that \n        he has apologized to Bingley for his former rash advice about Jane and \n        assured his friend that Jane truly loves him.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide25.html"}
