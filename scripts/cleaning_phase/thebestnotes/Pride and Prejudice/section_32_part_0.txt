{"name": "chapter 35", "summary": "The next morning Elizabeth is walking by the park gates when she is confronted by Darcy, who thrusts a letter in her \nhand and leaves. The letter, contrary to her expectations, does not renew his marriage proposal. Instead, Darcy admits \nthat he persuaded Bingley to give up Jane, for he had the impression that Jane did not really love Bingley. Darcy now \nrealizes his mistake; however, he still feels the Bennet family, especially the mother, is ill suited to become the in-laws \nof a man of Bingleys caliber. Darcy also apologizes for keeping Janes presence in London a secret from Bingley.<PARAGRAPH>In regard to Wickham, Darcy informs Elizabeth that his own father, who employed \n        Wickhams dad, had given Wickham 3,000 to aid him in studying law. Unfortunately, \n        Wickham squandered the money in idle living; quickly exhausting the funds, \n        Wickham demanded more money. When rebuffed by Darcy, Wickham tried to \n        get back at Darcy by attempting to elope with Darcys young sister, which \n        Darcy was able to foil. Darcy ends the letter by asserting the veracity \n        of his statements, which Colonel Fitzwilliam can certify. Darcy closes \n        the letter with \"God bless you.\"", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide18.html"}
