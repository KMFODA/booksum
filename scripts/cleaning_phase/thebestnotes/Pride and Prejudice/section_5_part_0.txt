{"name": "chapter 6", "summary": "The ladies of Longbourn and those of Netherfield exchange visits. Jane Bennet's immaculate manners and cheerful \ndisposition please Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, but they do not care much about her family. It is quite obvious to \nElizabeth that Jane is succumbing to Mr. Bingley's charms although she is inclined to think that \"her uniform \ncheerfulness of manner\" is a foolproof camouflage to hide her true feelings about anything. Elizabeth confides this fact \nto her friend Charlotte.<PARAGRAPH>While Elizabeth is preoccupied with Bingley's attention to her sister Jane, she does not realize that she herself is \nbecoming the focal point of Darcy's attention. Darcy, who had earlier written off Elizabeth as a 'tolerable' maiden, \nlater realizes that she has lovely eyes and a fine figure. He wishes to know her better and tries to listen in on her \nconversations with others.<PARAGRAPH>At a party, Elizabeth is goaded to play the piano and sing. She readily obliges \n        and charms the audience by her performance. She is followed at the piano \n        by her sister Mary, who is most eager to showcase her talent. Darcy stands \n        aloof, wrapped in his thoughts. Suddenly, Sir William Lucas draws him \n        into a conversation. Lucas stumps him by suggesting aloud that he must \n        dance with Elizabeth. Darcy beseeches her to dance with him, but Elizabeth \n        spurns him in retribution for his earlier refusal to dance with her. As \n        Darcy stands apart and thinks about Elizabeth, Miss Bingley approaches \n        and asks what he is thinking. He blatantly replies that the subject of \n        his musings is Elizabeth Bennet. Miss Bingley is stupefied and teases \n        him about the probability of having Mrs. Bennet for a mother-in-law.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide08.html"}
