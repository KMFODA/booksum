{"name": "chapter 49", "summary": "Lydia and Wickham are found and, as expected, they are not married. Wickham, \n        however, has agreed to marry her on the stipulation that his debts are \n        cleared and he is given a stipend of one hundred pounds a year. Mr. Bennet \n        agrees to the offer, but suspects that a much greater amount must have \n        been passed on by Mr. Gardiner to maneuver Wickham to yield. Mrs. Bennet, \n        upon hearing that Lydia is to be married, forgets the disgraceful state \n        of affairs under which the marriage is coming to a pass. She enthusiastically \n        proceeds to make arrangements for a wedding and to convey the glad tidings \n        in the neighborhood.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide22.html"}
