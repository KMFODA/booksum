{"name": "chapter 2", "summary": "Mr. Bennet is one of the first callers on Mr. Bingley, and he withholds this \n        information merely to vex his wife. Still in the dark about her husbands \n        visit, Mrs. Bennet seems ludicrously desperate to have her husband call \n        on the new neighbor, and her husbands incessant talk about Mr. Bingley \n        seems to rub salt over her wounds. As Mrs. Bennet grows more impatient \n        and irritated with her husband, he casually informs his wife and daughters \n        about his visit. They are all astonished at his promptness, and Mrs. Bennet \n        is full of praise for him. She remarks that he is an \"excellent father.\" \n        Mr. Bennet, disgusted with his wifes outburst, leaves the room to take \n        refuge in his study.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide06.html"}
