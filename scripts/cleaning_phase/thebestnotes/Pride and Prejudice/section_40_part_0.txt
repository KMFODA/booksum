Mrs. Bennet, in hysterics, blames everyone for her suffering. She is still blind to the fact that her over-indulgence \nwith Lydia is the principal cause of her daughters disgrace. To add to the misery at the Bennets, Lady Lucas calls to \nconsole them, when in reality she has come to gloat.<PARAGRAPH>Lydia writes a letter to Mrs. Forster and says that she and Wickham are going \n        to Gretna Green. Jane and Elizabeth read the letter and share its contents. \n        Mr. Gardiner plans join Mr. Bennet to help in the search for Lydia.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide22.html"}
