{"name": "chapter 15", "summary": "As a rector, Mr. Collins has a sufficient income and a good house. He visits Longbourn with the purpose of choosing \none of the Bennet girls as a wife, \"if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common \nreport\". Janes lovely face attracts him, and she seems to be his \"settled choice\". Mrs. Bennet, however, makes it clear \nthat Janes affections are pledged elsewhere. Mr. Collins then turns his attention to Elizabeth.<PARAGRAPH>The sisters walk into Meryton, accompanied by Mr. Collins. They meet Mr. Denny, \n        an officer, who introduces them to his colleague Mr. Wickham. He is a \n        young man with a fine countenance and a good figure. The group encounters \n        Bingley and Darcy, who are riding down the street on their way to Longbourn \n        to inquire after Janes health. Darcy and Wickham seem flustered on seeing \n        each other, exchanging a strange look. Darcy and Bingley ride on while \n        Denny and Wickham escort the girls and Mr. Collins to Mrs. Philips house. \n        Mrs. Philips promises to invite Wickham and the girls to dinner the next \n        evening, which thrills the girls. On returning to Longbourn, Mr. Collins \n        lavishes exaggerated praise on Mrs. Philips excellent manners and hospitality.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide11.html"}
