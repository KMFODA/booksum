{"name": "chapter 29", "summary": "Mr. Collins is ecstatic over the invitation to Rosings, for he wants to display \"the grandeur of his patroness to his \nwandering visitors\" and to show \"her civility towards himself and his wife.\" He spends hours instructing the guests on \nwhat they are to expect and how they are to behave at Lady Catherines.<PARAGRAPH>The company arrives at Rosings. They are greeted by Lady Catherine with an air of condescension designed \"not to \nmake her visitors forget their inferior rank.\" Lady Catherine is a tall, large woman who speaks in an authoritative tone. \nHer daughter is a sickly, diminutive creature who speaks in a muffled voice, but only to Mrs. Jenkinson, who fusses \nover her comforts.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Collins raves about the delicious and exotic dinner; Lady Catherine seems \n        gratified from this overdose of praise. After dinner, Lady Catherine advises \n        Charlotte on how to manage her house, her cows, and her poultry. Elizabeth \n        is shocked at how the woman delights in dictating to others. She is also \n        shocked by Lady Catherines many personal questions to her about her family; \n        Elizabeth considers them interfering and impertinent and answers in a \n        manner that surprises the smug Lady Catherine. After several games of \n        cards, Lady Catherine indicates that the evening is over. Mr. Collins \n        is eager to know Elizabeths opinion about Lady Catherine and Rosings. \n        For Charlottes sake, she says the evening and the hostess have been pleasant.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide16.html"}
