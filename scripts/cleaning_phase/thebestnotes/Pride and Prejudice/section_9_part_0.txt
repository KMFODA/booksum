{"name": "chapter 10", "summary": "Jane feels a little better by evening, so Elizabeth again joins the party in the drawing-room. Darcy is trying to write a \nletter to his sister, but Miss Bingley repeatedly interrupts him by calling out messages from her to include in his letter \nto his sister. When Darcy finally finishes the letter, he turns his attention to the conversation in the room. He notices \nthat Elizabeth talks animatedly on every subject and is impressed by her sharp observations and succinct way of \nwording ideas. Darcy is also magnetically drawn towards Elizabeths fine eyes. Elizabeth notices that he frequently \nstares at her.<PARAGRAPH>Darcy asks Elizabeth to dance with him, but she flatly refuses, much to the relief of Miss Bingley, who has been \njealously watching the two of them. Darcy does not feel thwarted by her refusal; instead, he is so bewitched by \nElizabeths unconventional charms that he feels that had it not been for the inferiority of her connections, he would \nhave been in danger of falling in love with her.<PARAGRAPH>The following morning Jane is feeling much better. Elizabeth goes for a stroll \n        in the garden with Mrs. Hurst. They come upon Darcy and Miss Bingley in \n        the garden. The path on which they are walking is spacious enough for \n        three people only, so Elizabeth is rudely left behind by the two sisters \n        to walk by herself. Darcy is annoyed at how Elizabeth is treated.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide10.html"}
