{"name": "chapter 2", "summary": "A small number of \nwhite men, who call themselves Sour-doughs, live in Fort Yukon. They make their \nbread with sourdough starter, instead of baking powder or yeast. These men enjoy \nthe sight of the newcomers dogs being mangled to death by White Fang and the \nother dogs. One man in particular, Beauty Smith, enjoys the fighting. He works \nfor the people at the fort and has his eye on White Fang. He offers to buy White \nFang from Gray Beaver, who is at first not willing. Beauty Smith then tempts Gray \nBeaver with liquor until he is addicted. Gray Beaver is then willing to sell White \nFang for a few bottles of whiskey.<PARAGRAPH>Gray Beaver hands White Fang over to \nBeauty, but he escapes three times from captivity and returns to Gray Beaver, \nonly to be betrayed and returned each time. Upon his return, he is beaten by Beauty \nfor his disobedience. Finally, Gray Beaver, sober and bankrupt, leaves for the \nMackenzie River, and White Fang cannot follow since he is tied with a chain. After \none especially severe beating from Beauty, White Fang falls sick.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang20.html"}
