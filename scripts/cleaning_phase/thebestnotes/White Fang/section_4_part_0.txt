{"name": "chapter 2", "summary": "The she-wolf and One Eye hang about \nthe Indian camp for two days until a bullet is fired into the forest and they \nare forced to leave. She finally finds a good place to have her cubs. It is a \nsmall cave above a stream that flows into the Mackenzie in the summer; the stream \nis now frozen. The she-wolf settles into the cave while One Eye keeps watch at \nthe entrance. Hungry, he goes hunting and stays out for eight hours without any \nsuccess. He returns to find a litter of cubs, which the she-wolf is carefully \nguarding, for fear that One Eye will devour them. One Eye, instead, feels a strong \npaternal instinct. He goes hunting again and catches a ptarmigan ; he \ndoes not eat it, but saves it for his family. Then he comes across a porcupine \nthat has been injured by a lynx. He eats the ptarmigan and carries the porcupine \nhome to a warm reception by the she-wolf.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang11.html"}
