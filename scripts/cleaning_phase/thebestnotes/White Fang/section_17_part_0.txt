{"name": "chapter 4", "summary": "The chapter paints \nin great detail the fight between Cherokee, a bulldog owned by Tim Keenan, and \nWhite Fang. Neither is accustomed to fighting the type of dog he now faces, but \nboth are good fighters. The crowd is with Cherokee, and White Fang does give in \na couple of times, only to be enraged by Smith, who laughs and points at him. \nDuring the battle, White Fang is very badly mauled. Weedon Scott, a well-respected \nmining expert, enters the ring and tries to save White Fang. Threatening to turn \nSmith in to the authorities, Scott buys White Fang for three hundred dollars. \nScotts assistant, Matt, helps him to separate the two dogs. Scott wrenches the \njaws of the bull dog open with a revolver while Matt lifts White Fang out of the \nring.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang21.html"}
