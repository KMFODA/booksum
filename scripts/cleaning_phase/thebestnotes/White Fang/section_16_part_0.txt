{"name": "chapter 3", "summary": "White Fang is kept chained in a \npen at the rear of the Fort, where Beauty provokes him and laughs at him, hoping \nto make White Fang even meaner. He is often removed from the pen and made to fight \nother dogs, including mastiffs, wolves, and huskies. White Fang invariably wins, \nno matter what kind of dog he faces. Sometimes he has to fight three dogs at once \nor a freshly caught wolf from the Wild. White Fangs constant victories make him \na public figure. He is known as the Fighting wolf, and he is on exhibit in his \ncage all the time.<PARAGRAPH>Beauty Smith begins to make money at White Fangs expense. \nWhenever a fight is arranged, bets are taken. To make certain that White Fang \nwins, Beauty trains him in the wild. He releases him a few miles from town, usually \nat night to avoid police interference, and he must fight for survival. Back in \ncaptivity, White Fang is forced to fight wolves that have been trapped by Indians, \nfor he has defeated all the available dogs. One time he fights a full-grown female \nlynx and defeats her.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang20.html"}
