{"name": "chapter 6", "summary": "Although Scott repeatedly \ntries to gain White Fang's confidence by speaking kind words and patting him gently, \nWhite Fang remains wary of him. Gradually, White Fang begins to accept Scott's \nspoken affection, but he still refuses to be touched or fed by the man. To build \ntrust, Scott throws the pieces of meat, one by one, each landing closer. Cautiously, \nWhite Fang retrieves each piece until he is willing to eat from Scott's hand. \nMatt is highly surprised at the sight of Scott petting the wolf-dog, whose usual \nresponse is to snarl and leap backwards. As Scott continues to pet him, White \nFang begins to enjoy the affection. He begins to protect Scott, guarding his property \nand leaping on any nighttime visitors. Soon White Fang learns to distinguish between \nfootsteps so that he can tell the difference between thieves and honest men.<PARAGRAPH>White \nFang easily proves his superiority to Scott's other dogs, who accept his leadership. \nHe willingly returns to the dog team and becomes the leader of the Klondike sled \nrunners, where he works in single file, on double traces.<PARAGRAPH>In late spring, \nScott is called away, and White Fang refuses to eat, drink, or sleep. He becomes \nweak and lets the other dogs harass him. Matt writes Scott a letter informing \nhim of White Fang's condition. As a result, Scott returns, and White Fang regains \nhis health.<PARAGRAPH>One night as Matt and Scott are busy playing cribbage, White \nFang nabs Beauty Smith in the dark. Apparently, the despicable man has come to \nsteal White Fang, for he has a club and a steel chain with him.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang22.html"}
