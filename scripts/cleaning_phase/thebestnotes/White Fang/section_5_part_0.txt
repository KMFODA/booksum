{"name": "chapter 3", "summary": "Aptly titled The Gray Cub, the chapter is devoted to describing one \nof the litter of five, comprised of two females and three males. The gray, male \ncub is the most striking of the new wolves. His coat is gray, like that of a true \nwolf, whereas his siblings have inherited their mothers red hue. This cub is \nalso a smart creature, more inquisitive than the others. All five want to explore \nthe wall of light, towards which they crawl, only to be pushed back by their \nmother. The gray cub soon learns to distinguish between nudges that are rebukes \nand crushing paws that serve to hurt. He also learns how to inflict hurt and how \nto avoid being hurt. During his cubhood, he watches his parents take careful \ncare of him. He also watches as all his siblings are lost to starvation. When \nhis father stops visiting them, the she-wolf knows he has been killed by the lynx \nin a fight. In turn, she carefully avoids the territory where the lynx is taking \ncare of her litter of kittens, for the she-wolf is powerless to fight her and \nwin by herself.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang11.html"}
