{"name": "chapter 5", "summary": "After his adventure, \nthe cub rests for two days before setting out again. This time he encounters the \nbaby weasel and devours it with relish. He also finds his way back to the cave \neasily when he is tired. In sharpening his own skills, he tries to follow the \nexample of his mother. However, as he grows older, the she-wolf grows impatient \nwith him.<PARAGRAPH>Since food is short, the cub now goes hunting in deadly earnest, \nnot just for the joy of it. Failure encourages him further, and he carefully hunts \nfor squirrels, woodmice, and birds. He even challenges the hawk. The she-wolf \neventually brings him the meat of a lynx cub. She herself has devoured the rest \nof the litter. She is later challenged to a fight by the mother lynx, and the \ncub participates. After a long fight, the lynx is finally killed and eaten by \nmother and son. Although the cub is hurt by the lynx, he is rather proud of his \nfeat. He is also proud to accompany his mother on the hunt, where he learns the \nprinciple of eat or be eaten, the basic law of the survival of the fittest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang13.html"}
