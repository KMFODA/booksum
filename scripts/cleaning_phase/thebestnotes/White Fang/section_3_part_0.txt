{"name": "chapter 1", "summary": "This chapter concentrates \non the activities of the wolf pack, and the story is told from the perspective \nof the she-wolf. She is the leader of the pack along with a large gray wolf, a \nthree year-old, and an old, one-eyed wolf seeking to assist her. Her three companions \nare her suitors, each trying his best to gain her favor. The weaker members of \nthe pack, the very old and the very young, are led by the stronger members. Even \nthough all the wolves are extremely thin, their energy seems inexhaustible. They \ncover a number of miles each day, traveling in light and dark. They hunt and kill \na moose, whose eight hundred pounds of flesh feed the pack of forty wolves.<PARAGRAPH>The pack grows smaller and crosses into the lake country to the east, still led \nby the she-wolf. She constantly bites at her three male companions, who patiently \ntolerate her behavior. Finally, however, a fight breaks out among the three males, \nand the three-year-old is killed by the large gray wolf and the one-eyed wolf. \nThe she-wolf is proud of inspiring this battle. Later, the gray wolf is also killed, \nand the one-eyed wolf is received kindly by the she-wolf. They mate, and the she-wolf \nbegins to look for a safe place for her litter. They travel together across the \ncountry and down to the Mackenzie River, where they meet other wolves who want \nto join the pack. The one-eyed wolf will not permit newcomers.<PARAGRAPH>At one \npoint the wolves encounter a group of Indians. The she-wolf is familiar with humans \nand is tempted to return to them, but she heads back to the woods. Next, they \nencounter a snow rabbit tied to a tree, and the one-eyed wolf is surprised at \nits speed. He is not able to catch it since it springs with the movement of the \nplant that holds it. The she-wolf is familiar with the Indians hunting snares, \nand carefully gnaws off the head of the rabbit without being ensnared. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Your browser does not support the IFRAME tag.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025238/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/White_Fang/White_Fang10.html"}
