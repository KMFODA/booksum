{"name": "chapter 20", "summary": "The girls along with Laurie and Mr. Laurence enjoy the reunion with \n        Marmee. Marmee visits Amy at the Aunt's house and encourages her to hang \n        in there a bit longer. Amy displays the ring which Aunt March has already \n        given her and begs to be allowed to wear it as a reminder to keep from \n        being selfish.<PARAGRAPH>Mrs. March confides in Jo, telling her that Mr. Brook-whom she now calls \n        \"John\"-has asked permission to court Meg. Jo is not the least \n        bit happy about it as she had planned for Meg to marry Laurie. Her argument \n        is that Laurie is handsome and rich, but in reality she simply isn't willing \n        to \"let go\" of any of her sisters, nor is she really quite ready \n        to grow up herself.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide11.html"}
