{"name": "chapter 31", "summary": "Amy writes a series of letters from Europe and England. In England she \n        meets up with Laurie's English friends, Fred and Frank Vaughan. Later \n        Fred travels with Amy's party throughout France. Fred speaks French fluently \n        and takes Amy everywhere. One night they go for a sail on the Rhine River \n        and a group of students serenade them. Amy begins to think of Fred as \n        something more than a traveling companion. In her letter home, she confesses \n        that she is not truly in love with him, but she does like him and they \n        get along comfortably. She resolves to accept Fred if he should propose \n        to her. Later he has to leave as Frank is in poor health in England. He \n        asks Amy if she will be there when he comes back, and she implies that \n        she will be available.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide15.html"}
