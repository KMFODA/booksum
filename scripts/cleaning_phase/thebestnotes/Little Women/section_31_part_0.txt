{"name": "chapter 33", "summary": "Jo writes a series of letters telling about her activities in New York. \n        She makes friends with Mrs. Norton, a spinster lady who helps her get \n        acquainted and frequently invites her to the family style evening meal \n        in the large, apartment-like boarding house.<PARAGRAPH>The most important person she meets is Professor Bhaer (later called \n        Fritz) who tutors a number of children in German; he is homely and has \n        some uncouth mannerisms, but Jo likes him for his good nature and his \n        love for the children. She and Mrs. Kirke do a little sewing for him because \n        they feel sorry for him when they see him darning his own socks. Mr. Bhaer \n        insists on returning the favor by giving Jo lessons in German. After the \n        first four lessons, however, Jo is hopeless confused by the grammar. At \n        length, Mr. Bhaer tosses down the grammar book and teaches Jo by reading \n        German fairy tales with her, a method which seems to suit her much better.<PARAGRAPH>Jo finds her self taking an interest in other people and working with \n        a will. She participates in a New Years Eve masquerade and has some of \n        the snobbish young men deciding that she is an \"actress.\" Professor \n        Bhaer gives Jo an anthology of Shakespeares work for a Christmas present.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide16.html"}
