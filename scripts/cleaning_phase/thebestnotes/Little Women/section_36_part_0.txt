{"name": "chapter 38", "summary": "John and Meg endure a minor storm in their marriage. Meg has been devoting \n        all of her time and energies to the twins to the exclusion of her husband. \n        The housework has been allowed to slide while Meg spends the day in the \n        nursery. When John gets home from work, he has to tread lightly and speak \n        softly to avoid disturbing sleeping children, and Meg is not interested \n        in talking about anything other than domestic affairs. John begins spending \n        more and more time at the home of his friends the Scots.<PARAGRAPH>At length, Meg becomes depressed and feels that John is neglecting her. \n        She turns to her mother for advice. Mrs. March explains that the fault \n        is Meg's and urges her to let John have more to do with the children and \n        to pay more attention to John herself. She advices her to make home so \n        pleasant that John won't want to be anywhere else.<PARAGRAPH>Meg takes the advice to heart although Demi tests her resolve on the \n        first night by refusing to stay in bed. She allows John to take over the \n        task in spit of Demi's screams and soon discovers that John is able to \n        handle the children with just the right mix of firmness and love. That \n        evening she tells him of the discussion with her mother and renews her \n        commitment to make their home a delightful sanctuary.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide17.html"}
