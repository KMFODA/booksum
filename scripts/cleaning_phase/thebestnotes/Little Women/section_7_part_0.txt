{"name": "chapter 8", "summary": "Laurie has invited Jo and Meg to go with him to the theater to see The \n        Seven Castles of Diamond Lake. When Amy finds out where they are going, \n        she begs to be taken along. Meg would relent, but Jo refuses, saying that \n        Amy wasnt invited, and that it would not be fair to Laurie to bring along \n        an unexpected person.<PARAGRAPH>Amy takes revenge on Jo by burning a book of stories she has been laboring \n        over. Jo is outraged, and in spite of Amys plea for forgiveness, vows \n        never to forgive her. The following day, Jo is still angry, and the rest \n        of the family are in equally sour moods, so she decides to go ice skating \n        with Laurie as a way to put herself \"to rights.\" Amy follows, \n        wanting to join them, but Jo tells her to go back, then ignores her. Amy \n        continues to follow, but is too far back to hear a warning about thin \n        ice in the middle of the lake. She skates out and falls through the ice.<PARAGRAPH>Laurie and Jo rescue Amy and get her home safely. Amy is none the worse \n        for her experience, but Jo is properly chastened, realizing that if Amy \n        had died, she would have blamed herself all her life. Jo and Marmee discuss \n        Jos bad temper and Marmee confides that a bad temper was once her own \n        fault, but that she learned to control it. Jo determines to work harder \n        on hers and asks for her mothers help.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Little_Women_Alcott/Little_Women_Study_Guide07.html"}
