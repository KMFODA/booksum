{"name": "chapter 12", "summary": "In order to shorten the journey, the guide passed \nto the left of the railway line, which was still in process of being built. The \nParsee declared that they would gain twenty miles by striking directly through \nthe forest. The swift trotting of the elephant horribly jostled Phileas Fogg and \nSir Francis Cromarty. After two hours the guide stopped the elephant, and gave \nhim an hour for rest. At noon, the Parsee gave the signal of departure. The country \nsoon presented a very savage aspect.<PARAGRAPH>Verne writes a little about the area \nthat they were passing through - All this portion of Bundelcund, is inhabited \nby a fanatical population, hardened in the most horrible practices of the Hindoo \nfaith. The English have not been able to secure complete dominion over this territory, \nwhich is subject to the influence of rajahs, who are almost impossible to reach \nin their inaccessible mountain hideouts. The elephant is made to hurry away each \ntime the mahout sees a band of people.<PARAGRAPH>Some thoughts troubled the worthy \nservant - Passepartout - What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant when he got \nto Allahabad? As he deliberated on such issues, the principal chain of the Vindhias \nwas crossed by eight in the evening, and another halt was made on the northern \nslope, in a ruined bungalow. They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day, \nand an equal distance still separated them from the station of Allahabad.<PARAGRAPH>The group stops for the night. Nothing occurred during the night to disturb the \nslumberers, although occasional growls of panthers and chattering of monkeys broke \nthe silence. The journey was resumed at six in the morning. Kiouni soon descended \nthe lower spurs of the Vindhias, and towards noon they passed by the village of \nKallenger, on the Cani, one of the branches of the Ganges. Allahabad was now only \ntwelve miles away. They stopped under a clump of bananas. Then they entered a \nthick forest. They had not as yet had any unpleasant encounters, and the journey \nseemed on the point of being successfully accomplished, when the elephant suddenly \nstopped.<PARAGRAPH>They heard a confused murmur, which came through the thick branches. \nPassepartout was all eyes and ears. Mr. Fogg waited patiently without a word. \nThe Parsee went to find out where the sounds came from. He soon returned, saying: \n\"A procession of Brahmins is coming this way. We must prevent their seeing \nus, if possible.\" The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket, \nat the same time asking the travelers not to stir. He hoped that the procession \nwould pass without having noticed them.<PARAGRAPH>The discordant tones of the voices \nand instruments drew nearer. The head of the procession soon appeared beneath \nthe trees and here Verne describes the nature of the procession. Sir Francis Cromarty \npoints out that the procession was that of goddess Kali. A group of old fakirs \nwere making a wild ado round the statue; these were striped with ochre, and covered \nwith cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop. Some Brahmins were leading a \nwoman who faltered at every step. This woman was young, and as fair as a European. \nThe procession also included the body of a dead man. Sir Francis watched the procession \nwith a sad countenance, and, turning to the guide, said, \"A suttee.\" \nFogg had heard what Sir Francis said, and, as soon as the procession had disappeared, \nasked: \"What is a suttee?\" The general explained that a suttee is a \nhuman sacrifice, but a voluntary one. Passepartout is enraged by such an act. \nFogg wonders aloud how come the British have not put an end to such practices. \nIt is explained to him that areas such as this are out of the control of the British \nauthorities. While Sir Francis was speaking, the guide shook his head several \ntimes, and now said: \"The sacrifice which will take place tomorrow at dawn \nis not a voluntary one.\" He then goes on to talk about what he terms - the \nBundelcund affair. He tells the others that this lady was being forced to commit \nsuttee and that she had been doped on opium.<PARAGRAPH>The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket. Just at the moment that he \nwas about to urge Kiouni forward, Mr. Fogg stopped him, and, turning to Sir Francis \nCromarty, said, \"Suppose we save this woman.\" Sir Francis is surprised \nand Fogg explains that he has twelve hours to spare and that they can devote that \ntime to try and save her.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nThe adventures on \nthe elephant begin their recounting in this chapter. The Parsee mahout does not \ntake the path along the railway line. This line, owing to the capricious turnings \nof the Vindhia Mountains, did not pursue a straight course. Fogg, Sir Francis \nand Cromarty are jostled madly on top of the trotting elephant. But, they endure \nthe discomfort with true British phlegm, talking little, and scarcely able to \ncatch a glimpse of each other. As for Passepartout, who was mounted on the beast's \nback, and received the direct force of each concussion as he trod along, he was \nvery careful, in accordance with his master's advice, to keep his tongue from \nbetween his teeth, as it would otherwise have been bitten off short.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout \nis often a source of humor, as he is now. Verne writes - \" The worthy fellow \nbounced from the elephant's neck to his rump, and vaulted like a clown on a spring-board; \nyet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing, and from time to time took a piece \nof sugar out of his pocket, and inserted it in Kiouni's trunk, who received it \nwithout in the least slackening his regular trot.\" Verne also adequately \ndescribes the landscape that they are passing through. - \" Copses of dates \nand dwarf-palms succeeded the dense forests; then vast, dry plains, dotted with \nscanty shrubs, and sown with great blocks of syenite.\"<PARAGRAPH>The guide \ngives the elephant and the part some rest after few hours of travelling. Neither \nSir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the delay, and both descended with a feeling \nof relief. \"Why, he's made of iron!\" exclaimed the general, gazing admiringly \non Kiouni.<PARAGRAPH>\"Of forged iron,\" replied Passepartout, as he set \nabout preparing a hasty breakfast.<PARAGRAPH>Verne has portrayed a very exotic picture \nof the landscape. He writes that the travelers several times saw bands of ferocious \nIndians, who, when they perceived the elephant striding across country, made angry \narid threatening motions. Many English writers writing on India, present it's \nnatives as savage creatures. Here, Verne says that the Parsee avoided them as \nmuch as possible. Few animals were observed on the route; even the monkeys hurried \nfrom their path with contortions and grimaces, which convulsed Passepartout with \nlaughter.<PARAGRAPH>We notice that Passepartout has a predilection towards pondering \nand worrying, especially whenever he has the free time. While on the elephant, \nhe worries about it. He wonders how Fogg will get rid of such a heavy animal after \nthey have reached Allahabad. He thinks - \" Would he carry him on with him? \nImpossible! The cost of transporting him would make him ruinously expensive. Would \nhe sell him, or set him free? The estimable beast certainly deserved some consideration. \nShould Mr. Fogg choose to make him, Passepartout, a present of Kiouni, he would \nbe very much embarrassed...\" Such thoughts did not cease worrying him for \na long time.<PARAGRAPH>The group spends the night at an abandoned bungalow. The \nnight was cold. The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few dry branches, \nand the warmth was very grateful, provisions purchased at Kholby sufficed for \nsupper, and the travelers ate ravenously. The conversation, beginning with a few \ndisconnected phrases, soon gave place to loud and steady snores. The guide watched \nKiouni, who slept standing, bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree. \nSir Francis slept heavily, like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue. Passepartout \nwas wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before. As for Mr. Fogg, \nhe slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansion in Savile Row. \nFogg is untouched and calm in each and every situation. His strong constitution \nis indeed remarkable.<PARAGRAPH>The next day, the party stops in a grove of banana \ntrees and savors the fruit. The banana fruit is described as \" healthy as \nbread and as succulent as cream\" which was \" amply partaken of and appreciated.\" \nAfter having resumed their journey and having traveled a few miles, the elephant \nsuddenly grows restless. The mahout takes the elephant to a shady grove and goes \nto investigate the source of the noise. It turns out to be a Brahmin procession. \nThe mahout holds himself ready to bestride the animal at a moment's notice, should \nflight become necessary; but he evidently thinks that the procession of the faithful \nwould pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage, in which they were \nwholly concealed. The murmur soon became more distinct; it now seemed like a distant \nconcert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments.<PARAGRAPH>An interesting \nview of the Brahmin procession is obtained. Verne writes - \"... the strange \nfigures who performed the religious ceremony were easily distinguished through \nthe branches. First came the priests, with mitres on their heads, and clothed \nin long lace robes. They were surrounded by men, women, and children, who sang \na kind of lugubrious psalm, interrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines \nand cymbals; while behind them was drawn a car with large wheels, the spokes of \nwhich represented serpents entwined with each other. Upon the car, which was drawn \nby four richly caparisoned zebus, stood a hideous statue with four arms, the body \ncolored a dull red, with haggard eyes, disheveled hair, protruding tongue, and \nlips tinted with betel. It stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and headless \ngiant. Sir Francis, recognizing the statue, whispered, \"The goddess Kali; \nthe goddess of love and death.\" \"Of death, perhaps,\" muttered back \nPassepartout, \"but love that ugly old hag? Never!\"<PARAGRAPH>The curious \nfeature of the procession is a fair woman who is walking in a dazed manner. Her \nhead and neck, shoulders, ears, arms, hands, and toes were loaded down with jewels \nand gems with bracelets, earrings, and rings; while a tunic bordered with gold, \nand covered with a light muslin robe, betrayed the outline of her form. The guards \nwho followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to her, armed as they \nwere with swords hung at their waists, and long damascened pistols, and bearing \na corpse on a palanquin. It was the body of an old man, gorgeously arrayed in \nthe habiliments of a rajah, wearing, as in life, a turban embroidered with pearls, \na robe of tissue of silk and gold, a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds, and \nthe magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince. Next came the musicians and a rearguard \nof capering fakirs, whose cries sometimes drowned the noise of the instruments; \nthese closed the procession.<PARAGRAPH>Sir Francis mutters that this is a suttee \nprocession. The Parsee nodded, and put his finger to his lips. The procession \nslowly wound under the trees, and soon its last ranks disappeared in the depths \nof the wood. The songs gradually died away; occasionally cries were heard in the \ndistance, until at last all was silence again. When the meaning of the word suttee \nis explained to Fogg, Passepartout gets angry at the idea of human sacrifice. \n\"Oh, the scoundrels!\" cried Passepartout, who could not repress his \nindignation. \"And the corpse?\" asked Mr. Fogg.<PARAGRAPH>\"Is that \nof the prince, her husband,\" said the guide; \"an independent rajah of \nBundelcund.\" \"Is it possible,\" resumed Phileas Fogg, his voice \nbetraying not the least emotion, \"that these barbarous customs still exist \nin India, and that the English have been unable to put a stop to them?\" \"These \nsacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of India,\" replied Sir Francis; \n\"but we have no power over these savage territories, and especially here \nin Bundelcund. The whole district north of the Vindhias is the theatre of incessant \nmurders and pillage.\" 'The poor wretch!\" exclaimed Passepartout, \"to \nbe burned alive!\" \"Yes,\" returned Sir Francis, \"burned alive. \nAnd, if she were not, you cannot conceive what treatment she would be obliged \nto submit to from her relatives. They would shave off her hair, feed her on a \nscanty allowance of rice, treat her with contempt; she would be looked upon as \nan unclean creature, and would die in some corner, like a scurvy dog. The prospect \nof so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much \nmore than love or religious fanaticism. Sometimes, however, the sacrifice is really \nvoluntary, and it requires the active interference of the Government to prevent \nit. Several years ago, when I was living at Bombay, a young widow asked permission \nof the governor to be burned along with her husband's body; but, as you may imagine, \nhe refused. The woman left the town, took refuge with an independent rajah, and \nthere carried out her self devoted purpose.\" Through this conversation, Verne \nis able to explain the orthodox Indian customs that prevailed in India even after \nthe British had come in. An Indian reader would not be surprised by a reference \nto such customs, but the western reader will find the idea of suttee curious and \nunheard of.<PARAGRAPH>It is the Parsee Guide, who points out that in this particular \ncase of suttee, the human sacrifice is not voluntary, but forced. He relates the \nstory of an old Rajah's young wife who was being forced to burn herself. The wretched \ncreature did not seem to be making any resistance only because she was drugged \nwith opium. \"That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp \nand opium.\", the guide says. 'But where are they taking her?\" \"To \nthe pagoda of Pillaji, two miles from here; she will pass the night there.\" \n\"And the sacrifice will take place--\" \"Tomorrow, at the first light \nof dawn.\" When these words are being exchanged, we can never guess what shall \nbe following and how Fogg is already thinking of something in his sharp mind.<PARAGRAPH>When the guide is about to move the elephant on towards Allahabad, Fogg \ndoes the most unusual thing. He asks whether it would be possible to save the \nwoman as he has time in hand. He says - \"I have yet twelve hours to spare; \nI can devote them to that.\" \"Why, you are a man of heart!\" \"Sometimes,\" \nreplied Phileas Fogg, quietly; \"when I have the time.\" The reader realizes \nthat there is more to Fogg than the mere mathematically precise and logical man. \nHe has a huge heart but that he puts it into function only when required, along \nwith the neat working of his brain. Fogg endears himself even more not only to \nPassepartout by this action, but also to the readers.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days17.html"}
