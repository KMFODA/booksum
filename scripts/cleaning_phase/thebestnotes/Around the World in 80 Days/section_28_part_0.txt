{"name": "chapter 24", "summary": "In this chapter, is related what happens with Fogg \nwhen they sight the ship at Shanghai. Aouda, Fix and Fogg got on board the steamer, \nwhich resumed her journey to Yokohama. Fogg finds out on reaching Yokohama, that \nPassepartout too had reached the city, aboard the Carnatic. Fogg starts searching \nfor Passepartout and finally finds him in Honorable Batulcar's performance. Aouda \ntells Passepartout about their journey aboard the Tankadere along with Fix but \nPassepartout betrays no sign of knowing Fix.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg hears Passepartout's \nstory and gives him some money for garments. Fogg, Aouda and Passepartout sail \nin the 'General Grant' from Yokohama to San Francisco. The passengers and the \njourney on the ship is described. Aouda starts getting more and more drawn towards \nFogg and Passepartout notices this. He likes Aouda and hopes that a relationship \nbetween his master and her would materialize. The technicalities of Fogg's travel \nare related.<PARAGRAPH>Fix in the meanwhile is aboard the General Grant too. But \nhe is without warrant and is frustrated. On seeing Passepartout on the ship, he \nhides but they do come face to face one day. After Passepartout gives Fix a blow, \nthe latter explains that he is determined to help Fogg reach England as early \nas possible because it is only in England that it can be decided whether Fogg \nis guilty or not. The both decide to be allies and Passepartout warns Fix not \nto be treacherous. After eleven days, the General Grant reaches San Francisco.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nThe journey on the ship General Grant is related \nafter we are told what transpires, when John Bunsby signals the larger ship. Verne \nmanages to interpolate various episodes, the past and the present neatly and systematically. \nSo all the gaps in the story are bridged. The reader gets to know exactly how \nFogg, Aouda and Fix reach Yokohama. At Yokohama, Fogg takes extreme pains to locate \nPassepartout, one can see that the master is genuinely anxious about his valet, \nthough he may not express it so openly. Aouda on the other hand is very open about \nher affection for Passepartout. Once, the two parties are reunited Fogg shows \nthat he can be large hearted and forgiving. He does not reprimand Passepartout \nfor getting intoxicated at Hong Kong. He merely gives him some money quietly for \nclothes. We know that Passepartout respects Fogg greatly. We now learn that Aouda's \naffection for Fogg is deepening into love. This romantic interest in the novel \nseems natural and does not seem contrived. We can understand how a young beautiful, \nhelpless princess can fall in love with a calm efficient and handsome man of the \nworld. However we do not know how Fogg feels as he rarely expresses his emotions. \nPassepartout understands Aouda's heart and hopes the best for her.<PARAGRAPH>In \nthis chapter too a little space is devoted to the depiction of the ship and its \npassengers. This is necessary in order to create an authentic background. The \ndetective Fix is not doing too well. His warrant of arrest for Fogg has expired \nand he now has to follow the man all the way to England. Fix is clever and manages \nto convince Passepartout that he will be aiding Fogg to reach England early. It's \na pity that Passepartout trusts Fix so easily. In Verne's otherwise compact and \nbelievable story, the relation between Fix and Passepartout seems a little anomalous. \nWe wonder why Passepartout does not reveal Fix's true intentions to Fogg but we \nsee how this step then contributes to the growth and development of the plot.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout and Fix agree to be allies. Fogg finally reaches San Francisco \nand has so far neither gained nor lost a single day.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days25.html"}
