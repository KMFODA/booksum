{"name": "chapter 1", "summary": "Mr. Phileas Fogg lived at No. 7, Savile Row, Burlington Gardens. He was one of \nthe most noticeable members of the Reform Club, about who little was known, except \nthat he was a polished man of the world. Little was known of his history and his \nsource of wealth. Many conjectured as to the nature of his past. It was likely \nthat he had traveled a great deal though it was certain that he had not absented \nhimself from London for many years. The first part of the first chapter is primarily \ndevoted to the description of Mr. Fogg and his activities. His activities are \ndescribed as being those of a meticulous man, highly organized, punctual and habitual.<PARAGRAPH>When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club--its kitchens \nand pantries, its buttery and dairy--aided to crowd his table with their most \nsucculent stores; he was served by the gravest waiters, in the best possible way. \nThe mansion in Savile Row was exceedingly comfortable. The habits of its occupant \ndemanded but little from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him to be \nsuperhumanly prompt and regular. He had dismissed James Forster, because that \nluckless youth had brought him shaving-water at a slightly different temperature \nthan required. Passepartout had come for a job to Phileas Fogg and hoped to become \nthe next valet. Mr. Fogg and Mr. Passepartout meet and finalize the nature of \nthe services that Passepartout shall perform for Mr. Fogg. Mr. Passepartout is \nhired as a valet. Phileas Fogg then went off without a word. Passepartout heard \nthe street door shut twice after his master and the previous servant left. Passepartout \nthen remained alone in the house in Savile Row.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nJules Verne places the story on a particular date of 1872. There are \nno words wasted on unnecessary descriptions and Savile Row and its resident are \nimmediately described in great detail. In the very first chapter, we are made \nto completely understand the nature of the hero of the story - Phileas Fogg. Though \nhe seemed always to avoid attracting attention; he attracted a lot of it and he \ncame across as an enigmatical personage. In Jules Verne's own language: \" \nPeople said that he resembled Byron--at least that his head was Byronic; but he \nwas a bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without growing \nold\".<PARAGRAPH>Certainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas \nFogg was a Londoner. He was never seen on 'Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the \ncounting-rooms of the \"City\"; no ships ever came into London docks of \nwhich he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been entered \nat any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln's Inn, or Gray's \nInn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of Chancery, or in the Exchequer, \nor the Queen's Bench, or the Ecclesiastical Courts'. He certainly was not a manufacturer; \nnor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer. His name was strange to the scientific \nand learned societies, and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations \nof the Royal Institution or the London Institution, the Artisan's Association, \nor the Institution of Arts and Sciences. All that was known about him was that \nhe was a member of the Reform Club. The way in which he got admission to this \nexclusive club was simple enough. The Barings, with whom he had an open credit, \nrecommended him.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator also comments on the state of things using \nthe third person dialogue. He writes - \" Was Phileas Fogg rich? Undoubtedly. \nBut those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune, and \nMr. Fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information.\" Thus, \nwhile he presents dialogue between the characters as it might have really happened, \nhe also controls the characters with his third person omniscience. The author \nmost definitely likes his hero who is made to fit the heroic mode quite well. \nPhileas Fogg, in Mr. Verne's words - \" was not lavish, nor, on the contrary, \navaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble, useful, or \nbenevolent purpose, he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously.\"<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Verne also describes the effect that Phileas Fogg had \non others. Thus, the hero is placed against the larger canvas of the society and \nthat is important for any complete and panoramic novel. This is how Phileas must \nhave seemed to others - \" He was, in short, the least communicative of men. \nHe talked very little, and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner. \nHis daily habits were quite open to observation; but whatever he did was so exactly \nthe same thing that he had always done before, that the wits of the curious were \nfairly puzzled.\" The author seems to be satirizing the usual society of London \nwho found it difficult to understand exceptional characters such as Phileas and \nwere enamoured by them.<PARAGRAPH>The main theme of the novel - the journey of the \nhero around the world also finds a place within the first chapter itself. Reference \nis made to the hero's knowledge of the world around him - \"No one seemed \nto know the world more familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not \nappear to have an intimate acquaintance with it. He often corrected, with a few \nclear words, the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost \nand unheard-of travelers, pointing out the true probabilities, and seeming as \nif gifted with a sort of second sight, so often did events justify his predictions. \nHe must have traveled everywhere, at least in the spirit.\"<PARAGRAPH>Those \nwho were honored by a better acquaintance with Mr. Fogg than the rest declared \nthat nobody could pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else. His sole pastimes \nwere reading the papers and playing cards. He often won at this game, which, as \na silent one, harmonized with his nature; but his winnings never went into his \npurse, being reserved as a fund for his charities. Mr. Fogg played, not to win, \nbut for the sake of playing. The game was in his eyes a contest, a struggle with \na difficulty, yet a motionless, unwavering struggle, congenial to his tastes. \nIndeed, the reader does start looking forward to reading more about a heroic and \nnoble person such as he. In the main part of the book, we shall see how the game \nof whist is replaced by the game of going around the world in eighty days. Both \nendeavors require a determined will, which Mr. Fogg has in plenty.<PARAGRAPH>The \ndescription of Mr. Fogg's daily activities incites curiosity. He breakfasted and \ndined at the club, at hours mathematically fixed, in the same room, at the same \ntable, never taking his meals with other members, much less bringing a guest with \nhim; and went home at exactly midnight, only to retire at once to bed. He never \nused the cozy chambers, which the Reform provides for its favored members. He \npassed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row, either in sleeping or \nmaking his toilet. When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in \nthe entrance hall with its mosaic flooring, or in the circular gallery with its \ndome supported by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns, and illumined by blue painted \nwindows. Our hero seems to lead a meticulous existence but we shall see how all \nthe meticulousness shall be replaced instead by a mad dashing around the world.<PARAGRAPH>In the first chapter, we are also introduced to Mr. Passepartout, who \nis the second most important character in the novel. While he too is an honest \nand orderly man, there is a sense of clumsiness around him and he has apparently \nhad a more adventurous, colorful life than his master. As he himself says, - \" \nI believe I'm honest, monsieur, but, to be outspoken, I've had several trades. \nI've been an itinerant singer, a circus-rider, when I used to vault like Leotard, \nand dance on a rope like Blondin. Then I got to be a professor of gymnastics, \nso as to make better use of my talents; and then I was a sergeant fireman at Paris, \nand assisted at many a big fire. But I quitted France five years ago, and, wishing \nto taste the sweets of domestic life, took service as a valet here in England.\" \nHe has good references and it seems that Mr. Fogg appreciates honesty, as Mr. \nPassepartout is given the job immediately. We shall soon see how Mr. Fogg and \nMr. Passepartout make an excellent, entertaining pair.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days06.html"}
