{"name": "chapter 22", "summary": "In this chapter the focus shifts from what happens \non the Tankadere to what happens on the Carnatic. Passepartout had managed to \nboard the Carnatic in spite of his opium intoxication. He goes looking for Fogg \non the ship but does not find either his master or Aouda. He starts feeling very \nangry about Fix for acting so deceitfully and for making him drunk. Passepartout \nreaches Yokohama on the 13 th and not having anything better to do \nonce he was there, he starts to walk about aimlessly on the street. He felt completely \nstranded. After roaming the European quarter of the city, he moves to the Japanese \nquarter. This quarter is described quaintly. Passepartout reached the countryside \nas well and by now he was very hungry. When night came, he went back to the native \npart of the city and strolled about for some hours there. He saw 'yakoonins'- \nJapanese officers and laughed inwardly at them.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nIn the previous chapter Verne had recounted the fate of Fogg, Aouda and Fix on \nthe ship Tankadere. Now, Verne uses the simultaneous technique to tell us what \nis happening with Passepartout. We were curious as to what happened to the intoxicated \nvalet and we learn that in this chapter.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout manages to get aboard \nthe Carnatic. Inwardly, he is a loyal man and in spite of his intoxication he \nmanages to stagger aboard the Carnatic. He cares about Fogg and that is apparent. \nHe is worried about the fact that he has let down his master but looks forward \nto apologizing to him. But, he finds that Fogg and Aouda are not on the ship and \nthat's when he feels truly remorseful. He realizes the treacherous behavior of \nFix but is helpless and cannot do anything.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout has in fact hindered \nhis master's journey quite a few times. Though he is well meaning he keeps getting \ninto trouble because of his blustering ways.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout realizes that \nhe has no money once he reaches Yokohama, so he eats all he can on the ship. Indeed, \nhe has a large appetite.<PARAGRAPH>A large chunk of the chapter is devoted to depiction \nof Yokohama City. Verne has described it in minute detail, so we can imagine our \nbeloved Passepartout roaming the streets. He is hungry and tired but decides against \ngoing to the Consulate because he is ashamed of relating his irresponsible behavior \nto the authorities. Despite his troubles, he still shows an ability to laugh and \nwhen he comes across dazzling Japanese patrols, he thinks-'Hallo! Here's another \nJapanese embassy on its way to Europe!'", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days24.html"}
