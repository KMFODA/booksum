{"name": "chapter 19", "summary": "The island of Hong \nKong is described. Passepartout goes roaming around the place. He sees Fix who \nlooks extremely disappointed, Fix has yet not the warrant to arrest Fogg. Together, \nthey go and engage cabins for four persons. Then Fix decides to let Passepartout \nin on the secret of his mission and offers him a drink. While they both talk thinking \nthat they are referring to the same topic, in reality they are talking at two \ndifferent tangents. While Fix is referring to the robbery, Passepartout is referring \nto the fact that Fix is an agent of the Reform Club members. Finally, Fix explains \nto Passepartout his real purpose, as a detective and Passepartout is shocked. \nThe loyal valet believes not a word of Fix and is so upset that he drinks more \nand more. Fix gives the straightforward valet some opium too and the latter falls \nto the ground stupefied by the narcotic. Fix is happy that Fogg will not be informed \nabout the hour of sailing of the Carnatic. Fix leaves the tavern.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nHong Kong is depicted quaintly. Passepartout, the usual vagabond \nroams the city before proceeding to the dockyard. He sees Fix yet again and is \nglad to see him looking disillusioned. Passepartout is still under the delusion \nthat Fix is an agent when he really is not one. Passepartout makes fun of Fix \nbefore they proceed once again to book their rooms on the ship Carnatic. The manner \nin which Passepartout laughs at others never seems mean or deriding; it is plain \namusement and mirth and that is one quality that makes us like him.<PARAGRAPH>Fix \nis shown as an unscrupulous man in this chapter. Taking advantage of Passepartout's \nnaivete, he offers the latter drinks and then proceeds to try and bribe him. But, \nPassepartout affirms his loyalty to his master and refuses to hamper his master's \nplan in any way. In fact Passepartout is so fond of his master that he is deeply \nupset when the charge of robbery is slapped against him.<PARAGRAPH>The flaw in Passepartout \nis that when he is emotional, he has no control over himself. He gets more and \nmore intoxicated, while Fix plays a dirty trick on him and offers him opium. Finally, \nthe valet collapses and we are very angry at Fix for this treachery. He is utterly \nselfish and is happy now, as he thinks that Fogg will not be informed correctly \nabout the ship Carnatic's departure. We are left curious as to what will happen \nnext.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days22.html"}
