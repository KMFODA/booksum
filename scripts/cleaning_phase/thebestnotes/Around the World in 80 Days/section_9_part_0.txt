{"name": "chapter 5", "summary": "Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London would create a lively \nsensation. The news of the bet spread through the Reform Club, and got into the \npapers throughout England. The boasted \"tour of the world\" was talked \nabout, disputed and argued by many. Some took sides with Phileas Fogg, but the \nlarge majority shook their heads and declared against him. Those who did not support \nhim declared, that the tour of the world could be made, but only theoretically. \nNumerous articles in papers debated the question of the possibility of such a \njourney. The ladies supported Fogg after seeing a picture of his handsome figure.<PARAGRAPH>At last a long article appeared, on the 7 th of October, in \nthe bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society, which treated the question from \nevery point of view, and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterprise. It showed \nhow Fogg would have to mathematically jump from trains to ships and so on to be \nable to accomplish the task at hand. It pointed out the many obstacles that would \nbe faced. This article made a great deal of noise, and, being copied into all \nthe papers, seriously depressed the advocates of the rash tourist.<PARAGRAPH>England \nis the world of betting men, who are of a higher class than mere gamblers. Not \nonly the members of the Reform, but the general public, made heavy wagers for \nor against Phileas Fogg, who was set down in the betting books as if he were a \nrace-horse. Bonds were issued, and made their appearance on 'Change. Though after \nthe article, the value of Fogg stock declined. Lord Albemarle, an elderly paralytic \ngentleman, was now the only advocate of Phileas Fogg left. He felt that if the \njourney could be accomplished, an Englishman should complete it first. The Fogg \nparty dwindled more and more, everybody was going against him, and the bets stood \na hundred and fifty and two hundred to one; and a week after his departure an \nincident occurred which deprived him of backers at any price.The commissioner \nof police received the following telegraphic dispatch:- Suez. Rowan, Chief of \nPolice, Scotland Yard, London. 'Am shadowing bank thief, Phileas Fogg. Send without \ndelay warrant for arrest Bombay .Detective Fix'<PARAGRAPH>The effect of this dispatch \nwas instantaneous. The polished gentleman disappeared to give place to the bank \nrobber. His photograph was minutely examined, and it betrayed, feature by feature, \nthe description of the robber which had been provided to the police. The mysterious \nhabits of Phileas Fogg were recalled; his solitary ways, his sudden departure; \nand it seemed clear that, in undertaking a tour round the world on the pretext \nof a wager, he had no other end in view than to elude the detectives, and throw \nthem off his track.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nAfter Fogg left London, the news \nof his wager with the other Reform Club members and the fact that he was attempting \nto go around the world in eighty days spread around. It became a national pastime \nto discuss Fogg and his seemingly impossible endeavor. What is remarkable about \nJules Verne and his description of the excitement caused by Fogg, is the fact \nthat he is able to do it in such few words. In just a few paragraphs, the author \nmanages to paint the picture of England as it was then as well as its favorite \nhobby of betting. The general consensus amongst the public is that a journey around \nthe world in eighty days is possible, but only on paper. The newspapers took a \ngreat interest in analyzing the pros and cons of the matter. The Times, Standard, \nMorning Post, and Daily News, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted \nMr. Fogg's project as madness; the Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly supported \nhim. People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his Reform Club friends \nfor having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer. \nBy describing such events at London, Verne manages to universalize Fogg's lone \neffort. While the story primarily revolves around Fogg, the mention of those around \nhim proceeds to add interest to the narrative.<PARAGRAPH>Articles no less passionate \nthan logical appeared on the question of Fogg's effort, for geography is one of \nthe pet subjects of the English; and the columns devoted to Phileas Fogg's venture \nwere eagerly devoured by all classes of readers. At first some rash individuals, \nprincipally of the gentler sex, espoused his cause, which became still more popular \nwhen the Illustrated London News came out with his portrait, copied from a photograph \nin the Reform Club. A few readers of the Daily Telegraph even dared to say, \"Why \nnot, after all? Stranger things have come to pass.\"<PARAGRAPH>But, some time \nlater a rational article appeared in the bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society. \nEverything, it said, was against the travelers, and it highlighted every obstacle \nimposed alike by man and by nature in the attempted journey. It emphasized that \na miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival, which was impossible, \nwas absolutely necessary to Fogg's success. He might, perhaps, reckon on the arrival \nof trains at the designated hours, in Europe, where the distances were relatively \nmoderate; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days, and the United \nStates in seven, could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task? There \nwere accidents to machinery, the liability of trains to run off the line, collisions, \nbad weather, the blocking up by snow. Were not all these against Phileas Fogg? \nWould he not find himself, when travelling by steamer in winter, at the mercy \nof the winds and fogs? Is it not uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be two \nor three days behind time? But a single delay would suffice to fatally break the \nchain of communication; should Phileas Fogg once miss, even by an hour; a steamer, \nhe would have to wait for the next, and that would irrevocably render his attempt \nvain.<PARAGRAPH>Thus, the reader is aware of the hindrances in the path before the \nobstacles actually appear in route for Fogg. The novel sees travel around the \nworld, but is basically based in England. The English sentiment is written about. \nJules writes - \" to bet is in the English temperament\". Phileas Fogg \nbonds\" were offered at par or at a premium, and a great business was done \nin them. But five days after the article in the bulletin of the Geographical Society \nappeared, the demand began to subside: \"Phileas Fogg\" declined. They \nwere offered by packages, at first of five, then of ten, until at last nobody \nwould take less than twenty, fifty, a hundred!<PARAGRAPH>Only one staunch supporter \nof Fogg remained - Lord Albemarle. This noble lord, who was fastened to his chair, \nwould have given his fortune to be able to make the tour of the world, if it took \nten years; and he bet five thousand pounds on Phileas Fogg. When the folly as \nwell as the uselessness of the adventure was pointed out to him, he contented \nhimself with replying, \"If the thing is feasible, the first to do it ought \nto be an Englishman.\"<PARAGRAPH>A surprising development takes place in this \nchapter. A detective sends a telegram that Fogg is the robber of the famous Bank \nof England robbery. Even the reader does not know what to make of it and Jules \nVerne successfully manages to create suspense here. We all wait with bated breath \nand wonder whether it could be possible that Fogg be a robber. After all, no one \nknows the source of his wealth, not even the reader. The idea of Fogg being a \nhigh-class thief is a very romantic one. We are eager to know what shall happen \nnext and whether Fogg's journey is merely a hoax to escape the police.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days10.html"}
