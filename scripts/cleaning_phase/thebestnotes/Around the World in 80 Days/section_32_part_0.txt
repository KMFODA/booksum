{"name": "chapter 28", "summary": "The train moves on a northerly course for an hour \nand it is in this area that the trains face the maximum difficulties. The train \npasses many streams, while Passepartout's impatience grows. During the night, \nthere is heavy snow and Passepartout starts worrying. Meanwhile, Aouda had spotted \nColonel Stamp Proctor on a station and was disturbed that Fogg might see him and \nget into an argument and fight. Aouda had begun to find Fogg very dear and her \naffection was growing.<PARAGRAPH>Aouda tells Fix and Passepartout about Colonel \nProctor's presence on the train and they all agree that it would be best if Fogg \nwere not to see the Colonel. Passepartout is surprised that Fix offers to fight \nwith the Colonel on Fogg's behalf. Later, in order to keep Fogg in the compartment \nitself, Fix offers to start a game of whist. Fogg, Fix and Aouda begin to play \ntogether. The game continues for long, while the train moves forward through new \nterrain. The group has lunch in the compartment. Suddenly the train stops and \nthe others are worried that Fogg will get up and go down to see what the cause \nof the delay is. But he doesn't get up and Passepartout goes to see what the problem \nis. The fact is that the train driver is told not to proceed ahead because a suspension \nbridge ahead, which is over rapids, is in a ruinous condition. There is a debate \nbetween the train personnel and the passengers as to what should be done. Finally, \nthe group agrees that if the train is put on full speed, it would manage to get \nover the bridge. Passepartout suggests as this step is to be taken, the passengers \nshould be told to get off and then the train should be put across the bridge at \na fast pace. No one listens to him and the train speeds on to the bridge. Luckily \nnothing happens to the train and everybody is happy to get across safely. The \nbridge of course collapses and crashes into the rapids of Medicine Bow.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nIn this chapter the train's onward journey is described. \nVerne must have had to research the details of the journeys undertaken by trains \nin America, to be able to write about them in such detail. This novel may be fictional \nbut it is placed against the background of world's reality. The places described \nare real and the travel routes outlined are those that truly existed.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout is described as being impatient. He is now involved mentally in the \nentire affair of the challenge to go around the world. While Fogg remains calm \nand does not express his desire for speed so openly, Passepartout expresses his \nworries and concerns frankly. He is loyal to his master and through every action \nof his we can gauge his goodness and humanity.<PARAGRAPH>Aouda in the meanwhile \nhad watched some passengers on the platform of Green River Station and to her \nhorror she had spotted Colonel Stamp Proctor among them. She is genuinely concerned \nabout Fogg and does not want Fogg to see the Colonel because then they would surely \nget into a bloody fight. Aouda now recognizes Fogg's character and knows that \nhis honor is very important to him and that he'll do anything to defend it. So \nAouda quietly expresses her concern to Fix and Passepartout. They decide to try \nand keep Fogg in the cabin as far as possible so that he has lesser chances of \nseeing the Colonel. Surprisingly Fix comes forward to defend Fogg's honor by agreeing \nto fight with the Colonel instead of Fogg. He is told that Fogg would not accept \nproxy fighting and that is true. Passepartout questions Fix's sudden good intention \nand Fix replies that he will do anything to speed Fogg's journey to England. We \nall know why Fix wishes to hurry Fogg into England, the one and sole purpose being \nto arrest him and to win the reward money.<PARAGRAPH>Fix and Aouda distract Fogg \nwith a game of whist and they are successful in keeping him within a cabin. The \nfact that Aouda agrees to play whist for the sake of Fogg's well being is charming. \nWe see that she is Fogg's equivalent in every way. She too plays whist well and \nis complimented by Fogg on it. Aouda is a typical idealized fictional female heroine.<PARAGRAPH>The train stops suddenly and Passepartout goes out to see what the matter \nis. Verne succeeds in adding interest to his narrative by adding a number of quaint \nand invigorating incidents, which maintain the buoyancy of the story. In this \nchapter, the curious incident of a shaky bridge is added. The bridge over some \nrapids, a mile ahead is in a shaky condition. The train is in danger if it goes \nover it but the passengers are also impatient and want to get on with their journey. \nFinally the train driver makes an innovative suggestion. If the train is made \nto go over the bridge at full speed it might be able to get across and that is \nexactly what happens.<PARAGRAPH>During the entire debate Passepartout makes a very \nsensible suggestion that the passengers could walk across the bridge, while the \ntrain could go over it at a fast speed. But, nobody pays heed to him. Passepartout \nis indeed the smart valet of an extremely efficient man-Fogg.<PARAGRAPH>The train \ncrosses Medicine Bow and all the passengers are safe. We now wait to see whether \nFogg will bump into Proctor.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days27.html"}
