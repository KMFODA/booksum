{"name": "chapter 34", "summary": "Fogg is in the prison. He is confined \nin the Custom House lock up. Aouda is shocked by Fogg's arrest whereas, Passepartout \nfeels guilty. While Fogg sits in prison, Passepartout calmly watches the hands \nof a watch move ahead. The thought of trying to escape the prison does cross his \nmind but there is no way out. While everything seems against him, suddenly Fix \nand Passepartout come inside his cell. Fix apologizes to Fogg, saying that the \nreal robber was found three days ago and that Fogg is free to go. Fogg gives Fix \na punch that knocks the latter down. Passepartout, Fogg and Aouda then go to Liverpool \nStation. Since the Express train to London had already left, Fogg hires a special \ntrain and gives the driver an incentive to reach England as fast as possible. \nBut, the train faces all kinds of insurmountable delays and when Fogg reaches \nEngland he thinks he has reached five minutes late. He thinks he has lost his \nwager.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nFogg is in prison and in serious trouble. \nFix must have taken immense pleasure in finally arresting the man, who he had \nchased all over the world. Fogg shows no emotion when he is arrested. If at all \nhe looks more grave and watches the hands of the clock move in a fixed manner. \nAouda is very sad. She respects Fogg, a great deal and is completely shaken and \nangry at the fact that others think that he may be a robber.<PARAGRAPH>But Passepartout's \nplight must have been the worse. He realizes that he should have warned Fogg about \nFix and now knows that all the delays in the journey are because of Fix. Passepartout's \nanguish is palpable and we as readers, feel that it is well deserved. He should \nhave told his master about Fix but didn't. Now he is largely to blame for Fogg's \narrest.<PARAGRAPH>Verne manages to build the tension very well. We are all aware \nof the time constraints involved for Fogg, to win the bet.<PARAGRAPH>Just when we \nthink that all is lost and that Fogg will never be able to reach London, Fix comes \nin and apologizes to him. It had been a mistake and the real robber has already \nbeen arrested. We see that while Fogg may be calm usually, he is capable of giving \nvent to his anger too. He strikes Fix down with a massive blow. The suspicion \nin the reader's mind that Fogg may be a robber is cleared. Fogg is definitely \nnot guilty.<PARAGRAPH>The trio-Fogg, Aouda and Passepartout leave for the station. \nThey want to take an Express train but it has already left. So they hire a special \ntrain which can take them to London. Even though the train driver is offered reward \nmoney in Fogg's unmistakable style the train is not able to reach London in time. \nThere are unavoidable delays and the group reaches London five minutes late. Fogg \nhas lost the bet or so he thinks, after having traveled magnificently around the \nworld.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days31.html"}
