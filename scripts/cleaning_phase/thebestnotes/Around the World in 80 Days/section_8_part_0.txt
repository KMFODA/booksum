{"name": "chapter 4", "summary": "Having won twenty guineas at whist, Phileas Fogg takes leave of \nhis friends. Passepartout, who had studied the program of his duties, was surprised \nto see his master guilty of the inexactness of appearing at an unaccustomed hour; \nfor, according to rule, he was not due in Savile Row until midnight. Passerpartout \nis even more surprised when he is told that they shall be starting for Dover and \nCalais in ten minutes.<PARAGRAPH>On being told that they shall be going around the \nworld, Passerpartout is completely taken aback as he had been expecting a very \nquiet life with his master. The servant is told that they shall be travelling \nvery light and would have no need of heavy trunks. Passepartout tried to reply \nto his master, but could not. He went out, mounted to his own room, fell into \na chair, and muttered: \"That's good, that is! And I, who wanted to remain \nquiet!\" He mechanically set about making the preparations for departure. \nHe thinks that perhaps they would go as far as Paris, and it would do his eyes \ngood to see Paris once more. By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest \ncarpet-bag, containing the wardrobes of his master and himself; then, still troubled \nin mind, he carefully shut the door of his room, and descended to Mr. Fogg.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Fogg was quite ready. Under his was a red bound copy of Bradshaw's Continental \nRailway Steam Transit and General Guide, with its timetables showing the arrival \nand departure of steamers and railways. He took the carpetbag, opened it, and \nslipped into it a goodly roll of Bank of England notes, which would pass wherever \nhe might go.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout is told to take care of the carpetbag as it \nhas twenty thousand pounds in it. Master and man then descended, the street door \nwas double locked, and they took a cab and drove rapidly to Charing Cross. When \nthey reached the station, they came across a beggar woman who asked them for alms. \nMr. Fogg is very generous and gives her twenty guineas. Passerpartout's master's \naction touched his susceptible heart.<PARAGRAPH>Two first class tickets for Paris \nhaving been speedily purchased, Mr. Fogg was crossing the station to the train, \nwhen he perceived his five friends of the Reform. He tells them that they will \nbe able to assure themselves that he has really been around the world, by checking \nhis passport. Fogg and his servant then seated themselves in a first class carriage. \nThe night was dark, and a fine, steady rain was falling. Phileas Fogg, snugly \nensconced in his corner, did not open his lips. Passepartout, not yet recovered \nfrom his stupefaction, clung mechanically to the carpetbag, with its enormous \ntreasure.<PARAGRAPH>Just as the train was whirling through Sydenham, Passepartout \nsuddenly realized that he had left the gas in his room on. \"Very well, young \nman,\" returned Mr. Fogg, coolly; \"it will burn at your expense.\"<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nPassepartout had studied his master's \ntimetable carefully and so was very surprised to see him home early. As Jules \nVerne himself writes - \" Mr. Fogg repaired to his bedroom, and called out, \n\"Passepartout!\" Passepartout did not reply. It could not be he who was \ncalled; it was not the right hour. 'Passepartout!\" repeated Mr. Fogg, without \nraising his voice.<PARAGRAPH>Passepartout made his appearance. \"I've called \nyou twice,\" observed his master.<PARAGRAPH>\"But it is not midnight,\" \nresponded the other, showing his watch.\"<PARAGRAPH>Jules Verne emphasizes Fogg's \nreputation of being precise with the surprised reaction of Passepartout. He cannot \nbelieve that his master is not on the time that he is ideally supposed to be at \nhome.<PARAGRAPH>When Fogg says that - \"We are going to travel round the world'', \nPassepartout opened wide his eyes, raised his eyebrows, held up his hands, and \nseemed about to collapse, so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment.<PARAGRAPH>'Around the world!' he murmured. 'In eighty days,\" replied Mr. Fogg. \"So \nwe must not lose a moment \".<PARAGRAPH>Later, the confused Passepartout thinks \n- Around the world in eighty days! Was his master a fool? No. Was this a joke, \nthen? They were going to Dover; good! To Calais; good again! After all, Passepartout, \nwho had been away from France five years, would not be sorry to set foot on his \nnative soil again. He finds it hard to believe that they could really be attempting \nto go around the world and thinks that the journey will end at Calais. He is wrong.<PARAGRAPH>Jules Verne describes at a racy pace the duo's exit from the house and \nto the station. . The cab stopped before the railway station at twenty minutes \npast eight. Passepartout jumped off the box and followed his master, who, after \npaying the cabman, was about to enter the station, when a poor beggar-woman, with \na child in her arms, her naked feet smeared with mud, her head covered with a \nwretched bonnet, from which hung a tattered feather, and her shoulders shrouded \nin a ragged shawl, approached, and mournfully asked for alms. Mr. Fogg is a humane \nand generous man and he helps the woman readily. He takes out some money for her. \nDespite his cold exterior, Fogg is a warm-hearted man who would go out of his \nway to help the needy.<PARAGRAPH>The other Reform Club members are there at the \nstation to see off Fogg. We wonder whether they have come to see him or are there \njust to see with their own eyes that he has really left London. Fogg is a scrupulous \nman and says - \"Gentlemen, I am off; I am taking a passport with me, so that \nthe various visas it will bear may enable you to check my itinerary when I return.\"<PARAGRAPH>Soon, Fogg and his newly acquired servant are off on their journey. Fogg \nseems cool and composed at all times. Passerpartout on the other hand often makes \nmistakes and appears more clumsily human! He remembers that he has left the gas \nof his room on. Fogg has a rational conclusion for every perturbing, perplexing \nquestion. He tells Passepartout calmly that the gas will burn at Passepartout's \nown expense. Fogg is rational and just at all occasions. We can't wait to know \nwhat will happen of their supposed attempt to roam the globe.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days09.html"}
