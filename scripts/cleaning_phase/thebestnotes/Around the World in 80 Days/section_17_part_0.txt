{"name": "chapter 13", "summary": "The project of rescuing the girl was a bold one, \nfull of difficulty. Mr. Fogg was going to risk liberty and the success of his \ntour. But he did not hesitate, and he found in Sir Francis Cromarty an enthusiastic \nally. As for Passepartout, he was ready for anything that might be proposed. He \nbegan to perceive a heart, a soul, under his master's icy exterior. He began to \nlove Phileas Fogg.<PARAGRAPH>The Indian guide too agreed to take part in the rescue \nwillingly. He gave an account of the victim, who, he said, was a celebrated beauty \nof the Parsee race, and the daughter of a wealthy Bombay merchant. Left an orphan, \nshe was married against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund; and after he \ndied, knowing the fate that awaited her, she tried to escape but was retaken. \nNow, she was being forced to commit a sacrifice that she did not want to.<PARAGRAPH>The Parsee's narrative confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in their generous \ndesign and they form a plan of action. The guide was familiar with the pagoda \nof Pillaji, in which, as he declared, the young woman was imprisoned. It was certain \nthat the abduction must be made that night, and not when, at break of day, the \nvictim was led to her funeral pyre. Then no human intervention could save her. \nAs soon as night fell, they decided to make a reconnaissance around the pagoda. \nThe cries of the fakirs were just ceasing; the Indians were in the act of plunging \nthemselves into the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp, and \nit might be possible to slip between them to the temple itself. The Parsee leads \nthe little group stealthily toward the pagoda. Much to the guide's disappointment, \nthe guards of the rajah, lighted by torches, were watching at the doors and marching \naround with swords; probably the priests, too, were watching within. The Parsee \nnow convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance to the temple, advanced \nno farther, but led his companions back again. They stopped, and engaged in a \nwhispered colloquy. They decide to wait and see whether the guards will sleep \noff.<PARAGRAPH>They waited till midnight; but no change took place among the guards. \nThe other plan must be carried out; an opening in the walls of the pagoda must \nbe made. After a last consultation, the guide announced that he was ready for \nthe attempt, and advanced, followed by the others. They took a roundabout way, \nso as to get at the pagoda on the rear. The night was very dark. It was not enough \nto reach the walls; an opening in them must be accomplished, and to attain this \npurpose the party only had their pocketknives. Luckily the temple walls were built \nof brick and wood, which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one \nbrick had been taken out, the rest would yield easily.<PARAGRAPH>They set noiselessly \nto work. They were getting on rapidly, when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior \nof the temple, followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside. \nPassepartout and the guide stopped. The group hid in the woods and saw that guards \ncame and stood at the rear of the temple too. The party was disappointed, having \nbeen interrupted in their work. The guide and Sir Francis feel that nothing can \nbe done now but Fogg requests them to hold on till the morning to see whether \nthey get a chance then. Sir Francis consented, however, to remain to the end of \nthis terrible drama. The guide led them to the rear of the glade, where they were \nable to observe the sleeping groups. Meanwhile Passepartout is struck by an idea \nand he slips out.<PARAGRAPH>The hours passed and day approached. The slumbering \nmultitude became animated, the tambourines sounded, songs and cries arose; the \nhour of the sacrifice had come. The doors of the pagoda swung open and Mr. Fogg \nand Sir Francis espied the victim. She seemed to be striving to escape from her \nexecutioner. The crowd began to move and the fakirs escorted the young woman with \ntheir wild, religious cries. Phileas Fogg and his companions, mingling in the \nrear ranks of the crowd, followed; and reached the banks of the stream. The rajah's \ncorpse lay upon a pyre. In the semi-obscurity they saw the victim, quite senseless, \nstretched out beside her husband's body. Then a torch was brought, and the wood, \nheavily soaked with oil, instantly took fire.<PARAGRAPH>At this moment Sir Francis and the guide seized Phileas Fogg, who, in an instant \nof mad generosity, was about to rush upon the pyre. But he had quickly pushed \nthem aside, when the whole scene suddenly changed. A cry of terror arose. The \nwhole multitude prostrated themselves, terror-stricken, on the ground. The old \nrajah rose all of a sudden, like a ghost, took up his wife in his arms, and descended \nfrom the pyre in the midst of the clouds of smoke, which only heightened his ghostly \nappearance. Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis stood erect, the Parsee bowed his head, and \nPassepartout was, no doubt, scarcely less stupefied. The resuscitated rajah approached \nSir Francis and Mr. Fogg, and, in an abrupt tone, said, \"Let us be off!\" \nIt was Passepartout himself, who had slipped upon the pyre in the midst of the \nsmoke and, profiting by the still overhanging darkness, had delivered the young \nwoman from death!<PARAGRAPH>Soon, all four of the party had run into the woods, \nand the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace. The cries and noise, and \na ball, which whizzed through Phileas Fogg's hat, apprised them that the trick \nhad been discovered. The old rajah's body, now appeared upon the burning pyre; \nand the priests, recovered from their terror, perceived that an abduction had \ntaken place. The soldiers fired a volley after the fugitives; but the latter rapidly \nincreased the distance between them and before long found themselves beyond the \nreach of the bullets and arrows.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nAfter Fogg \nhad made the decision to try and save the young woman, there was a lot left to \nconsider. There remained the guide: what course would he adopt? Would he take \npart with the Indians? In default of his assistance, it was necessary to be assured \nof his neutrality. Sir Francis frankly put the question to him. \"Officers,\" \nreplied the guide, \"I am a Parsee, and this woman is a Parsee. Command me, \nas you will.\" \"Excellent!\" said Mr. Fogg. \"However,\" \nresumed the guide, \"it is certain, not only that we shall risk our lives, \nbut horrible tortures, if we are taken.\" \"That is foreseen,\" replied \nMr. Fogg. \"I think we must wait till night before acting.\" \"I think \nso,\" said the guide. Thus, the guide too appears to be a brave man with a \nheart enough for others in trouble.<PARAGRAPH>The guide tells them about the woman \nbeing taken for suttee - she had received a thoroughly English education in that \ncity, and, from her manners and intelligence, would be thought a European. Her \nname was Aouda. Hearing that she was being forced to commit suttee, Fogg and Cromarty \nare determined to save her. It was decided that the guide should direct the elephant \ntowards the pagoda of Pillaji, which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible. \nThey halted, half an hour afterwards, in a copse, some five hundred feet from \nthe pagoda, where they were well concealed; but they could hear the groans and \ncries of the fakirs distinctly. They then discussed the means of getting at the \nvictim.<PARAGRAPH>They wondered if they could enter any of its doors while the whole \nparty of Indians was plunged in a drunken sleep, or was it safer to attempt to \nmake a hole in the walls? This could only be determined at the moment and the \nplace themselves; so they decide to wait and then move towards the pagoda later \nin the night. Later, the Parsee, leading the others, noiselessly crept through \nthe wood, and in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream, \nwhence, by the light of the rosin torches, they perceived a pyre of wood, on the \ntop of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah, which was to be burned with his \nwife. The pagoda, whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening dusk, \nstood a hundred steps away.<PARAGRAPH>The guide slipped more cautiously than ever \nthrough the brush, followed by his companions; the silence around was only broken \nby the low murmuring of the wind among the branches. Soon the Parsee stopped on \nthe borders of the glade, which was lit up by the torches. The ground was covered \nby groups of the Indians, motionless in their drunken sleep; it seemed a battlefield \nstrewn with the dead. Men, women, and children lay together. Verne is able to \nwrite in a way that excites the interest of the readers in the goings on. The \nguide comes across as a smart Indian. They see guards pacing up and down in front \nof Aouda's room. According to the brigadier, the guards might drop off to sleep \nsoon. But the guide says that, this was not possible. They lay down at the foot \nof a tree, and waited. The guards watched steadily by the glare of the torches, \nand a dim light crept through the windows of the pagoda. It remained to ascertain \nwhether the priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as \nwere the soldiers at the door.<PARAGRAPH>Since the guards do not move away, the \ngroup decides to make a hole at the back of the pagoda. Verne describes the night \nquite poetically - \"The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the horizon, and \nwas covered with heavy clouds; the height of the trees deepened the darkness.\" \nThey are getting quite successful in boring a hole in the wall, when they hear \na cry, which is followed by loud chaos. Had they been heard? Was the alarm being \ngiven? Common prudence urged them to retire, and they did so, followed by Phileas \nFogg and Sir Francis. They again hid themselves in the wood, and waited till the \ndisturbance, whatever it might be, ceased, holding themselves ready to resume \ntheir attempt without delay. But, awkwardly enough, the guards now appeared at \nthe rear of the temple, and there installed themselves, in readiness to prevent \na surprise.<PARAGRAPH>They could not, now reach the victim; how, then, could they \nsave her? Two people display typical human reactions and are disappointed whereas \nFogg is as cool as ever. Sir Francis shook his fists, Passepartout was beside \nhimself, and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage. The tranquil Fogg waited, \nwithout betraying any emotion. \"We have nothing to do but to go away,\" \nwhispered Sir Francis. 'Nothing but to go away,\" echoed the guide. \"Stop,\" \nsaid Fogg. \"I am only due at Allahabad tomorrow before noon.\" \"But \nwhat can you hope to do?\" asked Sir Francis. \"In a few hours it will \nbe daylight, and--\" \"The chance which now seems lost may present itself \nat the last moment.\" Sir Francis would have liked to read Phileas Fogg's \neyes. What was this cool Englishman thinking of? Was he planning to make a rush \nfor the young woman at the very moment of the sacrifice, and boldly snatch her \nfrom her executioners? Fogg surprises the reader by his uncharacteristically involved \nresponse. He insists that since he has time to spare, that they should wait till \nthe last moment to see whether they can save Aouda.<PARAGRAPH>His concern and his \nspirit displays that despite his logical ways, he is also a human with an understanding \nand courageous heart. He is indeed the hero of the novel, not just because he \nundertakes a heroic exercise, such as going around the world, but because of the \ncharacteristics that make his noble personality. In the meanwhile, Passepartout \nwho had perched himself on the lower branches of a tree, was resolving an idea \nwhich had at first struck him like a flash, and which was now firmly lodged in \nhis brain. He had commenced by saying to himself, \"What folly!\" and \nthen he repeated, \"Why not, after all? It's a chance perhaps the only one; \nand with such sots!\" Thinking thus, he slipped, with the suppleness of a \nserpent, to the lowest branches, the ends of which bent almost to the ground. \nVerne does not tell us what this comic man's idea is but we shall soon see it \nfor ourselves. Morning approaches soon and when Sir Francis and Fogg see Aouda \nstruggling to get free from her executioners, both are very angry. Sir Francis's \nheart throbbed; and, convulsively seizing Mr. Fogg's hand found in it an open \nknife. They join the last ranks of the priests in the procession towards the pyre. \nAouda is laid down, by her husband and the pyre is lit.<PARAGRAPH>Fogg is about \nto make a dash for Aouda, when the guide and Sir Francis stop him. This is one \nof the few occasions, when Fogg acts impulsively, defying logic and practicality. \nBut, we soon see that Fogg does not need to carry out his sacrifice, as the gathering \nis shocked suddenly by the ghost like figure of the rajah who seems to have gotten \nup and having picked up his wife, starts walking down. Fakirs and soldiers and \npriests, seized with instant terror, lay there, with their faces on the ground, \nnot daring to lift their eyes and behold such a prodigy. The inanimate victim \nwas borne along by the vigorous arms which supported her, and which she did not \nseem in the least to burden. Aouda of course is still quite unconscious and does \nnot have any clue as to what is happening around her. It is the orthodox and superstitious \nnature of the Indians that proves to be their downfall eventually. They are scared \nby what seems to them to be the ghost of the rajah and let the figure walk away. \nThey would have realized their folly there and then, had they looked up.<PARAGRAPH>This figure soon addresses Fogg and the others in English and it is then that \nwe realize that the specter is actually none other than Passepartout who, playing \nhis part with a happy audacity, had passed through the crowd amid the general \nterror. Passepartout is the unquestioned hero of this chapter and it is because \nof his ingenuity that Fogg's mission is completed and Aouda is saved. Fogg might \nhave come up with the idea of rescuing the woman, but it is Passepartout who finally \ncarries forth the rescue. It is a very interesting way to end the chapter and \nVerne definitely does not seem to lack any exciting ideas. By the time, the priests \nrealize that an abduction has taken place, the English group is fleeing away on \nthe elephant. The soldiers do fire at the fliers, but they manage to escape unharmed.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days18.html"}
