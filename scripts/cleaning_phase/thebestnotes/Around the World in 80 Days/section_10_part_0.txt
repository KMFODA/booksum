{"name": "chapter 6", "summary": "In this chapter, Verne explains the circumstances in which the above \nmentioned telegraphic dispatch about Phileas Fogg was sent. The steamer Mongolia, \nbelonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company, was due at eleven o'clock a.m. \non the 9 th of October, at Suez. The Mongolia plied regularly between \nBrindisi and Bombay via the Suez Canal.<PARAGRAPH>Two men were promenading up and \ndown the wharves, among the crowd of natives. One was the British consul at Suez, \nwho was in the habit of seeing, from his office window, English ships daily passing \nto and fro on the great canal. The other was a small built personage with a nervous, \nintelligent face, and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows, which he was \nincessantly twitching. He was manifesting signs of impatience, nervously pacing \nup and down. This was Fix, one of the detectives who had been dispatched from \nEngland in search of the bank robber. It was his responsibility to note all suspicious \nlooking people. The detective was inspired by the hope of obtaining the splendid \nreward, which would be the prize of success, and waited with a feverish impatience, \nthe arrival of the steamer Mongolia. He has a conversation with the consul, while \nawaiting the arrival of the Mongolia, in which he explains how he proposed to \nfind the robber. Mr. Fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit.<PARAGRAPH>As he passed among the busy crowd, Fix, scrutinized the passers by with \na keen, rapid glance. He was irritated that the Mongolia had not yet come in and \nwas questioning the consul on the course of the ship. The consul pointed out that \nthe bank robber might be able to successfully hide in England itself, without \nleaving the country. This observation furnished the detective food for thought, \nand meanwhile the consul went away to his office. Fix had a feeling that the robber \nwould be on board the Mongolia.<PARAGRAPH>When the ship came in, Fix carefully examined \neach face and figure, which made its appearance. One of the passengers came up \nto him and politely asked if he could point out the English consulate, at the \nsame time showing a passport which he wished to have validated. Fix took the passport, \nand with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer. An involuntary motion \nof surprise nearly escaped him, for the description in the passport was identical \nwith that of the bank robber, which he had received from Scotland Yard. He found \nout that the passport was that of the man's master and he advised the questioner \nthat for getting the passport validated, the master would have to make an appearance \nhimself at the Consulate.<PARAGRAPH>Notes\nVerne must have had a very good \nknowledge of the routes of most ships and steamers. This wisdom is evident in \nhis descriptions, of means of passage in the entire novel on the journey around \nthe world. Mongolia was one of the fastest steamers belonging to the company, \nalways making more than ten knots an hour between Brindisi and Suez, and nine \nand a half between Suez and Bombay. It is for the ship Mongolia that two men are \nseen waiting for at the wharf. These two are surrounded by many natives and strangers \nwho were sojourning at this once straggling village now, thanks to the enterprise \nof M. Lesseps, a fast growing town.<PARAGRAPH>The reader is introduced to another \nmajor character in the novel - Detective Fix. He will prove to be a major hindrance \nin Fogg's plans, as we shall soon see. Many other detectives besides Fix were \nsent out to trace the robber who stole fifty five thousand pounds from the Bank \nof England.<PARAGRAPH>It was Fix's task to narrowly watch every passenger who arrived \nat Suez, and to follow up all who seemed to be suspicious characters, or bore \na resemblance to the description of the criminal, which he had received two days \nbefore from the police headquarters at London. Fix is impatient. He is eager to \ncatch hold of the criminal and he has a gut feeling that the robber is on the \nship Mongolia. Fix is represented as a cocky man who thinks himself to be very \nrational, but is not so. He jumps to conclusions readily and is too hasty in assuming \nthat the robber would have to be on this ship only. As Jules Verne himself writes \n- \"So you say, consul,\" asked he for the twentieth time, \"that \nthis steamer is never behind time?\"<PARAGRAPH>\"No, Mr. Fix,\" replied \nthe consul. \"She was bespoken yesterday at Port Said, and the rest of the \nway is of no account to such a craft. I repeat that the Mongolia has been in advance \nof the time required by the company's regulations, and gained the prize awarded \nfor excess of speed.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"Does she come directly from Brindisi?\"<PARAGRAPH>Directly from Brindisi; she takes on the Indian mails there, and she left \nthere Saturday at five p.m. Have patience, Mr. Fix; she will not be late. But \nreally, I don't see how, from the description you have, you will be able to recognize \nyour man, even if he is on board the Mongolia.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"A man rather \nfeels the presence of these fellows, consul, than recognizes them. You must have \na scent for them, and a scent is like a sixth sense which combines hearing, seeing, \nand smelling. I've arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time, and, \nif my thief is on board, I'll answer for it; he'll not slip through my fingers.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"I hope so, Mr. Fix, for it was a heavy robbery.\" \"A magnificent \nrobbery, consul; fifty-five thousand pounds! We don't often have such windfalls. \nBurglars are getting to be so contemptible nowadays! A fellow gets hung for a \nhandful of shillings!\"<PARAGRAPH>\"Mr. Fix,\" said the consul, \"I \nlike your way of talking, and hope you'll succeed; but I fear you will find it \nfar from easy. Don't you see, the description which you have there has a singular \nresemblance to an honest man?\"<PARAGRAPH>\"Consul,\" remarked the detective, \ndogmatically, \"great robbers always resemble honest folks. Fellows who have \nrascally faces have only one course to take, and that is to remain honest; otherwise \nthey would be arrested off-hand. The artistic thing is, to unmask honest countenances; \nit's no light task, I admit, but a real art.\"<PARAGRAPH>The detective betrays \nhis overconfidence in this conversation. We realize even more his foolishness \nwhen it is compared with Fogg's rationality.<PARAGRAPH>Little by little the scene \non the quay became more animated; sailors of various nations, merchants, ship \nbrokers, and porters bustled to and fro as if the steamer were immediately expected. \nThe weather was clear, and slightly chilly. The minarets of the town loomed above \nthe houses in the pale rays of the sun. A jetty pier, some two thousand yards \nalong, extended into the roadstead. A number of fishing-smacks and coasting boats, \nsome retaining the fantastic fashion of ancient galleys, were discernible on the \nRed Sea. Jules Verne is excellent in lively portraits and it is a treat to read \nhis short, yet animated descriptions.<PARAGRAPH>Fix gets even more impatient when \nthe steamer does not come in at the stipulated time. It was now half past ten.<PARAGRAPH>\"The steamer doesn't come!\" he exclaimed, as the port clock \nstruck.<PARAGRAPH>\"She can't be far off now,\" returned his companion.<PARAGRAPH>\"How long will she stop at Suez?\"<PARAGRAPH>\"Four hours; \nlong enough to get in her coal. It is thirteen hundred and ten miles from Suez \nto Aden, at the other end of the Red Sea, and she has to take in a fresh coal \nsupply.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"And does she go from Suez directly to Bombay?\"<PARAGRAPH>\"Without putting in anywhere.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"Good!\" said \nFix. \"If the robber is on board he will no doubt get off at Suez, so as to \nreach the Dutch or French colonies in Asia by some other route. He ought to know \nthat he would not be safe an hour in India, which is English soil.\"<PARAGRAPH>\"Unless,\" objected the consul, \"he is exceptionally shrewd. An \nEnglish criminal, you know, is always better concealed in London than anywhere \nelse.\"<PARAGRAPH>Fix can only think of the robber that he may be able to catch. \nHe thinks - If the robber had indeed left London intending to reach the New World, \nhe would naturally take the route via India, which was less watched and more difficult \nto watch than that of the Atlantic. But Fix's reflections were soon interrupted \nby a succession of sharp whistles, which announced the arrival of the Mongolia. \nThe porters rushed down the quay, and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore \nto go and meet the steamer. Soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along between \nthe banks, and eleven o'clock struck as she anchored in the road. She brought \nan unusual number of passengers, some of who remained on deck to scan the picturesque \npanorama of the town, while the greater part disembarked in the boats, and landed \non the quay.<PARAGRAPH>Passerpartout approaches Fix to help him. He wishes to know \nwhere the consulate is. When Fix sees Fogg's passport, he feels that he has found \nthe robber, as the face and figure of Fogg is very much like the description of \nthe probable robber given out by the English police. When he learns that the passport \nbelongs to the master of the bearer, he explains that the person desirous of the \nvisa should personally approach the consul. After inquiring about of the directions \nto the Consulate Passepartout leaves to deliver this message to his master Phileas \nFogg. It is in Fix's interest that Fogg come himself to the consulate, that Fix \nmight be able to arrest him.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417141554/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Around_The_World_In_80_Days/Around_The_World_In_Eighty_Days11.html"}
