{"name": "chapter xiv", "summary": "A heavy rainstorm hits the city, but this does not stop the characters \n        from going out to dinner, because all the sidewalks are covered by a vast \n        waterproof covering. Doctor Leete draws a comparison between Julian Wests \n        time and that of the twentieth century, insofar as the two ages deal with \n        the rain. In the age of individualism, everyone had a separate umbrella; \n        in this new age, a communal umbrella covers all.<PARAGRAPH>The dining hall is very elegant. The Leetes have their own dining room. \n        A waiter comes in to take their orders and Julian West notices him with \n        great interest. When he leaves, Julian West exclaims over his ease of \n        manner in performing such a menial task as waiting tables. Edith Leete \n        points out that the word, menial, is obsolete. Doctor Leete explains \n        that all work is regarded as equally dignified. Here, the waiters are \n        part of the unclassified grade of the industrial army. In fact, Doctor \n        Leete served as a waiter in his youth.<PARAGRAPH>After dinner they go to a public hall so magnificent that Julian West \n        is astonished. It has every kind of entertainment the community may need \n        and is sumptuously decorated. Doctor Leete explains that all the nations \n        wealth goes to the public space and common needs, and people live simply \n        in their private lives. He says that all the industrial and professional \n        guilds have such clubhouses and that there are also many of these clubhouses \n        in mountain and seaside resorts.<PARAGRAPH>At the end of the chapter, Julian West offers a note to his readers \n        about the late nineteenth-century practice of young college men working \n        as waiters during their summer breaks to help pay their expenses during \n        the year. People of the ruling class raised an uproar about this, saying \n        that these men could never be gentlemen if they worked as waiters. Julian \n        West notes that such shame will always be inherent in any system that \n        sets a price on service. He praises his twentieth-century readers for \n        the dignity they have given labor by refusing to set a price on it and \n        abolishing the marketplace forever. By making honor the only reward for \n        service, they have given all work the distinction that only soldiers got \n        in the nineteenth century.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025235/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Looking_Backward_Bellamy/Looking_Backward_Study_Guide12.html"}
