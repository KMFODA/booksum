Knowing \n        his master Cedrics hatred of Normans, Wamba, with sheer mischief, gives \n        them wrong and confusing directions. However, they soon meet a Palmer, \n        a holy man who has traveled to the Holy Land on a pilgrimage, who takes \n        them safely to Cedrics mansion.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide07.html"}
