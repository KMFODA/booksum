{"name": "chapters 40 - 42", "summary": "In an earlier chapter, Prince John is seen losing the loyalty of most \n        of his knights except that of Waldemar Fitzurse, who slips out of the \n        banqueting hall to confront King Richard before he takes back his power. \n        On their way to Athelstane's castle of Coningsburgh to bury him, the Black \n        Knight and Wamba are ambushed by Fitzurse and his men. Richard sounds \n        his horn to summon Locksley and his outlaws. With their help, he overcomes \n        and kills his attackers. Only Fitzurse is left alive. The king banishes \n        him forever from England and confiscates his lands.<PARAGRAPH>The Black Knight then reveals himself as the rightful King of England. \n        He and Ivanhoe proceed to Coningsburgh. Athelstane, who has only been \n        knocked unconscious and not killed, now rises to tell his story. Ivanhoe \n        rides on, prepared and ready to champion Rebecca's fate.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide17.html"}
