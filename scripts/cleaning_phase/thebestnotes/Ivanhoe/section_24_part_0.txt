{"name": "chapters 37 - 39", "summary": "The scene is set for Rebecca's trial. The Grand Master sits opposite \n        a pile of logs, which will form the stake at which Rebecca will be burned \n        alive if she is found guilty. The charges against Bois-Guilbert are read \n        first, but he is excused on the grounds that Rebecca's evil magic has \n        taken away his power of reason. Others testify to the supernatural powers \n        of Rebecca, her healing of Ivanhoe, and her presence and influence at \n        the attack on Torquilstone. The common people are on her side, deeply \n        affected by her beauty and her defense; but it is not a fair trial. Bois-Guilbert \n        tries to save Rebecca by asking for a champion to fight him on her behalf; \n        however, he suspects no one will come to her aid against him. He then \n        tries in vain to convince Rebecca to run away with him.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide16.html"}
