{"name": "chapter 10", "summary": "As soon as Ivanhoe, in the guise of the Disinherited Knight, reaches \n        his tent on the first day of the tournament, he is presented with the \n        rich armor, weapons, and horses of the knights he has defeated. He accepts \n        his rewards from four of the five knights. He refuses the gifts of Bois-Guilbert, \n        however, and sends a message that he will meet the Templar Knight again \n        in combat on the following day.<PARAGRAPH>With some of the money from his rewards, Ivanhoe sends Gurth, who is \n        now his confidante, to Isaac to pay for the horse and armor which he so \n        generously loaned to him for the tournament. Isaac takes the money, but \n        Rebecca secretly sends it back, adding twenty gold coins as a tip for \n        Gurth.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide10.html"}
