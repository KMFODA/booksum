{"name": "chapter 1", "summary": "The novel begins in England during the reign of King Richard I, also \n        known as Richard the Lion-Hearted . Scott provides some historical \n        background for the politics of the time and places the action somewhere \n        near the end of Richards reign when he is returning from the Crusades. \n        Englands Saxon population is under the control of Norman royalty. French \n        has become the forced official language, a fact which both angers and \n        demeans the Saxons, and many landowners have been forced to give their \n        lands to their Norman rulers. When the action of the novel begins, the \n        Norman King Richard I has been captured and held for ransom in Europe. \n        His brother John has assumed power. Though both men are Norman rulers \n        in Saxon populated England, Richard is more popular among the people he \n        rules, known as both fair and courageous; John is aggressive, encouraging \n        his men to steal or destroy everything Saxon. John is content to rule, \n        and even hopes his brother remains imprisoned so that he can become king. \n        Richards loyal subjects despair of ever seeing him again, and are angry \n        that John and his greedy nobles have been aggressive and relentless in \n        seizing whatever Saxon land they can.<PARAGRAPH>A swineherd named Gurth is talking with a jester, Wamba, about the increasing \n        hostility between the native Saxons and the Norman rulers. Both servants \n        work for a loyal Saxon named Cedric. When a storm approaches, they head \n        for home. On their way, they hear horsemen riding toward them.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Ivanhoe_Sir_Walter_Scott/Ivanhoe_Study_Guide07.html"}
