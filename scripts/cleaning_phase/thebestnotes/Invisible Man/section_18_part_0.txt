{"name": "chapter 18", "summary": "One day the narrator receives an anonymous letter warning him to back off in the Brotherhood or the white men in the \nBrotherhood will remove him. The narrator is upset and confused by the letter and cannot find out who wrote it. He is \ntold by Brother Tarp not to worry; as long as a few support him, he will still be able to do his work. Tarp then tells the \nnarrator about his lame leg. For nineteen years, he dragged a chain on that leg because he would not let some one take \nsomething that was his. He finally broke the chain and escaped. Tarp pulls out the link of chain he broke to free himself \nand gives it to the narrator as a reminder of why they are fighting for the blacks. The narrator slips the link around his \nfinger up and hits the letter on the desk. He does not want the link, but feels obligated to accept it, like a son would accept \nan out-of-date watch from his father.<PARAGRAPH>Brother Wrestrum enters the office and slouches down into a chair, looking nervously over the narrator's desk. The \nnarrator feels he is a snoop and does not know his true function in the Brotherhood. He only understands that Wrestrum \nhas some amount of power within the organization. Wrestrum asks about the link on the desk. When the narrator \nexplains what it is, he tells him he should not display such things, because it points out people's differences. He says that \nthose differences are what the Brotherhood is fighting against. Wrestrum goes on to explain how those in the \nBrotherhood must watch themselves and get rid of anything that does not make for a Brotherhood. The narrator begins to \nwonder if Wrestrum wrote the letter. He pulls the letter out, playing with it, and drops it on top of the link. Wrestrum \nlooks at it, but shows no recognition. The narrator is disappointed not to have found the author. Wrestrum warns the \nnarrator that not everyone in the Brotherhood believes in the Brotherhood. The narrator is horrified by the idea that \nanyone would be forced to shake his hand or call him brother.<PARAGRAPH>Wrestrum explains how he seeks to find whatever is in him that is against the Brotherhood and expel it from himself \ndaily. He confesses that the most common element is resentment, but he keeps it checked and cleaned out. Wrestrum \nthen proceeds to ask the narrator about creating some way for black brothers to recognize each other, some sort of \nBrotherhood emblem that they might wear. Wrestrum tells him how Clifton was in a scuffle and got confused and began \nbeating up a white brother. He thinks that perhaps an emblem would help this problem. Their conversation is interrupted \nwhen the narrator receives a call to be interviewed as a hero for a local youth magazine. He tries to refuse, but ends up \naccepting. Wrestrum leaves after the phone call.<PARAGRAPH>About two weeks pass, and the narrator attends a meeting where Wrestrum calls a complaint on him before the committee. \nAs he is being accused, the narrator notices a certain spark of pleasure in Jack's eyes as he scribbles on a pad. Wrestrum \naccuses him of being a petty individualist, sabotaging the Brotherhood by exploiting it for his own purposes. He offers \nthe magazine article as proof, saying that the interview was arranged by the narrator to celebrate himself as an exceptional \nindividual. The narrator denies offering anything but the standard explanation of the organization and regular literature \nhandouts when speaking to the reporter. He is asked to step out momentarily while the committee discusses the matter.<PARAGRAPH>He is called back in the room and dismissed of the charges of being an enemy, \n        but questions remain about the magazine article. The narrator is furious \n        that the charges were made in the first place; however, the situation \n        is explained to him in such a logical manner that he feels he must accept. \n        A charge was made and, right or wrong, they have an obligation to investigate. \n        Now they ask him to relocate until all charges against him may be cleared. \n        He has been reassigned to speak on behalf of feminist issues. He is disappointed, \n        but too ambitious to refuse relocation. He will speak on anything important \n        for the Brotherhood as long as he can advance. The narrator decides that \n        the relocation is an expression of the Brotherhood's unbroken faith in \n        him. After all, he is being asked to address a taboo topic and open the \n        Brotherhood to women. He leaves with misguided optimism.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Invisible_Man_Ellison/Invisible_Man_Study_Guide17.html"}
