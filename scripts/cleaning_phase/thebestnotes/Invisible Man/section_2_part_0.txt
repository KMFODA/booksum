{"name": "chapter 2", "summary": "His days at the Negro college offer many experiences for the narrator to recount. He remembers how he often fantasized \nof forbidden places, such as the road to the insane asylum. He recalls the nearby prostitutes, in whom he saw great \nsadness. He also remembers the perplexing statue in front of the school. It was of a father figure holding a veil halfway \nover a slave's head; one could not be certain if the veil were being lifted or fitted more securely. He recalls the way the \nschool was conducted, almost militarily. He also pictures the frequent visits of the millionaire benefactors, whose \ncontributions paid for the school. He remembers a particular occasion when he was assigned to be a driver for one of the \nmillionaires, Mr. Norton. The narrator finds himself identifying with this rich man, who appreciates tradition and talks of \nhis good intentions concerning black people. He tells the narrator about his grief over his deceased daughter and claims \nthat everything he does, including deeds for the black community, is done in memory of her. As a result of the \nmillionaires encouragement, the narrator opts to take a new route, a forbidden road. He is then overcome with guilt as he \nremembers his grandfathers words.<PARAGRAPH>The two men arrive at the house of Jim Trueblood, a black man who is looked down upon by the entire black community. \nMr. Trueblood's wife and daughter are both pregnant, and the narrator tells the millionaire that Mr. Trueblood is the father \nof both. Mr. Norton is shocked by the incest and wants to talk to Mr. Trueblood about it. When Mr. Norton approaches \nhim, Mr. Trueblood tells his story. He explains how poor his family is. They have no heat and no beds; when they sleep \non the floor, they stay close to each other to keep warm. He claims to have been having a dream when he awoke to find \nhimself on his daughter, Matty Lou. Kate, Matty Lou's mother, woke up and pointed a shotgun at him. Eventually, she \ninjured him with an ax.. Mr. Trueblood says that no one in the black community believes his story, not even the preacher.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Trueblood says the white men in town have asked him to re-tell his story over and over to different people, as if they \nwere pleased with the tale. In fact, they gave him some new clothing for his family, gave him some work, and allowed \nhim to stay on the land where he now lives. Mr. Trueblood ends by talking about his confusion; he has done one of the \nworst things a person can do, but the white community has seemed to embrace him for it, treating him better than he has \never been treated in his life.<PARAGRAPH>Mr. Norton originally wanted to shame Mr. Trueblood for his crime; instead \n        he gave him one hundred dollars, for he was troubled by the story. After \n        leaving Mr. Trueblood, Norton asks the narrator to take him somewhere \n        quickly for some whiskey, for he feels a little faint over the entire \n        incident. The narrator is worried about Mr. Norton and drives him to a \n        nearby dive called the Golden Day, where he can get a drink.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Invisible_Man_Ellison/Invisible_Man_Study_Guide07.html"}
