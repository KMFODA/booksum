The narrator \nemphasizes the need to organize the people while they are still upset. The group accuses him of acting without \npermission, and he responds that he has acted out of personal responsibility. They mock him, claiming that Clifton was a \ntraitor given the funeral of a hero. The narrator tries to explain that while Clifton may be defined as a traitor by the \nBrotherhood, he is not defined as such by the Harlem community. The narrator makes the statement that someone, \nsomewhere always accuses others of being traitors. They make fun of the narrator for using the words \"personal \nresponsibility.\" The tension and anger in the room continue to escalate until Jack gets so frenzied that his glass eye pops \nout of its socket. The narrator feels it is a planned incident, designed to throw him off balance. Jack screams that he lost \nhis eye in the line of duty, a lesson in self-sacrifice and discipline. The narrator thinks to himself that Jack's sacrifice has \nmade him blind. He realizes once and for all that Jack does not see him.<PARAGRAPH>Jack and the other men leave. The narrator makes a decision to leave the public \n        eye, to forget about changing history in a public way.
