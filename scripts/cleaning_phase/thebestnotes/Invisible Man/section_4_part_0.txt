{"name": "chapter 4", "summary": "The narrator drops Mr. Norton off on campus after a drive filled with profuse \n        worries and fears about what he has allowed to happen. The narrator tries \n        to apologize to Mr. Norton, but is merely told to send for the school \n        nurse and Dr. Bledsoe. As he goes to get Dr. Bledsoe, he worries about \n        losing the one identity he has as a student at the school. He tells Dr. \n        Bledsoe that he took Mr. Norton to the old slave quarters because Mr. \n        Norton requested it. Dr. Bledsoe tells the narrator that he was responsible \n        for the incident, not Mr. Norton. When they arrive at Mr. Norton's room, \n        Dr. Bledsoe tells Mr. Norton that the student driver, the narrator, will \n        be reprimanded. The narrator defends himself, and Norton says he will \n        tell Dr. Bledsoe the whole story. He confirms that the narrator is not \n        responsible for the day's trouble. The narrator is asked to leave the \n        two men alone. He returns to his room to worry about what will happen \n        to him. Finally, he is sent for. When he arrives at the room, he finds \n        Mr. Norton waiting alone. The benefactor reassures the narrator that he \n        told Dr. Bledsoe nothing was his fault and that he should meet Dr. Bledsoe \n        after Chapel. The narrator is relieved and heads for the Chapel.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Invisible_Man_Ellison/Invisible_Man_Study_Guide08.html"}
