{"name": "chapter 8", "summary": "The narrator prepares to interview for jobs. He goes out in the morning to offices of the men to whom his letters are \naddressed. Each time he gets to an office, he is met by a secretary. His letter is taken and he is told he will be written a \nletter of response. Walking down the street, he begins to wonder about the white in New York. He eats next to them and \nrides the subway with them. They do not seem to have an air of too much self-importance, and they apologize whenever \nthey bump into him. Yet he feels certain they do not acknowledge him in their politeness. Their reactions are mechanical, \nfor he is invisible to them.<PARAGRAPH>The narrator grows impatient, not hearing from the employers to whom he has \n        given his letters. He only has one letter remaining. He does not send \n        this last one, for he knows the man is out of town, and he suspects his \n        letters rarely make it past the secretaries. He spends some time typing \n        a perfect letter to the last man, requesting an appointment wherein he \n        will pass on a message from Dr. Bledsoe. He waits anxiously and finally \n        a letter from this man, Mr. Emerson, arrives.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025232/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Invisible_Man_Ellison/Invisible_Man_Study_Guide10.html"}
